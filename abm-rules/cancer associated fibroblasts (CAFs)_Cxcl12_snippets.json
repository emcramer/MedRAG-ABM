        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a role in tumour initiation and progression, possibly by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a series of cellular changes that is known to underlie the process of metastasis. The aim of this study was to determine whether CAFs and surrounding normal breast fibroblasts (NBFs) are able to induce EMT markers and functional changes in breast epithelial cancer cells. Matched pairs of CAFs and NBFs were established from fresh human breast cancer specimens and characterised by assessment of CXCL12 levels, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels and response to doxorubicin. The fibroblasts were then co-cultured with MCF7 cells. Vimentin and E-cadherin expressions were determined in co-cultured MCF7 cells by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as well as by western blotting and quantitative PCR. Co-cultured MCF7 cells were also assessed functionally by invasion assay. CAFs secreted higher levels of CXCL12 and expressed higher levels of \u03b1-SMA compared with NBFs. CAFs were also less sensitive to doxorubicin as evidenced by less H2AX phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis on flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V compared with NBFs. When co-cultured with MCF7 cells, there was greater vimentin and less E-cadherin expression as well as greater invasiveness in MCF7 cells co-cultured with CAFs compared with those co-cultured with NBFs. CAFs have the ability to induce a greater degree of EMT in MCF7 cell lines, indicating that CAFs contribute to a more malignant breast cancer phenotype and their role in influencing therapy resistance should therefore be considered when treating breast cancer.",

Histological examinations of human tumors show greater stromal content in more advanced and larger tumors, and high content of stromal cells correlates with greater risk of relapse and reduced survival. Fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cell type in epithelial tumors. Cancer cells dynamically activate surrounding fibroblasts to produce growth factors, hormones, and cytokines that fuel tumor growth, and facilitate progression to metastasis. These activated fibroblasts, termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulate cancer cells through paracrine signaling and direct intercellular interactions. In a study of breast carcinoma, about 80 percent of fibroblasts exhibited an activated phenotype.Production of the chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1) is a hallmark feature of CAFs. CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors upregulated on cancer cells, and activates multiple molecular pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Signaling through these pathways promotes survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly active in breast cancers. Analysis of human breast tumors showed that among the different molecular subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells have the most elevated expression of CXCR4. Considering the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, disrupting this chemokine signaling may offer a potential new therapeutic approach. In addition, investigating pathways downstream of this chemokine signaling axis in TNBC cells potentially will unveil new molecular targets for therapy.Studies of interactions among stroma and cancer cells typically use monolayer cell cultures or xenograft models. Monolayer cultures lack the complexity of tumors including a compact three-dimensional morphology, close intercellular contacts, exposure of cells to gradients of soluble factors and oxygen, and non-uniform, spatially-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, cells in monolayer cultures often fail to reproduce key characteristics of tumors. Xenografts present a physiological system for cancer research. However, they are limited in terms of absence of human tumor stroma, failure of some murine cytokines to activate human receptors, disparities in dynamics of tumor growth and progression compared to human tumors, and need for complex tools and biological assays to study stromal effects on cancer cells. Since the introduction of tissue microarrays and next generation sequencing, these technologies have been used for high throughput assessment of biomarkers in thousands of tumor samples from biopsies using standard assays such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridization. These technologies are an invaluable tool in clinical oncology to develop diagnostic tests and identify disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, tissue microarrays and similar biopsy-based assays for endpoint analysis of fixed samples do not capture dynamic tumor-stromal interactions in tumor microenvironments. Tumors constantly transform both spatially and temporally. Interactions between stromal and cancer cells play a major role in conferring functional changes to cancer cells such as gain of cancer stem cell and mesenchymal characteristics, altered metabolism, drug resistance, migration and invasion, and survival. Mechanistic understanding of these complex events in tumors requires approaches that reproduce dynamic signaling of cancer and stromal cells as it occurs in native tissues.Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of cells as spheroids provide relevant in vitro tumor models to recapitulate architecture and complex intercellular network of tumors and emulate stromal-cancer cells interactions. We recently developed a robotic, high throughput spheroid microprinting technology to mass produce homogenously-sized spheroids that exhibit key biology properties of solid tumors. Here, we utilized this technology and formed an array of co-culture spheroids of TNBC and stromal cells to examine CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on TNBC cells. Using different cellular assays and molecular analyses, we demonstrated that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling significantly increases spheroid proliferation and TNBC cell growth. This signaling conferred resistance to standard chemotherapy drug treatment through activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. We found that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling induces sensitivity of the cancer cells to specific molecular inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways, preventing proliferation of TNBC cells. This work establishes the feasibility of studying tumor-stromal interactions using our engineered solid tumor models and offers a convenient preclinical tool to identify new treatment approaches.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting of TNBC-stromal cells co-culture spheroidsThe ATPS technology facilitates partitioning of cancer and stromal cells to the DEX phase nanodrop to spontaneously form a mono-culture or a co-culture spheroid within 24\u201348 hours of incubation (Figure 1A\u20131B). Importantly, nutrients and waste products of cells freely diffuse between the DEX phase nanodrop and the immersion PEG phase. Adapting the technology to robotics enabled formation of spheroids in standard 384-microwell plates. For co-culture spheroids, we selected a ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells and a total cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/0.3 \u03bcl of DEX phase drop. This ratio was to mimic more advanced and larger human breast tumors that have greater stromal content than cancer cells. Using larger ratios of 1:3 and 1:4 (breast cancer cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial breast cancer cell density constant at 5 \u00d7 103 cells per DEX phase drop did not alter growth of TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure 1), consistent with other studies. This microprinting approach gave consistently-sized mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells), mono-culture spheroids of fibroblast cells, HMF and CAFs, (1 \u00d7 104 cells), and co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF cells or CAFs (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells with a 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells ratio) (Figure 1C). The spheroid size consistency was measured from two separate experiments to ensure that spheroids of each model had a similar initial metabolic activity baseline. Importantly, the 1.5 \u00d7 104 cell density co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells or CAFs were not statistically different in size (p > 0.05), eliminating potential effects of size differences of the spheroids on the studies reported below. We conveniently maintained spheroids in the same 384-microwell plate used for spheroid formation by robotic exchange of culture medium.(A\u2013B) Cancer cells remain confined in the 0.3 \u00b5l DEX phase drop (purple) suspended in the immiscible immersion PEG phase (pink) and autonomously aggregate to form a co-culture spheroid of triple negative breast cancer cells (green) and human mammary fibroblasts (red) in 48 hrs. Colors in panel (A) are for presentation purpose only. (C) Resulting spheroids of different co-culture models are consistently sized with low standard errors.Effect of TNBC-stromal cells signaling on cellular metabolic activity of spheroidsTo investigate the effect of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 receptors on the proliferation of cells in 3D cultures, we generated eight different co-culture spheroids that contained at least one element of this chemokine-receptor(s) signaling or completely lacked them: (i) TNBC:HMF, (ii) TNBC:CAFs, (iii) CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, (iv) CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, (v) CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, (vi) CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, (vii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and (viii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. The co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF that lacked this signaling served as the global negative control. Spheroids were evaluated for their cellular proliferation over a six-day period following formation and in medium containing only 1% FBS at the starting point and no renewal (Figure 2A). The TNBC:CAFs model displayed either a lower or fairly similar activity compared to the TNBC:HMF model, indicating that CXCL12 production by CAFs does not confer growth advantage to TNBC cells lacking the cognate receptors of the chemokine. On the other hand, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model showed overall the highest and continuously increasing activity throughout the culture compared to all the other co-culture spheroids. The CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model also consistently showed 11\u201328% greater activity than its CXCR4+TNBC:HMF counterpart lacking the CXCL12 chemokine as determined by a linear regression analysis. There was no significant difference between cell proliferation in CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids. Interestingly, these models even had lower activity level than the TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs spheroids on each day of measurement. When the effect of expression of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cell proliferation was evaluated, the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs model had slightly increased activity, up to 4.5%, than the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF spheroids on certain days. Our statistical analysis of the multivariate, temporally-dependent data resulting from all eight co-culture spheroid models showed that cell proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was significantly different from the seven other models across the six-day culture period (Figure 2B).(A) Growth of co-culture spheroids based on metabolic activity measurements is shown over a six-day period. Spheroids consist of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells at a ratio of 1:2 TNBC:fibroblasts at the starting point of experiments. (B) p-values from a statistical test show that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model is consistently and significantly more proliferative than all the other models.Consistent with reports in mouse models, our finding suggests that the CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 axis is a key mediator of cell proliferation in breast cancer. The effect of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling on promoting primary and metastatic breast tumor growth has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. Several studies have reported that CXCR7 is a scavenger receptor to prevent saturation of CXCR4 receptors and also to create CXCL12 gradients to facilitate migration of CXCR4+ cancer cells. This provides a plausible explanation for the similar activity levels of the CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture models. We note that the role of the CXCR7 receptor in the presence of CXCL12 signaling remains disputed. For example, studies show that CXCR7 expression lead to growth of primary breast tumors in rat models through promoting angiogenesis, which is consistent with data showing upregulation of this receptor on tumor vasculature. However, results from these studies cannot be correlated with those from our 3D cultures that represent models of avascular tumors. Altogether, these data demonstrate that our 3D cultures recapitulate growth properties of breast tumors. Based on analysis of the data, we selected the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and its respective negative control, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, for mechanistic studies of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling in TNBC.Inhibition and stimulation of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingWe conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate if the higher proliferative activity of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was indeed due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling. The experiments included an inhibition test and a stimulation test. First, we treated spheroids with AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 that blocks the CXCR4 receptor. Consistently throughout the six-day culture, this treatment reduced proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model that lacks CXCL12 (Figure 3A). Next, we treated the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium of CAFs. This stimulation elevated the proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 3B). In both cases, our analysis showed minimal statistically significant differences between the treated and non-treated co-culture models. Collectively, these results established that greater proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model than the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroid model was due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling.(A) Treatment of CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) normalizes proliferation to level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture. (B) Treating CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium from CAFs stimulates proliferation to that of CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids.Evaluation of cancer cell growth in spheroids due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingThe above study based on metabolic activity of cells provided a measure of stromal-cancer cells signaling effect on the overall growth of spheroids. Considering that activated stromal cells (CAFs) in breast tumors also proliferate, we investigated to what extent greater overall growth results from proliferation of CXCR4+ TNBC cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids compared with other spheroid models shown in Figure 2A. Measurements of the endogenous eGFP signal of the cancer cells showed that cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display a statistically significant (p < 0.05) growth increase throughout the measurement window (Figure 4A). Linear regression analysis showed that CXCR4+TNBC cells in this model had an 11.4% larger growth slope over time than their counterparts in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. This indicates that CAFs confer increasingly greater proliferative activity to the breast cancer cells. To validate this result, we evaluated growth of cancer cells in co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs that lacked both elements of the signaling axis or CXCR4 receptor expression, respectively. Despite some random differences in growth of cancer cells between the two models on several days, the slope of linear regression was smaller by 2% in the co-culture containing CAFs (Figure 4B). Thus, these results established the role of CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling on enhanced growth of breast cancer cells.Proliferation of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids measured using their endogenous eGFP signal(A) TNBC cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display consistently greater proliferation compared to spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture model and CXCR4+TNBC single culture with a larger slope of 11.4% and 77.1%, respectively. (B) TNBC cells lacking CXCR4 expression in co-culture with HMF and CAFs show a similar proliferation. (C\u2013D) Morphology of resulting co-culture spheroids and mono-culture spheroids of breast cancer cells on days 1, 3, and 6 (left to right). Error bars represent standard error of mean. (E\u2013F) Confocal images of the co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells on day 4. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.TNBC cells in all four co-culture spheroid models displayed a larger growth than their respective mono-culture spheroids generated with the same density of 5 \u00d7 103 breast cancer cells. The slope of linear regression of growth curves was 5.0 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and TNBC:CAFs co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. Similarly, the regression line slope was 4.4 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and TNBC:HMF co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. This implies a major role for heterotypic cellular signaling in tumors and suggests that breast cancer cells induce the normal fibroblasts to produce soluble factors to promote growth of malignant cells. Studies show that cancer cells produce growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) that activate the adjacent stromal cells, which in turn secrete signaling molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to promote proliferation of cancer cells. The larger growth rate of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids compared to the respective CXCR4+TNBC mono-culture spheroids may be mediated by soluble factors secreted by CXCR4-expressing cancer cells to transform HMF cells to CAFs.Morphologically, mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and TNBC became more compact by day six of culture. Co-culturing breast cancer cells and fibroblasts significantly enhanced compactness of spheroids earlier, indicating that fibroblasts facilitate spheroid formation of breast cancer cells (Figure 4C\u20134D). The co-culture models containing CXCR4+TNBC cells exhibited a compact morphology for several days with minimal increases of volume (9\u201315%) from days 1 to 3. But over time, the co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and HMF cells showed separation of fibroblast and cancer cells with an 82% volume increase from days 3 to 6. This is likely due to the expression of incompatible junctional proteins in breast cancer and fibroblast cells. For example, it was shown that intercellular adhesion was dependent on cadherins expression of each cell type, and only cells that expressed the same type of cadherins intermixed. Notably, the separation behavior was observed considerably more in the TNBC:HMF co-culture model and was further demonstrated through confocal imaging in Figure 4E\u20134F. Expression of CXCR4 on TNBC cells largely prevented separation from HMF cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. Additionally, inclusion of CAFs, regardless of CXCR4 expression on TNBC cells, blocked the segregation effect and helped the spheroids retain a compact morphology, mimicking the unique characteristic of CAFs to infiltrate tumor masses. All spheroids displayed shedding of TNBC cells from their peripheries on later days of culture, suggesting that active proliferation of border cells is somewhat compensated by cell shedding. We note that a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these morphological differences in co-culture spheroids requires a more extensive analysis.Molecular analysis of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on cancer cell proliferation in spheroidsWe evaluated proliferation of both breast cancer and stromal cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids using IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids and quantifying Ki-67+ proliferative cells. Breast cancer and stromal cells showed statistically significant higher proliferation (p < 0.05) in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 5). When co-cultured with CAFs, the CXCR4+TNBC cells showed 1.4 times greater Ki-67 staining, in agreement with results based on eGFP signal measurements (Figure 4). Additionally, CAFs in the co-culture model had a remarkably two-fold higher Ki-67 staining compared to HMF cells. This is consistent with increased proliferation of CAFs in tumor tissues, and the overall greater stromal content in more aggressive and larger tumors. We note that the CAFs secrete mCherry-tagged CXCL12 into the medium, whereas the HMF cells contain mCherry signal in their nuclei. This is the reason for visual differences between the red fluorescence images of CAFs and HMF cells in Figure 5. To avoid relying on the mCherry signal for quantification of cell proliferation, we used the Ki-67+ and eGFP signal of breast cancer cells to quantify proliferative TNBC cells, and then subtracted this value from the total Ki-67+ fluorescence to quantify proliferation of stromal cells (CAFs or HMF) in their respective co-cultures.Proliferation of CXCR4+TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HMF and CAFs) in co-culture spheroids characterized through measurements of Ki-67+ proliferative cells using immunostained images of cryosections of 4-day old spheroids. Both cancer cells and fibroblasts show significantly greater proliferation in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model (blue bars). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Next, we investigated molecular mechanisms for increased proliferation of stromal and breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 axis may activate multiple pathways in cancer cells. We focused on ERK and AKT, two prominent drivers of proliferation in breast cancer and other malignancies. Western blot analysis relative to the total protein and \u03b2-actin expression of each co-culture system showed that cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids had moderately higher levels of p-ERK (Figure 6A) and substantially higher levels of p-AKT (Figure 6B) compared to CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. The displayed immunoblots were quantified (normalized to their respective total and \u03b2-actin protein expressions), showing an 81% increase in the p-AKT/t-AKT levels and a 16% increase in p-ERK/t-ERK levels in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids. Although p-ERK increase is modest, small changes in activation of MAPK components produce much larger effects on overall signaling and biologic outputs. These results suggest that the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling upregulates activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways to support TNBC cells metabolic and growth activities.Western blot analysis of signaling proteins (A) p-ERK and (B) p-AKT in co-cultures of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF and CAFs. Quantified data were normalized to \u03b2-actin protein expression.To further substantiate these results, we conducted IHC analysis of cryosections of co-culture spheroids for ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 7A\u20137B, 7D\u20137E). Quantification of immunostained sections (normalized to total protein expression and highest fluorescent value obtained) showed a similar pattern to Western blotting with a 52% and 28% increase in p-AKT/t-AKT and p-ERK/t-ERK levels, respectively, in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 7C, 7F). We note that high levels of ERK and AKT at the periphery of immunostained sections is due to the positioning of CXCR4+TNBC cells at the periphery of the co-culture spheroids. Fibroblasts were mainly distributed in the center of the sections and showed minimal staining, clear from the composite image in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Movie 1. Therefore, quantification was only performed on the CXCR4+TNBC cells of stained sections.Cryosections of co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (green) with HMF and CAFs immunostained for (A\u2013B) ERK and (D\u2013E) AKT. A blue fluorescent secondary antibody was used to detect ERK and AKT. Images represent spheroids on day 4 of culture. Quantification showed higher (C) ERK and (F) AKT phosphorylation in the CXCR4+TNBC cells when co-cultured with CAFs. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Drug sensitivity of stromal-cancer cells co-culture spheroidsBiochemical interactions of activated stromal cells and cancer cells are suggested as a major cause of drug resistance. To demonstrate the effect of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on drug response of breast cancer cells, we evaluated the sensitivity of co-culture spheroids to a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, to which TNBC patients may develop resistance. Cancer cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids were significantly more resistant to paclitaxel at a 0.1\u201310 nM concentration range than cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids (p < 0.01). The largest difference in cancer cell viability (36%) occurred at a drug concentration of 1 nM (Figure 8). This demonstrates the impact of activated tumor stromal cells on chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells, consistent with several other reports, and that our 3D tumor models recapitulate stromal-mediated drug resistance. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 eliminated resistance to paclitaxel of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model. This result emphasizes the potential to improve response to chemotherapy by targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling.CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids (blue bars) display resistance to paclitaxel treatment but lose resistance to the drug when co-treated with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 (gray bars), similar to the negative control counterpart (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). Images reflect spheroids at the end of drug treatment period (6 days). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.01.To understand the mechanism of paclitaxel resistance, we performed IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids to assess ERK and AKT activity in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF models treated with 1 nM paclitaxel. Following treatment, significantly higher phosphorylation levels of both proteins were maintained in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (p < 0.05), indicating that resistance to paclitaxel due to the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling is mediated by activation of these kinase pathways (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 3). Previous studies showed that paclitaxel resistance strongly correlated with increased activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in breast cancers, supporting our data. Upon co-treatment of spheroids with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100, phosphorylated levels of ERK and AKT in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model treated with paclitaxel normalized to that of control CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. These results collectively demonstrate the promising therapeutic approach of sensitizing TNBC tumors to chemotherapy treatment by disrupting the cancer-stroma signaling and its downstream pathways to overcome stroma-induced cancer cell growth and chemotherapy resistance.Immunohistochemical analysis of drug-treated spheroids indicates that increases in AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels in CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids contribute to paclitaxel resistance (blue bars). Co-treatment with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, lowers AKT and ERK activities (gray bars) to that observed in the paclitaxel sensitive control culture (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). *p < 0.05.Our findings suggest that greater proliferation and drug resistance of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model is due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling through AKT and ERK. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of these kinase pathways may block enhanced growth of cancer cells and compromise their viability. We treated both co-culture spheroids with specific inhibitors of MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and PI3K/AKT (PI-103) at a wide concentration range for a six-day period. Effectiveness of the inhibitors was assessed by eGFP detection of breast cancer cells in treated groups relative to their respective negative control group (no treatment) and presented as percent cell viability. We found that breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model were more sensitive to PD0325901 treatment below 100 nM (Figure 10A) and PI-103 treatment below 1 \u00b5M (Figure 10B). We further confirmed the reduction in breast cancer cell viability using quantification of fluorescence images of drug-treated spheroids in Figure 10C\u201310D. The largest differences in the viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs and HMF were 23% and 27% at 1 nM of PD0325901 and 0.1 nM of PI-103, respectively. Interestingly, PI-103 at a 0.1 nM concentration reduced breast cancer cell viability in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to 56%. This was consistent with protein expression results that showed significant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 6 and 7) leads to increased growth of the breast cancer cells (Figure 4). This also agrees with a study that showed CXCL12 signaling-mediated drug resistant cancer cells became substantially more sensitive to chemotherapy through AKT inhibition. At higher concentrations, the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor is more effective and reduces the cancer cells viability to less than 10%. Overall, the results corroborate our protein expression study that showed upregulated activity of these two kinase pathways due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling. Although CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 can potentially activate multiple pathways in cancer cells, these results establish signaling to MAPK and PI3K pathways in TNBC cells and the promising result of targeting these pathways to improve cytotoxicity. Considering the activation of both kinase pathways due to this signaling, their simultaneous inhibition using combination treatments with specific molecular inhibitors of AKT and MAPK pathways may result in synergistic inhibition of TNBC cell growth and survival at lower drug concentrations than those with single-agent treatments. Collectively, these results strongly support the utility of our 3D tumor models for cellular and molecular studies of tumor-stromal interactions.Viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with HMF and CAFs treated with a MEK inhibitor, (A) PD0325901, and a PI3K inhibitor, (B) PI-103, measured using the endogenous eGFP signal of the TNBC cells. CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs show greater drug sensitivity to the molecular inhibitors. Images reflect spheroids at end of drug treatment period (5 days). Error bars represent standard error of mean. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.In conclusion, our robotic technology allowed facile generation of co-culture spheroids to conveniently study stromal-cancer (TNBC) cells interactions. We found that CXCL12 from CAFs signaled through CXCR4 on triple negative cancer cells to significantly enhance TNBC cell proliferation. Additionally, CAFs showed greater proliferation than their normal HMF counterpart. Increased proliferation of TNBC cells occurred due to activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, two known effectors of CXCR4 signaling. CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling also conferred resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrated the potential to overcome stromal-mediated drug resistance using small molecule inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways and CXCR4 signaling. Altogether, these findings highlight the power of our model system to identify promising new therapeutic strategies to improve response to therapy in TNBC. Future studies with improved tumor models should address and distinguish effects of stromal cells-deposited ECM signaling and stromal cells-mediated biochemical signaling with cancer cells on the proliferation and drug response of cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) preparationTwo polymers, BioUltra polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma), MW: 35 kDa, and dextran (DEX) (Pharmacosmos), MW: 500 kDa, were utilized to form an aqueous two-phase system, as described previously. Briefly, PEG and DEX were added to the complete cell culture medium at 5.0% (w/v) and 12.8% (w/v), respectively. The polymers were dissolved using a vortex mixer and then incubating in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The polymer solutions were then stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Prior to use, the PEG phase polymer solution was filtered by passing it through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter to remove any impurities.Cell cultureThree different triple negative breast cancer cells were utilized for experiments. The cell lines were: MDA-MB-231 (labeled TNBC), MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR4 receptor (labeled CXCR4+TNBC), and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR7 receptor (labeled CXCR7+TNBC). These cells were previously stably transduced using lentiviral vectors and the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cancer cells was confirmed through flow cytometry. The TNBC cells were additionally stably transduced to express eGFP for detection. In addition, a human mammary fibroblast (HMF) cell line (labeled HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein was utilized. HMF cells were also stably transduced to secrete 0.75 ng/ml/hr of CXCL12-\u03b1 fused with mCherry for tracking, and the resulting cells were labeled as CAFs. CAFs extracted from breast cancer patients secreted varying amounts of CXCL12 in media ranging from 0.9 ng/ml \u2013 2 ng/ml over a 48 hr time period, depending on the patients and the tumor samples. The higher CXCL12 secretion rate of our transduced HMFs accounts for medium renewals and drug additions that consequently dilute the CXCL12 concentration in the medium. To maintain the cells in culture, they were grown in T175 flasks at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 using Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). Once a confluent monolayer formed, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and dissociated using 5 ml trypsin (Life Technologies) in an incubator for \u223c2 min. The cells were then neutralized with 10 ml of the complete growth medium, collected, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, cells were resupsended in 1 ml of fresh medium, and loaded into a hemocytometer for counting.Co-culture spheroid formation using aqueous two-phase system (ATPS)A ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells was used to form co-culture spheroids that model the high stromal content often observed in larger and more advanced human breast tumors. Our initial tests with 1:3 and 1:4 ratios (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial TNBC cell density constant did not make any further changes in the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the selected ratio of 1:2 (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) was used for all the studies. To prepare for forming spheroids, 30 \u03bcl of the PEG phase solution was dispensed into each well of a 384-well plate, labeled as the destination plate. The DEX phase solution was mixed at an equal volume with a specific density of cells (1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monoculture spheroids of TNBC cells, 2 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monocultures spheroids of HMF and CAFs, and 3 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF and TNBC-CAFs). The DEX phase solution and the cell suspension became diluted in half upon mixing resulting in a final polymer concentration of 6.4% (w/v), and densities of 5 \u00d7 103/0.3 \u03bcl TNBC cells in monoculture spheroids, 1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl HMF cells or CAFs in monoculture spheroids, and 1.5 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl in co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF cells or TNBC-CAFs. A source 384-well plate was prepared by loading the wells from a single column with \u223c20 \u03bcl of the solution of mixed DEX phase and cell suspension. A robotic liquid handler (Bravo SRT, Agilent) was programmed to mix the source plate content and aspirate 0.3 \u03bcl from each well. This solution was robotically dispensed as a single drop into each well of the destination plate containing the PEG phase. This process was repeated for all columns of the destination plate. After completion, the destination plate was placed in an incubator to allow cells to aggregate into a single spheroid in each well within 48 hrs. Our studies used a total of eight co-culture models: TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC: HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. Images of co-culture spheroids were captured using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) equipped with a high-resolution camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss).Robotic media exchange of co-culture spheroidsAfter forming spheroids, the cell culture medium in microwells was robotically exchanged to fresh medium containing only \u223c1% FBS. This was to ensure minimizing the effect of serum on cell growth and capture the effect of paracrine stromal-cancer cells signaling. The medium exchange was performed by three consecutive robotic dispensing and aspirating of 40 \u03bcl of the medium containing 1% FBS. This reduced the FBS concentration in the microwells from that of the complete growth medium to a very low level of \u223c1%. Therefore, the co-culture spheroids were maintained in \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of experiments. The medium exchange also diluted the PEG and DEX polymer concentrations and resulted in a single medium phase. The ATPS was not necessary at this point as it was only used for spheroid formation. The liquid handling protocol was optimized to avoid loss of spheroids during the process of medium exchange. Following this step, spheroids remained in 70 \u03bcl of homogenous \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of culture and without any further medium exchange.Evaluation of metabolic activity of co-culture spheroidsThe growth of co-culture spheroids was evaluated for a six-day period for all eight co-culture models using a standard PrestoBlue metabolic activity assay (Invitrogen). The PrestoBlue reagent contains a resazurin compound that is reduced by metabolically active, viable cells to resorufin detectable with standard plate readers at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. We have previously optimized the PrestoBlue assay for use with spheroid cultures. The resulting raw fluorescence data from all eight co-culture spheroids were normalized to the highest fluorescent readout obtained in the experimental data over the six-day period. Data from replicates (n = 14) of each co-culture model were then averaged and statistically evaluated to select certain co-culture models for further studies.Statistical analysis of growth of co-culture spheroidsStatistical analysis was performed on the metabolic activity of co-culture models using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Briefly, the data represented measured signals from eight different co-culture models over six days. For each model on each day, there were 14 experimental replicates that were repeatedly used over the six-day measurement period. Therefore, we selected one-way MANOVA for data analysis to account for the temporal dependency of the daily measurements with each spheroid from a given co-culture model. The data were tested in two steps: (i) to evaluate if a co-culture model was statistically different from the other models. This was done by testing the null hypothesis that none of the co-cultures was different from the other models; and (ii) to identify if the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was statistically different from the other seven models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs). This was done using seven pairwise comparisons to test the null hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model was not different from the other models.The first statistical test showed significant differences among the eight co-culture models. Next, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was selected for pairwise comparisons with the other seven models due to its higher levels of proliferation. We determined if greater proliferation in this model was statistically significant from the other co-cultures. The Bonferroni correction was utilized to control the family-wise error since this was a multiple testing problem. A significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 was selected to determine significant differences between the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and every other co-culture model. But \u03b1 was first modified to \u03b1/m, where m accounts for the number of hypotheses made. In this analysis, the number of hypotheses was m = 7. Therefore, a corrected significance level of 0.007 was used to reject the hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was not different from all the other seven co-cultures.For experiments that contained only two or three co-culture models presented in other sections, a student\u2019s t-test in Microsoft Excel Software or two-way ANOVA in Minitab Software was utilized with a p < 0.05 representing statistical significance.Blocking and stimulating chemokine-receptor signaling in co-culture spheroidsTo further evaluate cell proliferation due to chemokine-receptor signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids, AMD3100 (Selleckchem) was used to block the signaling and CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium was used to stimulate the signaling. A stock solution of AMD3100 was prepared in distilled, sterile water at 5 mM and stored at \u201380\u00b0C according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The desired concentration of AMD3100 was prepared by serially diluting the stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After formation of spheroids in the PEG-DEX ATPS, the medium exchange was done by adding 40 \u03bcl of AMD3100 at a 1.75 \u03bcM concentration to wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of medium. This diluted AMD3100 concentration to 1 \u03bcM. The AMD3100 solution was renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh solution of AMD3100 at a 1 \u03bcM concentration.To induce signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids, the spheroids were treated with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium collected from a confluent monolayer of CAFs. The conditioned medium was extracted from the CAFs monolayer 24 hours after seeding to ensure that it contained high levels of nutrients and growth factors. The conditioned medium was added to co-culture spheroids through medium exchange and renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh conditioned medium. Metabolic activity of co-culture spheroids following inhibition (AMD3100 treatment) or stimulation (CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium treatment) was evaluated daily using PrestoBlue over the six-day culture period. Data were compared to the respective negative controls, i.e., co-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF for inhibition and CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs for stimulation) that were grown in 70 \u03bcl of 1% FBS-containing media without receiving any treatment. Daily measured raw data from the co-culture models over the six-day culture were normalized to the highest fluorescent value obtained and then used for statistical tests.TNBC cell growth in co-culture spheroidsThe growth of TNBC cells in the co-culture models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs) that were selected based on the metabolic activity analysis was further confirmed by measuring the endogenous eGFP in TNBC cells using a plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The results were compared to those of the monoculture spheroids (TNBC and CXCR4+TNBC). Each model had n = 14 replicates. Data from each model were normalized to an arbitrary fluorescent value of 8000 a.u. for ease of comparison among different groups. Background fluorescence from the mCherry-expressing stromal cells in the co-culture spheroids was subtracted from the measured signal of TNBC cells. Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (Fluoview, FV1000, Olympus).Immunostaining and quantification of proliferation of co-culture spheroidsTo validate and quantify cell proliferation of co-culture spheroids, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an established protocol. Co-culture spheroids were aspirated from microwells on day four and collected in 200 \u03bcl microcentrifuge tubes. Medium used for transferring spheroids was carefully removed from the microcentrifuge tubes and 100 \u03bcl of 4% formaldehyde was added to fix the spheroids for 10 minutes at room temperature. The spheroids were rinsed with 100 \u03bcl of PBS three times for 5 minutes to remove the formaldehyde. A 30% (w/v) sucrose solution was then added to remove water from spheroids and prevent crystal formation upon freezing. Once spheroids sank to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes, an equal volume (100 \u03bcl) of tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences) was added to each tube. Samples were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight. Frozen samples were prepared the following day by flash-freezing spheroids into biopsy-sized cryomolds with dry ice. The spheroids were embedded between two thin layers of tissue freezing medium while avoiding bubble formation. The frozen molds containing the spheroids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.A cryostat (Leica CM 1850) was used to cryosection the spheroids to 10 \u03bcm-thick slices. Only the middle sections of spheroids were collected and assessed. Each slice was transferred onto Superfrost Plus microscopic slides (Fisher). The sections were stained using a standard immunostaining protocol with primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling including the proliferative cell marker Ki-67, phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan). A blue fluorescent secondary antibody (AMCA-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for detection to avoid interfering with the endogenous mCherry and eGFP signals in the stromal and TNBC cells, respectively. The endogenous eGFP fluorescence of TNBC cells was used to distinguish TNBC and stromal cells. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) was used to capture fluorescent images. Image processing and analysis were performed in ImageJ Software (NIH) to quantify expression of each blue-labeled protein. The TNBC cells of sections were found through binary conversion of the green channel images to select and outline only the eGFP-expressing TNBC cells. This TNBC cell outline was then overlaid on the blue channel images to measure the mean gray value of protein-expressing TNBC cells. For Ki-67 analysis, this value was then subtracted from the total mean gray value of blue channel images to determine the mean gray value of Ki-67+ stromal cells.Western blot analysis with spheroidsCo-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF) were harvested from microplates on day four and transferred into 50 mL conical tubes. After centrifuging down the samples, the supernatant was removed and spheroids were washed with PBS. Spheroids were lysed using 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer (50 mM tric-HCL, 150 mM NaCl 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4 \u00b1 0.2), a protease inhibitor (complete mini, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). Spheroids were sonicated (Vibra-Cell, Sonics) twice for five seconds at a 50% amplitude level to ensure complete lysis. A BCA quantification assay kit (Life Technologies) was then used to quantify the total protein concentration extracted from spheroids. Electrophoresis and electroblotting were performed by protein addition (20 \u03bcl) onto a 4\u201315% gel (Biorad) and then gel transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling for phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan) were prepared at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, and incubated with membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. The membranes were thoroughly washed prior to and following secondary antibody treatment and detected with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) using a FluorChem E imaging system (ProteinSimple). Quantified protein expression data were normalized to their corresponding \u03b2-actin expression.Chemotherapy drug testing with co-culture spheroidsBoth CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids were subjected to (i) single treatment with a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel (Selleckchem), and (ii) co-treatment with paclitaxel and AMD3100, to evaluate drug responses of TNBC cells. A stock solution of paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a 23 mM concentration and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. For single drug treatment, paclitaxel drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 2X the desired concentration. The drug solutions were added to co-culture spheroids, resulting in a total media volume of 70 \u03bcl and diluting the drug concentration in half. For co-treatment of spheroids with paclitaxel and AMD3100, drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 3.5X the desired concentration and directly added (20 \u03bcl of each drug solution) to co-culture spheroids in wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of media. Paclitaxel was added at a wide range of concentrations (0.01 \u2013 1000 nM) while AMD3100 was used at a constant 1 \u03bcM concentration for co-treatments. Single-agent (paclitaxel) and co-treatment (paclitaxel and AMD3100) tests were conducted for six days. A small volume (5 \u03bcl) of concentrated AMD3100 (15 \u03bcM) was directly added to the co-treated spheroid cultures after 72 hrs of incubation to provide a fresh dose of 1 \u03bcM AMD3100. Each condition in drug treatment studies used 14 spheroids. After six days, the TNBC cell viability of drug treated co-culture spheroids was evaluated using their endogenous eGFP fluorescence. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to the respective negative control conditions (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability.Preparation of inhibitors and testing against co-culture spheroidsThe CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and CXCR4+TNBC: CAFs spheroids were treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (Selleckchem), and a PI3K inhibitor, PI-103 (Selleckchem). Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared at a 50 mM concentration in DMSO and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. The desired inhibitor concentrations for experiments were prepared by serially diluting each stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After forming co-culture spheroids, the medium exchange was performed as previously described and 30 \u03bcl of an inhibitor solution (prepared at 2X desired concentration) was added to spheroids in the last renewal stage, diluting the inhibitor concentrations in half. A column of spheroids was left untreated and only received 30 \u03bcl of fresh 1% FBS-containing medium. Spheroids were incubated for 72 hrs and then treatments were renewed by direct addition of 30 \u03bcl of fresh inhibitor solutions (prepared at 1X desired concentration). The negative control conditions received 1% FBS-containing medium. The spheroids were incubated for an additional 48 hrs and viable TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids were detected using their endogenous eGFP with a plate reader. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to their respective negative controls (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability. The results obtained from plate reading were further confirmed by fluorescent microscopy (Axio Observer, Zeiss) followed by image analysis (ImageJ, NIH).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND

Tumor microenvironment is a whole system which includes tumor cells, stroma cells (such as, adipocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, infiltrating immune cells) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the activated fibroblasts, which were named by Tlsty\u2019s group in the tissue of prostatic cancer in 1999, are the primary type of host cells in the tumor microenvironment. CAFs were found in almost all solid tumor tissue (e.g. cancers of the colon, lung, liver, prostate, pancreas and gastric cancer), and play an assignable role in tumor development by cell-cell interaction or cross-talk with tumor cells through secreting growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, CAFs are thought to be \u201cthe dark side of coin\u201d in tumor development.In contrast to normal fibroblasts, CAFs have some of phenotypical and functional abnormality. These alterations of CAFs may be due to its stable gene expression changes. So, whole breast carcinomas stromal by microdissection were explored to analyze the gene expression profiling. These studies have led to new classifications and risk stratification of breast carcinomas into several molecular subtypes based on their gene expression signatures. The global gene expression in the stromal cells has also been shown to powerfully predict prognosis and treatment response. A variety of differences have been identified between breast carcinoma-associated stroma and its paired normal mammary stroma, primarily resulting in increased expression of cytokines (EGF, HGF PDGF, TLL-12, SSP-1, POSTN, CXCL-12, and CXCL14), extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (FBN1, FB2M, SPARC, ADRA2A and ADM) and proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-13). These factors were involved in cross-talk between stromal cells and tumor cells by directly or indirectly pattern to promote tumor cell proliferation, cell adhesion and invasion, ECM remodeling. Although, these studies give us the overall configuration of the tumor microenvironment, there are still poor on the role of each member in the tumor stroma, like CAFs, to contribute to the tumor development.Until most recently, the distinguishable features and gene expression profile of CAFs and NFs have been described in breast cancer by Bauer et al.. Their studies show that up-regulated WISP1, collagen type-X (COL10A) and TGF-\u03b2 isoforms in CAFs activate paracrine Wnt-1 signaling in human breast cancer cells or lead to abnormal ECM production in stroma separately. Loss of expression of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 may alter the hormonal milieu in breast carcinomas, and down-regulation of KLF4 participates in the differentiation of resting fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. However, there is still no systematic analysis of the intrinsic relationship between breast cancer CAFs function and its abnormal signaling pathway. The extreme complexity of breast cancer CAFs feature and its roles to tumor development are needed to be further investigated. Furthermore, whether these previous finding in CAFs derived from western country women are also existed in patients of other races.In light of these facts, the principal purpose of this work is to investigate the possible innate nature of biological and genetic heterogeneity between human breast CAFs versus matched NFs in Chinese women. We identified 824 differentially expressed genes: 809 of these were up-regulated, and 15 were down-regulated in CAFs, which included 8 cytokines. The abnormality of CAFs genes and its associated signaling pathways could be involved in cell cycle, cell adhesion, signal transduction and protein transport, which were proved in CAFs of other tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we firstly discovered that the altered ATM signaling pathway, which was recently found related to reactive oxidative stress (ROS), is abnormally activation in the early stage of breast cancer. Cell cycle regulated signaling, such as P53 signaling pathway, RB tumor suppressor/checkpoint signaling, regulation of cell cycle progression by Plk3, Cdc25 and Chk1 regulatory pathway are identified to be changed in CAFs. A set of immune associated signaling are abnormality in CAFs, which include natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules. And more importantly, we found that CAFs would be able to promote breast cancer cell invasion under co-culture condition through up-regulated CCL18.Materials and MethodsTissue SamplesAll the human breast tumor tissues and its adjacent normal mammary tissues were collected at the time of surgical reaction at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients received adjuvant therapy before surgery. Specimens used in this study were approved by the Ethics committees of Chongqing Medical University.Isolation and Culture of Primary FibroblastsTumor tissue and paired normal mammary tissues were washed 3 times with sterile PBS with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin and 50 \u00b5g/ml gentamycin). The tissues were minced with sterile scissors in a fresh sterile culture dish. After digestion with 0.1% collagenase type I (C0130, Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) at 37\u00b0C for 8\u201312 h, tissues were carefully pipetted up and down for a couple of times using culture medium. The mixtures were centrifuged and washed with DMEM to remove the fat and tissue debris. Then, the mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Australia) for about two days. Removed the suspending cells or tissue, the most adherent cells were fibroblasts. The primary fibroblasts isolated from tumor tissues were named \u201cCAFs\u201d, and from tumor paired normal tissues named \u201cNFs\u201d. Cell purity was identified by immunohistochemistry for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence staining for Fibronection, \u03b1-SMA and FAP following the standard described process previously and manufacture\u2019s protocols. Briefly, cells were grown on cover slips for 24 hours and fixed within 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with 0.1% triton-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (1\u2236150) for targeting fibronectin (F3648, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), \u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam Cambridge) and FAP (ab53066, Abcam Cambridge, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA) at 4\u00b0C for overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were then stained with a FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1\u2236100, ZF-0311, Zhongshan Goldenbrdge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and DAPI. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse 80 i microscope (Eclipse 80 i, Tokyo, Japan; magnification\u00d7100).MTT and Flow Cytometric AnalysisCell growth was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Cells were plated into 96-well plate at 5\u00d7103 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l of complete growth medium. Cell growth was measured every day. Incubating for the designed time, MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h. After careful removal of the medium, 0.1 ml of isopropanol with 0.04 N of HCl was added to each well, and the plates were shaken on a rotator for 20 min at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader at a wavelength of 570 nm. The independent experiments were repeated for five times.S-phase was analyzed by using laser scanning cytometry. Cells were processed by standard methods using propidium iodide staining of cell DNA as previously described. A minimum of 20,000 events was collected to maximize the statistical validity of the compartmental analysis. Triplicate independent experiments were done.Preparation of Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 cells, CAFs and NFs were cultured in complete growth DMEM for 48 h to approximately 80% confluence. The medium was changed to 0.5% FBS DMEM and cells were kept in culture for another 30 to 36 h. For neutralization experiments, neutralizing antibodies against human CXCL-12 (500 ng/ml), CCL18 (10 \u00b5g/ml), CCL4 (1.5 \u00b5g/ml) and control IgG (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were separately preincubated at 37\u00b0C with supernatant for 1 h before performing migration assays. The medium was centrifuged at 1,200\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM).Cell Migration and Invasion AssayCell invasion or migration assay was measured via modified Boyden chamber assay as described previously. Briefly, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200 \u00b5l serum-free medium were seeded in the wells of 8 \u00b5m-pore membrance modified Boyden chambers (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) coated with ECM (1\u22367.5) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). 10% FBS Medium, CM, CM with secreting factor CXCL-12 (100 nM), CCL18 (500 ng/ml) or CCL4 (100 nM) was separately added into the lower or upper chamber as the designed purpose. After 6 h or 12 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C and CO2 at 5%, cells adhered to the upper surface of the filter were removed using a cotton applicator. Stained with hematoxylin in methanol, the invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were counted. The data represent at least three experiments done in triplicate (mean\u00b1standard error).RNA Isolation, Quantitative Real-time PCR and Microarray AnalysisTotal RNA isolated from six paired CAFs and NFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA quantity was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and by spectrophotometry. Probe synthesis and hybridization performed as the manufacture\u2019s instruction were used to probe the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (44 K; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Data were generated after scanning by using an Agilent Scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and extracted using Agilent Feature Extraction Software v9.5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The raw data were normalized using quantize normalization and then analyzed by GeneSpring GX v10.0 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Paired Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) was applied to identify differentially expressed mRNA in CAFs and NFs. SAM output was filtered by q\u200a=\u200a0.1. Heatmap.2 function (R v2.14.0, gplots package v2.9.0) was used to plot the scaled expression data of differentially expressed mRNAs.An additional two expression datasets (GSE20086 and GSE29270) on breast cancer associated fibroblasts were downloaded from the GEO website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The raw data of six matched CAFs and NFs in GSE20086 were normalized using the R package gcRMA, GCRMA normalized. The author\u2019s processed data of 15 matched CAFs and NFs in GSE29270 were used in next analysis. Paired SAM were also used to analysis the different expression genes in CAFs versus NFs. In cytokines analysis process, the genes at least fold change >1.5 with an estimated FDR<10% were considered as dysregulated genes.RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). To confirm the differential gene expression pattern revealed by microarray analysis, 9 of randomly selected genes (CDC6, FLI1, S100A9, CDK1, PLK1, MMP9, PECAM1, SHC2 and C9ORF135) were re-proved by qRT-PCR assay. Specific Real-time PCR primers for each of selected genes were listed as Table 1. qRT-PCR was performed by a Bio-Rad CFX Manager instrument (Applied Biosystems) at 94\u00b0C for 15 Sec, Tm\u00b0C for 20 Sec and at 65\u00b0C for 30 Sec using SYBR Premix Ex Taq TM II (Takara, Dalian, China). GAPDH were used as internal control for normalizing different samples.Primer sequences for qRT-PCR.Gene\tForward 5\u2018\u20133'\tReverse 5\u2018\u20133'\tSize (bp)\t \tFN\tAACTTCCTGGTGCGTTACTCA\tTGTGCTCTCATGTTGTTCGT\t156\t \t\u03b1-SMA\tGAGGCACCCCTGAACCCCAA\tATCTCCAGAGTCCAGCACGA\t153\t \tFAP\tTGTTCCAGCAATGATAGCC\tCTGCTTTCTTCTATATGCTCC\t186\t \tCDC6\tCCAGGCACAGGCTACAATCAGT\tACACGAGGAGAACAGGTTACGG\t126\t \tS100A9\tGCACCCAGACACCCTGAACC\tACCCTCGTGCATCTTCTCGT\t211\t \tFLI1\tCCACCCTCTACAACACGGAA\tATGTTATTGCCCCAAGCTC\t166\t \tCDK1\tGGATCTACCATACCCATTGAC\tTGGCTACCACTTGACCTGT\t120\t \tPLK1\tAATTACATAGCTCCCGAGGTG\tAGCCAGAAGTAAAGAACTCGTC\t118\t \tMMP9\tTCCCTGGAGACCTGAGAACC\tGGCAAGTCTTCCGAGTAGTTT\t307\t \tPECAM1\tACTCAAATGATCCTGCGGTA\tACTTAACATTTTGGCATGGGA\t98\t \tSHC2\tGCACCTGTATGTCAACACCCA\tTCCTCAAAGGGTCGCATGTCA\t90\t \tC9ORF135\tTCCCATGGATAGCCTTGACA\tGTGCCAGGAATACACCAAC\t160\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \tCCL18\tCCGCCTCGTCTATACCTCC\tCACTTCTTATTGGGGTCAGC\t141\t \tCCL4\tTTCCTCGCAACTTTGTGGTA\tCAGGTCATACACGTACTCC\t140\t \tCXCL12\tCAGAGCCAACGTCAAGCATC\tATCCACTTTAGCTTCGGGTC\t117\t \t\nNote: FN, Fibronectin; \u03b1-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; FAP, fibroblast activation protein; CDC6, cell division cycle 6 homolog; S100A9, S100 calcium binding protein A9; FLI1, Friend leukemia virus integration 1; CDK1, cyclin-dependent kinase 1; PLK1, polo-like kinase 1; MMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; PECAM1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule; SHC2, SHC transforming protein 2; C9ORF135, chromosome 9 open reading frame 135; CXCL12, chemokine ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1);CCL18, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18; CCL4, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4.ELISA AssaySupernatant from NFs or CAFs were harvested and subjected to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for measuring the immunoreactive levels of CXCL-12, CCL18 and CCL4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the instructions as supplied by the manufacturer. The ELISA assay was carried out in duplicate in three separate experiments.Gene Ontology and Pathway AnalysisFor detection of significantly over-represented GO biological processes, the Onto-Express analysis tool was used and the permutated P-value cut-off was set below 0.05. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs was conducted through the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool and the significantly changed signaling pathways were selected based on P<0.01.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was done using SPSS standard version 13.0 software. Data was shown as means \u00b1 SD from at least three independent determinations. Significance of difference was analyzed using two-tailed Student\u2019s t tests. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant differences.ResultsIsolation and Identification of CAFs and NFsCAFs and their paired NFs were successfully isolated from six primary breast carcinomas and from adjacent normal breast tissue. The primary fibroblasts were successfully cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Both CAFs and NFs could be grown for at least 10 passages. Both CAFs and NFs showed spindle-like morphology (Fig. 1A). But the senescence-like cell would be appeared when the cell culture was more than 6 passages (Data not shown).Characterization of fibroblasts isolated from human breast tissue samples.A. Representative cell morphology of CAFs and NFs. B. Identification of CAFs using fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, and CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP by immunofluorescence staining. C. The biomarker gene expression in CAFs and NFs was re-proved by qTR-PCR, and its relative fold change in CAFs and NFs was displayed. The CAFs and NFs are positive for fibroblast biomarker fibronectin, CAFs specific biomarker \u03b1-SMA and FAP are high expression in CAFs (magnification 100\u00d7 (cell morphology); 200\u00d7 (Biomarker immunofluorescence staining).The purity of CAFs was identified by fibronectin, which is the fibroblast biomarkers, and CAFs-specific biomarkers including \u03b1-SMA and FAP, respectively. NF and CAFs were positive for fibronectin, more than 95% of CAFs were stained by \u03b1-SMA and FAP (Fig. 1B). These biomarker expression changes were reproved by qRT-PCR in 3 paired of CAFs and NF (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrated that the purified CAFs were isolated from tumor tissue.The Noticeable Heterogeneity of Proliferation, Migration and Invasion between CAFs and NFsThe cell growth assay revealed that CAFs were endowed a significantly growth rate than that of NFs in the same culture conditions (P<0.05; Fig. 2A). The percentage of cells in the S phases measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in CAFs (33.3\u00b17.1, N>3) compared with NFs (6.6\u00b12.5, N>3) (P<0.05). These data suggested that CAFs had a stronger capacity for proliferation than their paired NFs (Fig. 2B\u2013C). Similarly, CAFs had strong potent ability of migration (Fig. 3A\u2013B) and invasion (Fig. 3C) than its paired NFs.Significant difference of proliferation between CAFs and NFs.A. Cell proliferation determined by MTT assay for three of CAFs and NFs. B. Representative DNA content of CAFs and NFs were tested by flow cytometry. C. The percentages of cells in each of cell cycle phases shown by histogram for CAFs vs. NFs. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u22653 separate experiments (**P<0.01).The migration and invasion of CAFs compared with NFs.A. Cell migration capability was determined by wound healing assay. B. The distance of wound closure (compared with control at 0 h) was measured in four-independent wound sites each group after 24 h. C. The invasion capability of CAFs and NFs was determined by Transwell assay. D. The migrated cells of CAFs and NFs shown by a histogram. Data were shown as mean\u00b1SD of 5 repeats. (**P<0.01), (magnification A. 100\u00d7; C. 200\u00d7).CAFs Stimulate Tumor Cell Growth, Migration and InvasionIn order to understand the interaction cross-talk of CAFs with tumor cells in the tumor microenvironment, co-culture system was employed to display their role in the cell proliferation and invasion. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from NFs (NFs CM) and control, MDA-MB-231 cultured in CM derived from CAFs (CAFs CM) had significant proliferation (P<0.05; Fig. 4A) assayed by cell growth curve. The proportion of MDA-MB-231 cells in the DNA synthesis (S) phase cultured in CAFs CM (29.8\u00b10.8, N\u200a=\u200a3) was obviously more than that in NFs CM (13.0\u00b12.2, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.01) and control (23.5\u00b11.4, N\u200a=\u200a3; P<0.05) (Fig. 4B\u2013C). Collectively these studies demonstrate that CAFs had a stronger capacity promoting tumor cell proliferation than their paired NFs in the breast tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the increasing cell invasion was found in the co-culture system of MDA-MB-231 cells with CAFs CM, as compared with the system containing NFs CM or control medium (Fig. 5A\u2013D).CAFs promote proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells in co-culture system compared with NFs.A. Cell growth curve determined by cell count. B. Representative DNA content of MDA-MB-231 cultured with normal medium and with conditioned medium derived from CAFs and NFs determined by flow cytometry. C. The percentages of cells in each of cell cycle phases shown by histogram for MDA-MB-231. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for 3 separate experiments (*P<0.05; **P<0.01).The potential interaction of CAFs and tumor cells on cell invasion.A, C. MDA-MB-231 invasion ability was tested by Transwell assay cultured in the medium with FBS or FBS free (A), and migrated cells were shown by histogram (C). B, D. The migrated MDA-MB-231 cells were checked by Transwell assay (B) in the co-culture system using condition medium derived from CAFs and NFs. And (D) the migrated cells shown by histogram. E, F. The invasive potential of CAFs and NFs were determined by Transwell assay (E) in the co-culture system using condition medium derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. The histogram to show the average migrated cells each view (F). Data is representative of 5 views (**P<0.01), (magnification: A, B 100\u00d7; E 200\u00d7).To examine whether tumor cells play a role in the biologic behavior of fibroblasts in the stroma, the effect of MDA-MB-231 on the migration of CAFs and NFs was compared. As predicted, more migrated cells were tested in the co-culture of CAFs and CM from MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5E\u2013F). These data indicated that different effects existed in the cross-talk of tumor cells and fibroblasts.Genes Differentially Expressed between CAFs and NFsTo reveal the essence of the heterogeneity of biologic characteristic between CAFs and NFs in the breast carcinoma microenvironment, gene expression profile was investigated by micro-array assay. Total RNA derived from six paired CAFs and NFs isolated from primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinomas of grade \u0399\u0399 were used in this analysis. Gene expression profiles of pooled CAFs and their pooled normal counterparts were obtained by microarray analysis using the Agilent Human Whole Genome Oligonucleotide Microarray (Fig. 6A). A total of 25,206 probe sets (transcripts) were present in human breast carcinomas-derived fibroblasts relative to their normal controls. Compared with the expression profile of NFs, 809 up-regulated genes (0.9%) and only 15 down-regulated genes (0.45%) were detected in CAFs using an arbitrary cutoff line of signal log ratio of \u22651.8 or \u2264\u22121.8. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), cell division cycle 6 homolog (CDC6); Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (FLI1); S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), matrix metallo peptidase 9 (MMP9), and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) were predominantly over-expressed at high levels in CAFs whereas SHC transforming protein 2 (SHC2) and chromosome 9 open reading frame 135 (C9ORF135) were down-regulated with a high array intensity (Table S1 and Table S2).Gene heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs.A. HeatMap of gene expression data obtained by Agilent micro-arrays analysis from CAF and NF isolated from all six cases (BCa 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were subjected to unsupervised cluster analysis. B. The mRNA levels of 9 genes selected randomly were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C. Signaling pathway analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathway in CAFs vs. NFs.The up-regulated genes encoded for secreted proteins were mostly classified into groups of extracellular region, cell proliferation, and signal transducer activity (Table S3). To validate the microarray data, the expression level of 9 randomly selected genes including 7 of up-regulated genes and 2 of down-regulated genes were re-proved by qRT-PCR between CAFs and NFs (Fig. 6B). Compared with NFs, the expression pattern of all differentially expressed genes in CAFs detected by qRT-PCR was consistent with the microarray results.The Unanimity Heterogeneity of Biological Characteristics and Genes Expressed in CAFsMicroarray assay displayed that most genes up-regulated in CAFs have oncogenic function, including growth factors (FGF2, VEGFC, PDGFC, CASC5, and HGFAC), transcription regulators (MKX, RUNX3, ATAD2, FOXM1, and PTTG1), cell proliferation-associated genes (CENPF, PLK1, BUB1, KIF15, and CRIP1) and members of the Wnt signal pathway (WNT1, WNT5A, LRP6, TCF4, and GBP4). Several genes encoding secreted proteins, such as CCL18, CXCL12, MCM10, ADAMDEC1, MMP9, and S100A9 were also significantly up-regulated in CAFs (Table S3). All of these secreted proteins are able to induce cell proliferation, implying that CAFs play a role in the proliferation of tumor cells.Additionally, microarray results suggest that CAFs may facilitate invasion and metastasis of breast tumor cells. The data listing in Table S1 shows that CAFs promote tumor cell invasion mainly via two of mechanisms: (a) altering tumor microenvironment interactions (tumor-stroma and tumor-tumor) by increasing cell adhesion (PECAM1, ITGAX, CCL4, LPP, and SIGLEC8) and cell-cell interaction signaling (CCL18, DLGAP5, C1QA, STAB1, and TEK), and (b) promoting extracellular region degradation (LYZ, C1QB, MMP9, IGLL1, and IGHG1) surrounding tumor cells (Table S3).Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis of enriched processes and signaling pathways showed that CAFs enriched many serviceable signaling pathways in contrast to NFs in human breast cancer. Maximum change pathways in CAFs were cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathways associated with cell cycle. Compared with NFs, the cell cycle and DNA replication signal pathway in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times, respectively. The alteration of the ATM signaling pathway was absolute significantly. It was recently reported that the ATM signaling was activated under oxidative stress. Our preliminary data indicated that activated ATM signaling was in responsible for cell proliferation of fibroblasts (Data not shown). The change of other pathways was also assignable, such as DNA replication signal pathways, chemokine signaling pathways, PI3k signaling pathways, abnormal activated p53 signaling pathway (Fig. 6C). Herein, the heterogeneity of genes expressed between CAFs and NFs was consistent with their heterogeneity of biological characteristics.The Common Cytokines-CCL18 Obtained by Compared with Published Microarray DataTo compare the shared genes in current work with previous publication in breast cancer CAFs, the mRNA microarray data of breast cancer CAFs and its paired NFs stored in National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE20086 and GSE29270) were used. As shown in Fig. 7, the dysregulated genes of CAFs are 136 (M Bauer), 1339 (M Basik), and 1102 in current work, respectively. The shared dysregulated genes among each of these data were 12 (Bauer\u2019s data vs. Basik\u2019s data), 7 (Local data vs. Bauer\u2019s data), and 93 (Local data vs. Basik\u2019s data). These data indicate that high heterogeneity is indeed existed in the CAFs of breast cancer. The similarity was found for cytokines and chemokines genes in the CAFs. The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained in comparing the current data with Basik\u2019s microarray data.The common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained by compared with published microarray data.The number of dysregulated difference genes and shared genes from current work and two other studies in breast cancer associated CAF versus paired NF was displayed in each group. Dysregulated Cytokines in each study were listed. Only the common cytokines-CCL18 was obtained compared local data with Basik\u2019s microarray data (GSE29270).CAFs Provide a Suitable Microenvironment for Tumor Cell InvasionImmune-related genes, including various chemokines (CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18), are also differentially expressed in CAFs (Fig. 6C and 8A). Chemokines secreted by stromal cells surrounding tumor tissue have been associated with tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis through cross-talk between tumor and stromal cells. To understand whether CXCL12, CCL4 and CCL18 involving in the cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells, tumor cell invasion was analyzed in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231, or NFs and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 8B and 8D, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 immunoneutralizing antibody in the co-culture system of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 reduced tumor cell invasion by nearly 60%. However, Condition medium (CM) with neutralizing antibody CCL4 had no significantly affect on tumor cell invasion. On the other hand, the addition of CXCL12 or CCL18 ligand, not CCL4 ligand in the co-culture system of NFs and MDA-MB-231 enhanced transmigration of tumor cells by around 3-fold (Fig. 8C and 8E). Collectively, these studies indicate that the up-regulated chemokine genes in CAFs have contributed to suitable microenvironments for tumor cell invasion.CCL18 and CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promote tumor cell invasion in cross-talk between CAFs and tumor cells.A. The mRNA levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by qRT-PCR in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. B. The protein expression levels of CXCL12, CCL18 and CCL4 were analyzed by ELISA in CAF and NF from 3 patients with breast cancer. The data were shown as fold change in CAF vs. NF. C-F. Transwell migration assays were used to determine the functional significance of cytokines secreted by CAFs on tumor invasion. Assays were conducted by using either immunoneutralizing antibody (C and E) or addition of ligands (D and F) in the co-culture system. The data were shown as mean\u00b1SD for N\u200a=\u200a3 separate experiments (**P<0.01), (magnification 100\u00d7).DiscussionCancer-associated fibroblasts have been recognized for their impact on the carcinogenesis, promotion and progression of many carcinomas. Breast cancer is notoriously associated with tumor microenvironment stroma with activated fibroblasts. However, relatively little is known about the relationship of biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and NFs in the stroma of human breast carcinoma. Herein, this study focused on the gene expression profile of human breast cancer-derived fibroblasts in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of how fibroblasts induce a favorable microenvironment to cancer development.CAFs had several pivotal biological characteristics compared with NFs in human breast cancer. Using the CAFs and its paired NFs isolated from breast cancer tissue, the proliferation, migration and invasion of CAFs themselves were memorably higher than that of NFs in breast cancer. And CAFs had the potential capacity for the proliferation and invasion of tumor cells. Furthermore, the invasion ability of CAFs and breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 could significantly be increased under the co-culture system of tumor cells and CAFs or NFs cells.In line with the finding of the biological difference between CAFs and NFs, the heterogeneity of genes expression profiles and signal pathways were highly consistent with the biological characteristics of CAFs and NFs. The huge heterogeneity of gene expression was found between CAFs and NFs (Table S1 and S2). For example, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cancer susceptibility candidate 5 (CASC5) took part in the regulating proliferation of CAF itself and tumor cell.Compared with NFs, over-expressed genes in CAFs afford several interesting insights into the dynamics of the carcinoma microenvironment through the special GO Catalogue. The gene ontology and signaling pathway analysis showed that the cell cycle and cell cycle regulated signaling pathways in CAFs were strong activated for 4 and 6 times respectively, compared with NFs. Traditionally, p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were cancer suppressor gene, but p53 signaling pathway abnormal activated and over-expressed of BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATR in CAFs may involve in other function in the tumor microenvironment. Similarly, ATM signaling pathway and cdc25 and chk1 regulatory pathway may be related to cell proliferation in response to oxidative stress, although they were in responds to DNA damage or DNA strand break in traditionally. These data demonstrated that the vigorous proliferation of CAFs than NFs by some special activated signal pathway. However, the details will be further study for our next work.Moreover, the different invasion capacity between CAFs and NFs may be supported by other sets of genes expression (e.g. FOXM1, MMP9, PTTG1, IGHG1, TM4SF19, S100A9, SDCBP) in the CAFs and NFs. Heterogeneity of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) were involved in cancer invasion and migration. In breast cancer, the securin protein stability of PTTG1 was correlated with securin accumulation. Immunoglobulin heavy constant gamma 1 (IGHG1) and transmembrane 4 L six family member 19 (TM4SF19) were related to tumor immune invasion mechanisms and then made the tumor cells immunity. S100 calcium binding protein A9 (S100A9) has been revealed as the metastasis-inducing protein. Syndecan binding protein (SDCBP) was reported involving in cancer metastatic progression. These results support the function of fibroblasts in breast carcinoma to promote cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis.Furthermore, CAFs recruited numerous cells related with tumor angiogenesis, infiltration, which promoted the tumor invasion and metastasis, through secreted some special chemical chemotactic factors. For example, CXCL14 derived from CAFs in prostate cancer and SDF1/CXCL12 derived from CAFs in breast cancer called up macrophages, endothelial cells derived from bone marrow source, M2 mononuclear cells to the tumor tissue respectively, which assisted the tumor formation new blood and lymph vessels. Chemokine signaling pathway and PI3k signaling pathways enriched in CAFs also illustrated that CAFs could promote itself and the cancer cell invasion and migration. These studies suggest that a close and frequent crosstalk between the CAFs and tumor cells exists during tumor invasion and metastasis process.In addition, a set of signaling associated with immune response, activation or immune escape were found in this study. For example, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, antigen processing and presentation, immune network for IgA production, Lck and Fyn tyrosine kinases in initiation of TCR Activation, B lymphocyte cell surface molecules are abnormality compared with NFs. Although, its roles in the microenvironment to promote tumorigenesis and/or development for breast carcinoma are keeping study, these finding in current work indicate that CAFs may involve in immune response and/or immune escape of tumor cell.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer associated fibroblasts: the dark side of the coinBreast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironmentBreast cancer\u2013one term, many entities?Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts promotes the proliferation of a lingual carcinoma cell line by secreting keratinocyte growth factorCancer-associated orthotopic myofibroblasts stimulates the motility of gastric carcinoma cellsRole of cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts in metastatic colon cancer to the liver and their expression profilesCasbas-Hernandez P, Fleming JM, Troester MA (2011) Gene Expression Analysis of In Vitro Cocultures to Study Interactions between Breast Epithelium and Stroma.

The evidence suggests that stromal signals resembling those of a distant organ select for cancer cells that are primed for metastasis in that organ, thus illuminating the evolution of metastatic traits in a primary tumor and its distant metastases.INTRODUCTIONA key question in understanding the origin of metastasis is how cancer cells in a primary tumor acquire the ability to colonize a particular distant organ. Primary tumors release large numbers of cancer cells into the circulation, yet only a small proportion of these cells survive the stress of invading distant organs and progress to metastases. Moreover, different tumor types metastasize with distinct patterns of organ preference. It was postulated that these metastatic traits are gained through random pro-metastatic mutations in primary tumors, and remain rare until selection in secondary organ sites leading to expansion of the mutant cell clones. In this model, the molecular determinants of metastasis would not be overtly manifest in the bulk cell population of a primary tumor. However, no driver mutations specific for metastasis to particular organs have been identified to date. Growing evidence shows, on the contrary, that the likelihood of metastasis in general, and of metastasis to certain organs in particular, can be predicted from gene expression patterns of primary tumors. These findings imply that pro-metastatic activities expressed in large segments of the primary tumor cell population increase the probability that the cancer cells will colonize particular organs.How organ-specific metastatic traits and their associated gene signatures emerge in primary tumors remains an enigma. A case in point is the specific association of breast cancer bone metastasis with a gene expression signature (Src response signature, SRS) that denotes activation of Src and Src-dependent enhancement of PI3K-Akt signaling in primary tumors. This association is particularly striking in the case of tumors that are triple-negative (TN) for ER, progesterone receptor, and ERBB2 amplification. As a group TN tumors have a strong propensity to metastasize in visceral organs, whereas SRS+ TN tumors additionally have a propensity to metastasize in bone. Although Src can regulate many aspects of cell behavior, its effect in models of breast cancer metastasis is to enhance the survival and incipient outgrowth of metastatic cells that enter the bone marrow, without affecting the rate of entry or the eventual engagement of osteoclasts for osteolytic metastasis. Src promotes the survival of breast cancer cells by amplifying the responsiveness of the PI3K-Akt survival pathway to CXCL12 and IGF1. These cytokines are present in the bone marrow stroma and are more highly expressed in the bone metastasis microenvironment than in other metastatic sites. Breast cancer cells that lodge in the bone marrow are more likely to survive in this environment if they possess Src-enhanced responsiveness to these stromal cytokines.Src hyperactivity however does not confer a net growth advantage in mammary tumors, nor is Src frequently mutated or genomically amplified in breast cancer. These observations raise questions about the mechanisms that lead to the accumulation of Src-hyperactive cells in breast tumors. We addressed these questions by considering two alternative hypotheses. Src hyperactivity in SRS+ breast cancer cells could be biochemically linked to the primary oncogenic alterations driving the tumor or, alternatively, it could result from clonal selection of a Src-dependent growth advantage that is not manifest in the primary tumor. Prior findings, which we confirmed, lent support to the first of these hypotheses in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast tumors and HER2+ breast tumors (tumors driven by the ERBB2 oncogene). However, our search for answers in the third major class of breast cancer, TN tumors, revealed a process of stroma-driven selection for clones that are primed for bone metastasis. This process is driven by CXCL12 and IFG1 from mesenchymal stromal cells and it selects for Src-hyperactive cancer cell clones that thrive in environments containing these signals. We delineate this process of metastasis seed preselection in experimental models and provide evidence for the existence of its defining traits in human breast tumors.RESULTSSrc Activation in Different Subtypes of Breast CancerTo determine what drives Src activation in primary tumors, we investigated the features associated with SRS+ status in different subtypes of breast cancer. Most ER+ breast tumors and at least half of HER2+ tumors score as SRS+ (Figures 1A, S1A, S1B). Mechanistically this is in line with the ability of Src to interact with ER and activate non-transcriptional tumorigenic signaling, and the capacity of Src and ERBB2/ERBB3 dimers for reciprocal activation. We confirmed these links with biochemical and pharmacologic approaches (Figures S1C-S1H). We concluded that Src activation, SRS+ status, and the propensity to metastasize in bone are intrinsically coupled to the oncogenic drivers in these breast cancer subtypes (Figure 1A, Table S1).Triple-negative (TN) breast tumors have a propensity to metastasize in visceral organs. However, a significant proportion of these patients develop metastasis to bone as the first site (Figure 1A, Table S1). SRS+ status in TN tumors is a strong prognostic indicator of bone relapse. Unlike the ER+ and HER2+ subtypes, TN tumors are driven by diverse oncogenic mutations. PIK3CA mutations are frequent in breast cancer. In the TCGA breast cancer cohort, comprising 409 primary tumor samples with matched mutation and expression data, 43% of SRS+ tumors harbor PIK3CA mutations, versus 32% of all tumors (p = 2.7e-5). Mutations in other PI3K pathway components such as PTEN did not correlate with SRS status (p = 0.51). Within TN tumors 16% had PIK3CA mutations, versus 36% in the SRS+ TN subset (p = 0.00027), suggesting a limited contribution of PIK3CA mutations to SRS+ status. Thus, SRS+ status represents an output of diverse upstream mechanisms in TN breast cancer.CAF Content of TN Tumors is Linked to Bone MetastasisSeeking additional clues for how Src activity accumulates in SRS+ TN tumors, we compared the gene expression profiles of SRS- and SRS+ TN tumors in independent clinical datasets, and focused on genes that are significantly enriched in SRS+ tumors but are not part of the SRS gene set itself (Figure 1B). Forty-three genes scored as SRS-associated genes, among which 38 were validated in the TCGA dataset (p < 0.001, FDR < 0.05, Figure 1B, Table S2). Notably, these genes included CXCL12, CXCL14, IGF1 and IGF2 (Figure 1C), which are also overexpressed in bone metastasis tissues compared to metastases in lung, liver or brain (Figure 1D). The enriched expression of these four cytokines in ER- tumors was especially pronounced in TN cases compared to HER2+ cases (Figure 1E). A two-gene classifier comprised of CXCL12 and IGF1 alone was also prognostic of bone metastasis (Figure 1F). These observations pointed at an intriguing resemblance in cytokine content between SRS+ TN tumors and the bone marrow where these tumors preferably metastasize.We sought to identify the source of these cytokines in SRS+ TN tumors. None of the TN breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 (MDA231 for short), CN34, BT549, MDA-MB-435 or MDA-MB-436 cells expressed high level of CXCL12, CXCL14, IGF1 or IGF2 (transcriptomic data not shown). To determine whether the association of SRS with CXCL12/14 and IGF1/2 in TN tumors reflects an abundance of a particular cell type, we applied gene-signature classifiers that designate specific breast tumor stromal cell types. These gene signatures were previously derived from purified cell populations from breast tumors of multiple patients, and therefore represent consensus profiles of specific stromal types from individually heterogeneous tumors. Notably, SRS+ status in TN tumors was associated with a high score for fibroblast and myofibroblast gene signatures but not leukocyte or myoepithelial gene signatures (Figure 2A). Indeed, tumor-associated mesenchymal cells (fibroblast and myofibroblast), also referred to as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), abundantly express CXCL12. In line with this, previous transcriptional datasets showed no CXCL12 expression and low expression of IGF1 in cancer cells compared to mesenchymal stroma.The CAF gene set and the SRS-associated gene set included CXCL12, CXCL14 and IGF1 (Figure 2B). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering by the combined mesenchymal stroma gene signature (CAF signature for brevity) identified a set of TN tumors comprising almost exclusively SRS+ cases (Figures 2C, S2A). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed this association (Figures 2D, S2B). Exclusion of tumors with PIK3CA mutations did not diminish the correlation between CAF+ status and SRS+ status (p=0.0031, versus p=0.004 for all tumors included). Importantly, the CAF signature score of TN breast tumors was tightly correlated with the content of stromal cells staining positive for the CAF marker alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) (Figures 2E, 2F). The SRS score was also associated with the abundance of \u03b1SMA+ stromal cells (Figure S2C). The CAF signature was overrepresented in bone metastases compared to metastases at other sites (Figure 2G). These results showed a concordance between CAF stromal content, CAF gene signature score, and CAF-derived cytokines in TN SRS+ tumors.Notably, both the CAF gene signature (Figures 2H, 2I) and CAF cell content in TN breast tumors (Figures S2D, S2E) were associated with bone relapse but not with lung relapse. Thus, by molecular and histological criteria, CAF-rich TN tumors were predisposed to metastasize in bone. CAF signature (p =0.027; hazard ratio 2.36, 95% CI: 1.24\u20134.47) and SRS (p =0.023; hazard ratio 7.11, 95% CI: 1.87\u201327.10) as continuous variables also correlated with bone relapse as the end-point. An association of the CAF signature with SRS+ status was also present though less pronounced in ER+ and HER2+ tumors (Figure S2F). Collectively, these results linked the CAF content with the propensity of TN tumors to relapse in bone.Premises for CXCL12 and IGF1 Driven SelectionThe repeated observation of an association between SRS status, CAF gene signature, CXCL12/IGF1 expression, and risk of bone metastasis, led us to consider the possibility of a selection process whereby stroma-derived CXCL12 and IGF1 in breast tumors skew cancer cell populations toward a preponderance of Src-hyperactive clones and thus, toward bone metastasis potential. This \u201cmetastasis seed pre-selection\u201d hypothesis required three premises: first, the presence of a selectable trait \u2013Src hyperactivity\u2013 in the cancer cells; second, a heterogeneous distribution of this trait in the cancer cell population; and third, the presence of limiting concentrations of CXCL12/IGF1 that would act as a selector of cell fitness to respond to these survival signals.To determine the clonal distribution of Src activity in a heterogeneous breast cancer cell population we analyzed the level of activated Src (Src phosphorylated at Tyr416, pY416-Src) in 100 clonal cell lines isolated from the MDA231 parental population. We quantitated the pY416- Src level in each clone by ELISA. The distribution of values varied over a 12-fold range (Figure 3A). These values remained stable over 25 population doublings in culture (data not shown). Thus, pY416-Src was a heterogeneously distributed, stable trait in the cancer cell population.To define CXCL12 and IGF1 as positive selectors, we determined the Akt response in cancer cells incubated with a range of CXCL12 and IGF1 concentrations (Figure S3A). Based on the sensitivity of Akt activation, we chose intermediate (30 ng/ml CXCL12, 10 ng/ml IGF1) or saturating (300 ng/ml CXCL12, 100 ng/ml IGF1) concentration of these factors and determined their combined effect on MDA231 by RNA-seq. The transcriptomic responses (fold change > 2, p < 0.05) to these two sets of concentrations showed some commonalities but also many differences (Table S3). Each set was qualitatively unique as determined by principal component analysis (Figure 3B). Of the two gene signatures, only that corresponding to the intermediate CXCL12/IGF1 concentration was enriched in CAF+ TN tumors, as determined by GSEA (Figure 3C). These results suggest that endogenous signals in CAF+ tumors elicit a response similar to that of cancer cells stimulated with limiting concentrations of CXCL12 and IGF1 in vitro.CXCL12 and IGF1 Select for Src-hyperactive Cancer CellsWith these premises established, we modeled CXCL12/IGF1\u2013driven selection by subjecting cancer cells to long-term culture in mitogen-poor media (0.2% fetal bovine serum) with or without supplementation with CXCL12 and IGF1 (Figure 3D). Without supplementation very few colonies developed. These background clones (MDA231-0 cells) were pooled and expanded in regular media. The level of pY416-Src in MDA231-0 cells was the same as in the parental MDA231 cells (Figure 3E). With CXCL12/IGF1 addition, more colonies grew (Figure S3B). After expansion in regular growth media, the resulting cell population (CXCL12/IGF1-selected MDA231 cells, MDA231-CI) showed a gain in pY416-Src as determined by immunoblotting (Figure 3E) and phospho-flow cytometry (Figure 3F). The level of pY416-Src in MDA231-CI cells matched the upper quartile of the parental MDA231 population (Figure 3A), and had a high SRS score (Figure 3G). Both parameters were stable over at least 25 population doublings in regular culture conditions without CXCL12 or IGF1 additions (data not shown).The gain in pY416-Src was verified by immunoprecipitation with Src-specific antibody followed by anti-pY416-Src immunoblotting (Figure S3C). Src was not activated by CXCL12 and IGF1 but it rather enhanced the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway by these cytokines, and this enhancement was inhibited by the broad spectrum Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib (Figure S3D). In MDA231-CI cells half-maximal activation of Akt occurred at lower concentrations of CXCL12 and IGF1 (Figure S3E). In sum, under restrictive growth conditions the presence of limiting concentrations of CXCL12 and IGF1 skewed the cancer cell population towards a preponderance of clones with an intrinsically high level of activated Src.CXCL12 and IGF1 Select for Bone Metastatic ClonesA prediction from the above findings is that breast cancer cells with a high level of pY416-Src have a particular survival advantage in the bone marrow because CXCL12 and IGF1 are relatively more abundant in this tissue than in other organ sites. Indeed, when inoculated into the arterial circulation of mice, the MDA231-CI cells were significantly more metastatic to bone compared to parental MDA231 and MDA231-0 cells (Figure 4A). Bone lesions formed by MDA231-CI typically affected femora and vertebrae (Figure 4B). MDA231-CI showed no gain in lung metastatic activity (Figures S4A, S4B). The lesions formed by MDA231-CI cells were mostly restricted to the bone marrow cavity, with little engagement of osteoclasts or bone matrix destruction, as compared to lesions formed by the aggressive bone metastatic derivative MDA231-BoM1833 (Figure 4C). In line with this result, MDA231-CI showed little or no gain in the expression of typical proosteolytic genes (Figure 4D). Thus, MDA231-CI cells spontaneously presented a survival and outgrowth advantage in the bone marrow prior to the onset of the osteolytic stage.Several lines of evidence supported the specificity of these effects. Src knockdown in MDA231-CI (Figures 4E, S4C, S4D) or administration of dasatinib two weeks after MDA231-CI inoculation (Figure 4F) inhibited bone metastases. Bone metastasis inhibition by dasatinib in MDA231 cells is specifically mediated by inhibition of Src in the cancer cells. No EGF family members were present in the SRS+ associated gene set or in the CAF signature, and MDA231 cell populations selected with EGF in low-serum media showed little gain in pY416-Src content (Figure S4E) or bone metastatic activity (Figures 4G, S4F).Cancer cell clones with high Src activity (Srchigh, refer to Figure 3A) showed an intrinsically high bone metastatic ability independently of osteolytic gene expression (Figures 4H, S4G, S4H), thus matching the phenotype of the CXCL12/IGF1-selected MDA231-CI population. To test whether Src-hyperactive cells show elevated bone metastatic ability from the orthotopic site, we labeled Srchigh cells with turbo-GFP, which generates a strong fluorescence signal that facilitates visualization of lesions. Nine weeks after mammary tumor implantation, no significant difference was observed in the size of primary tumors formed by Srchigh or Srclow cells (Figure S4I) or in the accumulation of cancer cells in the lungs (Figure S4J). Notably, Srchigh mammary tumors showed a much higher rate of spontaneous bone metastases compared to Srclow tumors (Figures 4I, 4J), and the proportion of GFP+ cancer cells in bone marrow aspirates subjected to flow cytometry (Figure S4K) was much higher in mice bearing Srchigh tumors (Figure 4K).CXCL12 and IGF1 Select for Clones that Persist in the Bone MarrowTo further characterize the phenotype selected by CXCL12 and IGF1 we applied the in vitro selection protocol to the CN34 model, which is more indolent than MDA231 and allows analysis of the latent metastasis state. Similar enrichment of Src-hyperactive clones was seen after long-term culture of CN34 cells in CXCL12/IGF1-supplemented media (Figures 5A, S5A). We determined the load of human cells in the bone marrow by quantitation of human \u03b22-microglobulin (B2M) mRNA levels (Figure 5B), which can detect as few as 10 human cancer cells in 5\u00d7106 mouse cells (Figure S5B). Eight weeks after inoculation of the cells into the arterial circulation of mice, the CXCL12/IGF1-selected CN34 cells (CN34-CI) had a superior ability to persist in the bone marrow (Figure 5C). Under experimental conditions that allow the incipient outgrowth of these cells in the marrow, administration of dasatinib suppressed the outgrowth (Figure 5D).Transcriptional Shift of Mammary Tumors Under a Mesenchymal StromaWe investigated whether supplementing experimental mammary tumors with mesenchymal cells would lead to the selection of Src-hyperactive cancer cells and a gain in bone metastatic activity. To this end, we used bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a source of mesenchymal stromal signals. MSCs express CXCL12, undergo CAF-like differentiation in response to cancer cell signals, and contribute to the stroma in primary tumors. In their basal state, MSCs secreted CXCL12 and, when stimulated with cancer cell-conditioned media, MSCs additionally secreted IGF1 (Figures S6A, S6B). In contrast, the breast cancer cells did not secrete CXCL12 or IGF1. Transcript levels for CXCL12 and IGF1 were in line with these results (Figure S6C).To assess whether MSC-supplementation would recapitulate the key features of human CAF+ breast tumors, we transcriptionally profiled cancer cells in MSC-supplemented experimental tumors in situ. This was achieved by engineering MDA231 cells to express a ribosomal protein L10a fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-L10a). The expressed EGFP-L10a is incorporated into the cancer cell ribosomes, allowing the specific retrieval of cancer cell transcripts from tumor lysates by polysome immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFP antibody (Figure 6A, translating ribosome affinity purification, TRAP). TRAP enables RNA-seq analysis of the cancer cell transcriptome from freshly excised tumors without intervening cell isolation steps that could confound the results.MDA231 cells expressing EGFP-L10a were implanted alone as a control, or MDA231 admixed with MSCs at a 1:1 ratio into the mammary fat pads of mice. RNA-seq analysis of the TRAP samples showed that tumor supplementation with MSCs caused a transcriptomic shift in the cancer cells that resembled the shift associated with CAF+ status in clinical tumor samples (Figures 6B, 6C). Consistently, MSC-supplemented tumors showed a 3- to 10-fold increase in the proportion of cells staining positive for the CAF marker \u03b1SMA (Figure 6D), and a higher level of CXCL12 and IGF1 immunostaining (Figures 6E, 6F). The TRAP RNA-seq data revealed no ribosome-associated CXCL12 or IGF1 transcripts in cancer cells (Figure S6D).The gene expression profile of cancer cells from MSC-supplemented tumors resembled the profile of MDA231 cells treated with limiting CXCL12 and IGF1 concentrations (Figure 6G). This similarity was further validated by Ingenuity pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes. Upstream regulator analysis revealed CXCL12- and IGF1-induced signaling and their downstream PI3K-Akt signaling in the cancer cells (Figure 6H). These genes are enriched in biological processes associated with metastasis and bone biology (Figure 6I). Thus, the model tumors co-transplanted with MSCs gained a bioactive CXCL12/IGF1 microenvironment and response features that are characteristic of CAF+ TN tumors.A Mesenchymal Stroma Selects for Bone Metastatic Cells in Mammary TumorsCancer cells were purified from MDA231 mammary tumors, expanded in culture for several passages, and characterized (Figure 7A). Cancer cells recovered from MSC-supplemented tumors showed a high level of pY416-Src compared to populations derived from control tumors (Figures 7B, 7C). Treatment of the mice with inhibitors of the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4 (AMD3100) and of the IGF1 receptor IGF1R (BMS754807) (Figure S7A) during tumor growth prevented the accumulation of pY416-Src-high cells (Figures 7B, 7C), without significantly affecting overall tumor growth. Importantly, cancer cell populations derived from the MSC-supplemented tumors were significantly more metastatic to bone (Figure 7D), without a gain in lung colonizing ability (Figure 7E).Cancer cell populations derived from mice treated with IGF1R and CXCR4 inhibitors were poorly metastatic to bone (Figure 7D). To confirm the specificity of these effects, we knocked down CXCR4 and IGF1R simultaneously in MDA231 cells (Figures 7F, 7G, S7B). Knockdown of the two receptors did not affect the level of pY416-Src in MDA231 cells (Figure 7G) but it prevented MSCs from selecting for carcinoma clones with high pY416-Src content (Figures 7H, 7I). The ability of admixed MSCs to select for clones with high pY416-Src and bone metastatic ability was confirmed in the CN37 cell line (Figures S7C, S7D). Furthermore, primary CAFs isolated from a human breast tumor secreted CXCL12 and IGF1 (12.6 \u00b10.2 ng/ml and 0.44 \u00b10.02 ng/ml, respectively after 96 h in culture) and selected for a pY416-Src enriched cancer cell population when admixed with MDA231 cells forming mammary tumors in mice (Figure 7J). The evidence therefore supports a model in which CAFs in mammary tumors cause an accumulation of stromal CXCL12 and IGF1, and these factors act directly on cancer cells to drive the selection of Src-hyperactive clones that are automatically primed for adaptation to the bone metastatic microenvironment.DISCUSSIONPre-selection of Bone Metastatic Seeds by the Primary Tumor StromaTriple negative breast cancer is a major and particularly aggressive subtype of the disease. Unlike hormone receptor-positive breast tumors, which have a marked tendency to metastasize mainly in bone, TN tumors as a whole prominently metastasize in non-skeletal organs including lungs, liver and brain. We have focused here on a subset of TN tumors that deviates from this trend in that it also metastasizes prominently in bone. Cancer cells from this subset are characterized by a high level of Src activity and a high sensitivity to PI3K-Akt pathway activation by CXCL12 and IGF1. By identifying the primary tumor stroma as a driver of the emergence of this phenotype, the present work illuminates the larger question of how organ-specific metastatic traits may arise in cancer.Our evidence suggests that when the stroma of a TN breast tumor is rich in mesenchymal cells it selects for cancer clones that are fit to thrive on the CAF-derived cytokines CXCL12 and IGF1 (Figure 7K). This selection process leads to a gain in the predisposition of cancer cells for metastasis to bone, a site that is relatively rich in stromal CXCL12 and IGF1 compared to other metastasis target sites. In other major subtypes of breast cancer Src activation is integral to the oncogenic drivers like ER\u03b1 and ERBB2, and might similarly contribute to bone metastatic tropism of these tumors.The clinical evidence also links the CAF content with a predisposition for bone metastasis in TN tumors. In multiple human breast cancer cohorts, TN tumors that score high for cancer cell Src signature present a mesenchymal-rich stroma both based on a CAF gene expression signature and on marker \u03b1SMA immunostaining. These tumors are also characterized by the expression of CXCL12 and IGF1, factors that are mainly of mesenchymal origin in the tumors. Each of these traits in turn is individually associated with an elevated rate of bone relapse.Our experimental evidence suggests that CXCL12 and IGF1 can drive TN cancer cell populations towards enrichment for clones that have a constitutively high level of Src activity and bone metastatic ability. Three essential premises for the clonal evolution of a cancer cell population are fulfilled under these conditions. First, Src activity in the cancer cells acts as a selectable trait that confers heightened sensitivity to CXCL12 and IGF1 as activators of PI3K/Akt survival signaling. Second, this trait ranges widely in the clonally heterogeneous cancer cell population that we examined. Third, the positive selectors for this trait, CXCL12 and IGF1, are present at limiting concentrations in the tumor microenvironment, as determined by analysis of breast tumor transcriptomic data using dose-specific CXCL12/IGF1 response classifiers. When modeled in vitro, the end result of this process is the emergence of Src-hyperactive clones with an intrinsically high ability to survive and outgrow in the CXCL12/IGF1- rich environment of the bone marrow.Further support for this model comes from our experiments with orthotopically implanted mammary tumors in mice supplemented with MSCs or CAFs. We show that mesenchymal supplementation shifts the transcriptome of the cancer cell population in a tumor towards a profile resembling that of CAF+ TN human tumors. Moreover, enriching tumors with MSCs caused CXCL12/IGF1-like stimulation in the cancer cells, and the level of this stimulation at the transcriptome reflected limiting concentrations of the cytokines and was comparable to that observed in CAF+ human tumors. These conditions skew the cancer cell population towards clones with intrinsically high levels of Src activity and a heightened capacity for bone metastasis. The accumulation of these Src hyperactive, bone metastatic cells was dependent on the CXCL12 and IGF1 receptor expression in the cancer cells and was inhibited by administration of pharmacologic inhibitors of these receptors.The Primary Tumor Stroma as a Determinant of Metastatic TropismThe evidence supports a model in which a TN tumor stroma rich in mesenchymal cytokines CXCL12 and IGF1 skews the carcinoma population toward a preponderance of clones with a high level of activated Src and a predisposition to grow in the bone marrow, a soil that is rich in CXCL12 and IGF1 compared to lung, brain and other metastasis target tissues. Thus, similarities between the cytokine microenvironment of CAF-rich primary tumors and that of the bone marrow make the pre-selected metastatic seeds compatible with this target tissue (Figure 7K). Stromal cells that produce CXCL12 and IGF1 in a primary tumor are not necessarily superior to other stromal components in supporting primary tumor growth, but are superior in pre-selecting bone metastatic seeds. Our present findings are limited to the case of bone metastasis tropism in TN breast cancer. It will be important to determine whether these phenomena occur also in other bone metastatic tumor types, and whether other stromal components such as leukocytes may similarly select cancer cells with metastatic tropism for other organs.The ability of the primary tumor stroma to drive the selection of organ-specific metastatic cells is distinct from previously described roles of stromal signals in tumor progression, including roles in the resistance to stress and chemotherapy. These previously described stromal signals do not explain how organ-specific metastatic traits and their associated gene signatures emerge in primary tumors. The formation of pre-metastatic niches by tumor-derived systemic signals that condition distant organs for seeding by disseminated cancer cells also does not entail an acquisition of specific metastatic traits in the primary cancer cell population itself. The mechanism of metastasis seed pre-selection identified here may coexist with other effects of the tumor stroma, but is distinct in that it selects for organ-specific metastatic traits.The interplay between a primary tumor and a specific metastatic site revealed by the present work expands current views on the dynamic nature of metastasis. Coupled with processes of tumor self-seeding whereby previously disseminated cells may repopulate and expand in their tumor of origin, seed pre-selection at the primary site may further sway the organotropic metastatic traits of a primary tumor mass with clinically manifest consequences. Our results also imply that breast cancer cases with a fibroblast-rich stroma or with incipient bone metastasis may benefit from therapies that target the PI3K-Akt cell survival pathway or its amplifier Src for the eradication of disseminated disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESComputational Analyses of Clinical Data SetsSRS was derived as previously described. Stratification of the 615 patients with SRS, ER and ERBB2 in the Erasmus Medical Centre/Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (EMC-MSK) cohort (GSE2603, GSE5327, GSE2034 and GSE12276 data sets) was done with unsupervised clustering implemented by the \u201cheatmap.2\u201d command of the \u201cgplots\u201d package of R statistical programming software. ER+, HER2+ (ER-/HER2+), and triple-negative (TN, ER-/HER2-) subtypes were determined either using the clinical annotation associated with the dataset (if applicable) or by the transcript levels of ESR1 and ERBB2, respectively. The continuous scores of SRS were computed with the sum of z-scores of 159 SRS genes and the DART algorithm.To identify genes associated with SRS status, SRS was applied to EMC-MSK, TRANSBIG (GSE7394), UPPSALA (GSE4922) and STOCKHOLM (GSE1456) datasets. SRS+ and SRS-tumors were compared within the TN subset of each dataset. Genes that are expressed at significantly higher level in SRS+ tumors (p < 0.001 and fold change > 2 for EMC-MSK and p < 0.05 for the other three, t tests with Welch correction) were identified. To compute the combined p value for each gene across all four datasets, we employed Fisher\u2019s combination (see SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION). To further evaluate the significance of these genes, we utilized the TCGA cohort as a validation dataset (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaDownload.jsp). We examined the p values and FDR of the 43 genes by comparing TN/SRS+ tumors with TN/SRS- tumors. Both p values and FDR were computed using \u201csiggene\u201d package in R statistical software based on SAM algorithm. All 38 genes that can be mapped to TCGA platform reach significance (Table S2).Gene signatures associated with CAFs were obtained from a previous study. We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the mean expression of CAF genes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) to determine the CAF status of a tumor. Other stromal cell types were analyzed using the same approaches (see SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION for details).For analyses of correlation between somatic PIK3CA mutation status and SRS, somatic mutation data from the TCGA dataset were matched with mRNA expression data. The overlap between PIK3CA mutation and SRS+ status was assessed with Fisher\u2019s exact test.To examine the correlation between CAF gene expression signature, SRS, and, \u03b1SMA IHC, we divided the IHC staining into three categories depending on the percentage of \u03b1SMA+ fibroblastic cells (see Figure 2E). CAF and SRS signatures were then evaluated as continuous scores (described above) in different categories (Figures 2F, S2C). The statistical difference among the three groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA implemented by R.Cancer Cell-specific Polysome-associated Transcript ProfilingMDA231 cells were engineered to express an EGFP-L10a construct. For the analysis of cytokine responses in vitro, cancer cells were treated for 6h with 30 ng/ml CXCL12 and 10 ng/ml IGF1, or with 300 ng/ml CXCL12 and 100 ng/ml IGF1. For the analysis of gene responses to MSCs in vivo, breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pads of mice with or without a 1:1 admixture of MSCs, and tumors were harvested 3 weeks later. Cultured cells or tumors were lysed and immediately subjected to TRAP as previously described with modifications described in Supplementary Information.For RNA-seq data analysis, the raw sequence data (FASTQ files) were mapped using TopHat (v1.4.0) to the human genome (hg19 build) available from UCSC. 89% of reads were uniquely mapped on average. Gene level expression counts were determined using HTSeq and normalized with DESeq. The normalized counts were then log-transformed for analysis. Genes with zero counts were still assigned as zeros after log-transformation to avoid exceptions in programming. The approaches of subsequent analyses were described in SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION.Animal StudiesAll animal work was done in accordance with a protocol approved by the MSKCC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Intracardiac injections of cancer cells for bone metastasis assays, intravenous injections for lung colonization assays, and orthotopic injections for mammary tumor formation were performed as previously described. Animals were imaged weekly by bioluminescence imaging (IVIS Xenogen). For quantification of bioluminescence signal, all signals were normalized to the signals at Day 0 right after injection. For bone metastases, signals at hind limbs and vertebrae were jointly quantified. Osteolytic lesions were visualized by X-ray radiography and were identified on radiographs as demarcated radiolucent lesions in the bone. Cancer cells from mammary tumors were retrieved by enzyme digestion (0.125% collagenase III and 0.1% hyaluronidase in DMEM/F12 medium) and GFP sorted for further experiments or inoculation into mice. Dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb) was administered by daily oral gavage with a dose of 10 mg/kg in PBS. AMD3100 (Tocris, Cat. No: 3299), a CXCR4 inhibitor, was administered by subcutaneous injection twice a day at 2.5 mg/kg in PBS. BMS754807 (ChemieTek, Cat. No: CT-BMS75), an IGF1R inhibitor was administered by daily oral gavage at 6.25 mg/kg in polyethyleneglycol:H2O (4:1).Supplementary MaterialThis is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

This might be a common mechanism for acquiring metastatic potential in breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and metastasis is the leading cause of death in breast cancer patients. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of breast cancer, tumours with the same clinical and pathological status may differ in metastatic potential, and therefore lead to different prognoses. Metastasis of breast cancer cells requires decreased cell\u2013cell adhesion, but increased cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion, and enhanced invasiveness and motility via secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes and cytoskeletal reorganisation. A well-recognised mechanism for initiating tumour cell invasive and metastatic behaviour is epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which polarised epithelial breast cancer cells acquire a motile mesenchymal phenotype. However, the common mechanisms of induction of metastasis in breast cancers with different biological characteristics remain undefined. A better understanding of such mechanisms could lead to find universal molecular targets for anti-metastasis therapy.The metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is closely dependent on the tumour microenvironment. The fibroblast is the predominant stromal cell type in tumour microenvironment of heterogeneous breast cancer tissues. Tumour cells activate stromal fibroblast cells into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through the stimulation of paracrine growth factors, and CAFs are more effective than normal stromal fibroblasts in promoting the cell survival, growth and progression of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts secrete a number of growth factors, including transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which is a strong extracellular signal regulating EMT in cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts also secrete chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)/stromal derived factor1 (SDF-1) to induce EMT of cancer cells. In addition, ECM, the non-cellular composition of the tumour microenvironment, is mainly synthesised by CAFs. It functions as a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells through ECM remodelling by ECM-degrading proteases secreted from cancer cells with the EMT phenotype.There is a consensus that CAFs can affect the metastatic behaviour of breast cancer cells. However, it is unclear how CAFs affect the metastatic potential of breast cancers with different biological characteristics. In the present study, we demonstrated that CAFs could enhance the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells with different characteristics through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Different EMT programmes were activated in different breast cancer cells because of the different responses to CAF paracrine extracellular signalling.Materials and MethodsIsolation and culture of stromal fibroblastsTo isolate stromal fibroblasts, primary cancer tissues were obtained from three female breast cancer patients at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH; Tianjin, China). These patients had undergone mastectomy but had not been treated with preoperative chemotherapy. The tissue specimens were divided into three parts for histopathological diagnosis, mRNA and protein extraction and isolation of stromal fibroblasts. The investigation and the use of specimens were approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH and written consent was obtained from participants.The breast cancer tissue specimens used for isolation of stromal fibroblasts were diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma with histological grade II and classified as luminal A subtype with oestrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative. Importantly, the specimens were assessed by haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) to confirm that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells in the heterogeneous cancer tissue (Figure 1A and B).The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 160\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 collagenase A (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and 25\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 hyaluronidase (Sigma) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 3\u2009h. Then the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mixture F12 (DMEM/F12; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) until cells grew into a confluent monolayer. After 2\u20133 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All the stromal fibroblasts used in the experiments were at less than 10 passages. To prepare conditioned medium of cultured CAFs (CAF-CM) for breast cancer cell treatments, stromal fibroblasts isolated from three tissue specimens were mixed and cultured for 48\u2009h, then collected and centrifuged for 10\u2009min at 5000\u2009r.p.m. to remove cell debris.Culture of breast cancer cell linesBreast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, each with different biological characteristics and metastatic potential, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or DMEM/F12 (T47D) medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100\u2009units per ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells in logarithmic growth phase or at 80% confluence were used for experiments. Breast cancer cell lines were treated with the CM of stromal fibroblasts, diluted with an equal volume of fresh medium for 2 days. An equal volume of complete culture medium was used as the control.Cell\u2013ECM adhesion assayBreast cancer cells were plated in Matrigel-coated 12-well plates at 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well. The non-adherent cells were counted after being cultured for the appropriate time and the percentage of adherent cells was calculated as (1\u2013non-adherent cells/total inoculated cells) \u00d7 100%.Wound-healing assayBreast cancer cells were plated in six-well plates at 5 \u00d7 105 cells per well to grow into a monolayer. A linear scratch/wound was made on cell monolayers with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs were taken of live cells at \u00d7 100 magnification and the distance migrated was observed within an appropriate time.Cell migration and invasion assayThe invasion and migration abilities of breast cancer cells in vitro were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). 5 \u00d7 104 cells in 500\u2009\u03bcl serum-free medium were added to the upper chamber, and medium containing 20% FBS was added into the lower chamber. The cells were left to invade the Matrigel for the appropriate time, the non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed by wiping, and the invading cells were fixed and stained with a three-step stain set kit (Richard-Allan Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The number of invading or migrating cells was counted under a microscope in five predetermined fields for each membrane at \u00d7 400 magnification.TGF-\u03b2 signalling analysisBreast cancer cells were cultured with CM of stromal fibroblasts containing 50\u2009\u03bcg\u2009ml\u22121 TGF-\u03b21 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) to neutralise TGF-\u03b21, or 1.0\u2009\u03bcmol\u2009ml\u22121 SB-431542 (Sigma) to block the TGF-\u03b2 signalling of breast cancer cells.Reverse transcription-quantitative PCRTotal RNA of tissues or cultured cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using a First-strand cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We quantified the transcripts of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an internal mRNA quantity control, as previously described. All primers and TaqMan probes for cDNA amplification of various target genes were designed and optimised using Oligo 6.0 software (Molecular Biology Insights, West Cascade, USA), and synthesised by Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services (Shanghai, China). Triplicate quantitative PCR reactions were performed for both target genes and the housekeeping gene using Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative expression level of the target gene was calculated by normalising the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target gene to the Ct values of GAPDH (\u0394Ct), and determined as 2\u2212\u0394Ct.ImmunohistochemistryBreast cancer cells growing on sterile coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Tissue specimens were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Immunohistochemistry staining of specimens was carried out using the primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA (1A4; DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark), anti-Vimentin (V9; Invitrogen) and anti-E-cadherin (4A2C7; Invitrogen); the secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used at appropriate concentration. Staining was performed with diaminobenzidine; hematoxylin was used for counterstaining.ImmunoblottingHarvested cells were lysed with protein lysis buffer containing 20\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 5\u2009mM EDTA acid, 1% Triton X-100, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% dithiothreitol and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). The proteins in the lysate were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a polyvinyldifluoride membrane (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The primary antibodies used were anti-Vimentin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-TGF-\u03b2RII (K105; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Massachusetts, USA), anti-Smad2 (86F7; Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-pSmad2 (Phospho-Ser245/250/255; Cell Signaling Technology) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20091000, \u03b2-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20093000, and the secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used at a dilution of 1\u2009:\u20092500. The protein blotting on the membranes was performed as previously described. The immunoreactive protein bands on the membranes were visualised using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare).Immunofluorescence stainingCells were seeded on the coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20\u2009min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilised in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15\u2009min, washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained using DAPI permamount. The protein expression was visualised using a fluorescence microscope.Cytokine antibody array analysisThe TGF\u03b2s secreted from CAFs were analysed using a Cytokine Antibody Array (R&D Systems) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, membranes were incubated with 1.0\u2009ml of CAF-CM at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted biotin-conjugated antibodies were added to each membrane, which was then incubated at room temperature for 1\u20132\u2009h. Diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to each membrane and incubated at room temperature for 2\u2009h. The membranes were placed into the mixed Detection Buffer and exposed to X-ray film. The intensities of signals were quantified by ScanAlyze software (Michael Eisen, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). A positive control was used to normalise the results from the different membranes being compared. All samples were performed in duplicates.Statistical analysisData are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation. Student's t-test and rank sum test were used to compare the differences between the experimental group and control group. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05.ResultsThe stromal fibroblasts isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibit characteristics of CAFsTo characterise stromal fibroblasts in the microenvironment of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from primary breast cancer tissues. In the primary breast cancer tissue, we observed that there were stromal cells surrounding the cancer nests and distributed among the invasive cancer cells (Figure 1A), and some of them were active fibroblasts with positive \u03b1-SMA staining (Figure 1B). The stromal cells separated from primary breast cancer tissues were a heterogeneous mixture of a variety of cells in the primary culture, with fibroblasts being the main component. After passaging the primary culture cells, uniform fibroblasts started to grow (Figure 1C). The stromal fibroblasts showed positive staining for the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Figure 1D) and negative staining for the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Figure 1E). In particular, they expressed the activated myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA (Figure 1F) and CXCL12 (Supplementary Figure 1A). These results indicated that the isolated and cultured fibroblasts in vitro from breast cancer tissues maintained the features of CAFs.To investigate whether the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro are retained features of CAFs, we detected the expression of E-cadherin, \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 in CAFs at different low passages. The results showed that the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 were similar in all the CAFs at different passages, and E-cadherin was not expressed in any CAFs at different passages (Supplementary Figure 1B and C), which indicated that the fibroblats at low passages cultured in vitro retained the features of CAFs.CAFs enhanced aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cellsTo investigate the effects of CAFs on breast cancer cells with different intrinsic characteristics, the CAF-CM was collected and used to culture breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231. The epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells cultured with CAF-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering. The mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cells cultured with CAF-CM were also changed to more fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 2A). All the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM had enhanced cell\u2013ECM adhesion (Figure 2B), migration (Figure 2C\u2013E) and invasion (Figure 2F and G) compared with the control cells. All the above results suggested that CAF-secreted proteins could stimulate these different breast cancer cell lines to change their morphologies and phenotypes to have more metastatic potential.CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cellsTo investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by CAF-CM in breast cancer cell lines, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin (CDH1), mesenchymal marker vimentin (VIM) and fibronectin 1 (FN1), as well as matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells incubated with CAF-CM. Results showed that cells cultured with CAF-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in MCF-7 and T47D cells, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A and C). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker VIM, FN1, MMP2 and MMP9 were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM (Figure 3B and D). These results indicated that factors secreted by CAFs could induce the EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.To investigate whether EMT programming was activated by CAF-secreted factors in these breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics, the expression of EMT-related transcription factors (EMT-TFs) snail homolog 1 (SNAI1), SNAI2, twist basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) and zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) was measured in breast cancer cell lines cultured with CAF-CM. The results showed that SNAI1 expression levels were upregulated in all the three cell lines cultured with CAF-CM, SNAI2 expression levels were upregulated in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells but not in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells, TWIST1 expression levels were upregulated in mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 cells but not in epithelial MCF-7 and T47D cells, and ZEB1 expression levels were upregulated only in MCF-7 cells (Figure 3E). These results indicated that CAF-secreted proteins induced the EMT phenotype through common and/or unique activation of EMT-TFs in breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics.CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling in breast cancer cells via CAF-secreted TGF-\u03b21As TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer, we examined whether CAFs secreted any TGF isoform into CAF-CM. Our results showed that CAFs secreted significantly more TGF-\u03b21 than TGF-\u03b22 or TGF-\u03b23 (Figure 4A). We then compared the mRNA expression of the TGF-\u03b21-coding gene TGFB1 in CAFs and breast cancer cell lines. Our results showed that TGFB1 expression levels were significantly higher in CAFs than those in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 was mainly secreted by the CAFs in the co-culture of CAFs with breast cancer cells.To investigate the effect of CAF-CM on activation of TGF-\u03b2 signalling in breast cancer cell lines, we compared the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 receptor type II (TGF-\u03b2RII), total Smad2 and phosphorylated Smad2 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CM or control medium. The results showed that CAF-CM significantly increased phosphorylated Smad2 in MCF-7, T47D and MDA-MB-231, whereas total Smad2 was not affected. Although TGF-\u03b2RII expression levels were different in the three cell lines, they were not affected by culturing with CAF-CM (Figure 4C). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 secretion by breast cancer cells was not affected neither (Figure 4D). These results indicate that CAFs activated TGF-\u03b2/Smad signalling pathway in breast cancer cells mainly through paracrine TGF-\u03b21.EMT programming and phenotype were reversed by blocking TGF-\u03b21 in breast cancer cells cultured in CAF-CMTo further test the role of TGF-\u03b21 signalling in EMT phenotype changes of breast cancer cells, TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody and TGF-\u03b2 signalling blocking reagent SB-431542 were added to CAF-CM for culturing epithelial cells MCF-7 and mesenchymal-like cells MDA-MB-231. Then, the expression of epithelial markers, mesenchymal markers and EMT-TFs were examined. After culturing in CAF-CM, the E-cadherin expression in MCF-7 cells was reduced, and vimentin expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was increased. Moreover, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5A). Similarly, the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was also reversed by adding TGF-\u03b21-neutralising antibody (Figure 5B). Consistent with the effects of TGF-\u03b21 neutralising antibody, adding SB-431542 in CAF-CM also reversed the reduced E-cadherin in MCF-7 cells, the increased vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells, and the upregulated FN1 expression in both cell lines stimulated by CAF-CM (Figure 5C), as well as the upregulated SNAI1 expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the enhanced abilities of migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by CAF-CM were reversed by adding anti-TGF-\u03b21 antibody (Figure 5E and F). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b21 secreted from CAFs was an important regulator for activation of EMT programming and phenotype in breast cancer cells with different characteristics.DiscussionIsolation of stromal fibroblasts from invasive cancer tissues followed by low-passaged cultures in vitro is the main approach to investigate the biological characteristics of CAFs and their effects on tumour cells. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin is commonly used as a marker of myofibroblast formation to identify CAFs, and its expression is higher in fibroblasts derived from cancer tissues than in those derived from normal tissues. Evidence has shown that stromal fibroblasts isolated from cancer tissues such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer retain the characteristics of CAFs, with high levels of \u03b1-SMA expression. As luminal A is the most common subtype of breast cancer, we isolated and cultured stromal fibroblasts from invasive luminal A subtype breast cancer tissues, and confirmed that the fibroblasts expressed high levels of \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12/SDF-1, which is a typical characteristic of CAFs. Moreover, CAFs at low passages cultured in vitro retained their original features, which was consistent with the Kalluri's report.There have been reports that CAFs could promote aggressive behaviour of breast cancer cells.) demonstrated that downregulation of p16INK4A transformed normal breast fibroblasts into CAFs, which in turn enhanced migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner.) showed that CAFs enhanced migration by promoting EMT of PMC42-LA cells.) found that CAFs promoted EMT of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells, including luminal cells (MCF-7), basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) and cells with both luminal epithelial and myoepithelial characteristics (PMC42-LA). In this study, we demonstrated that factors secreted by CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviours of cell\u2013ECM adhesion, migration and invasion in both luminal (MCF-7 and T47D) and basal-like (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells by inducing or promoting EMT. This suggests that CAF-induced EMT might be the common mechanism underlying the acquisition of metastatic potential in different breast cancer subtypes.EMT enables cancer cells to acquire the ability to complete various steps in the metastatic cascade, and this change in phenotype of epithelial cancer cells is induced by paracrine signals from their microenvironment. It is known that CAFs can induce or promote EMT in a variety of cancers, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not clear. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 is a prominent EMT-inducer. Tumour cells can induce and maintain the EMT phenotype through autocrine secretion of TGF-\u03b2, and can also transform stromal fibroblasts into CAFs by paracrine TGF-\u03b2 signalling. Although CAFs can also secrete TGF-\u03b2, it is little known whether or how CAF-paracrine TGF-\u03b2 induces EMT in tumour cells. By detection of the CAF-CM collected from CAFs cultured in vitro, we found that TGF-\u03b21 was the major TGF-\u03b2 family member secreted by CAFs. We also found that TGF-\u03b21 was expressed by CAFs significantly more than by cancer cells, and stimulation of CAF-paracrine factors did not significantly increase expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b2RII in the breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, by using a pharmacological inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase to inhibit the receptors of tumour cells, and neutralising antibodies to inhibit secreted TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs, we found that TGF-\u03b21, mainly secreted by CAFs, could induce EMT in different subtypes of breast cancers.Interestingly, we found that CAF-paracrine signalling induced EMT in breast cancer cells with different characteristics are underlying common and/or unique pleiotropically acting EMT-TFs. SNAI1 was activated by CAF-CM in the three breast cancer cell lines: epithelial/luminal A cells MCF-7 and T47D, and mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells MDA-MB-231. SNAI2 and ZEB1 were activated in epithelial/luminal A cells (SNAI2 in both MCF-7 and T47D, ZEB1 only in MCF-7) but not in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231). TWIST1 was activated in mesenchymal-like/basal-like cells (MDA-MB-231) but not in epithelial cells/luminal A cells (MCF-7 and T47D). This novel observation indicates that different EMT programmes are activated in different subtypes of breast cancer cells specific to their responses to CAF-paracrine signalling. Another interesting finding in our in vitro experiments is that exogenous TGF-\u03b2 alone did not promote EMT of breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore, although TGF-\u03b2 is a key modulator secreted by CAFs for promoting EMT of breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics, it needs co-factors to facilitate this process, and the exact mechanism remains to be further explored.In summary, CAFs could stimulate morphological and phenotypic changes in various breast cancer subtype cells to enhance their metastatic potential through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. This might be a common mechanism for metastasis among breast cancer cells with different biological characteristics.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on British Journal of Cancer website (http://www.nature.com/bjc)This work is published under the standard license to publish agreement.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "content": "Tumor-stroma interactions are important determinants for the disease course in cancer. While stromal influence has been known to often play a tumor-promoting role, incomplete mechanistic insight into this phenomenon has prevented its therapeutic targeting. Stromal fibroblasts can be activated by tumor cells to differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), that exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, and in turn, they increase cancer aggressiveness. Here, we report the crosstalk between the cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts that leads to tumor progression. The process is initiated by secretion of a chemokine like protein, osteopontin (OPN) from the cancer cells that differentiates the fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Tumor-derived OPN achieves this transition by engaging CD44 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins on the fibroblast surface, which mediates signaling via Akt and ERK to induce Twist1-dependent gene expression. The OPN-driven CAFs then secrete CXCL12, which in turn triggers epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the tumor cells. OPN, produced by the cancer cells, and CXCL12, secreted by activated fibroblasts, are necessary and sufficient to perpetuate the crosstalk. Knocking out OPN in carcinogen-induced mammary tumors or knocking down OPN in cancer cells and fibroblast co-implanted xenografts abrogates myofibroblast differentiation, Twist1, and CXCL12 expression. OPN expression is correlated with CAF-specific gene signature as shown by breast tumor tissue microarray consisting of 100 patient specimens. Bioinformatics analyses have confirmed that the expression of OPN is significantly correlated with the expression of myofibroblast-specific markers as demonstrated in human breast carcinoma dataset of 2509 patients. Our findings describe OPN and CXCL12 act as compelling targets to curb the tumor-promoting features of the stromal components and further suggested that OPN-regulated CXCL12 network might act as potential therapeutic target for the management of CAF-mediated breast cancer progression.",

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

Along with cancer cells, the host of nonmalignant cellular and noncellular components that arise during the course of tumorigenesis results in a local tumor niche, or TME. These non-cancer-cell constituents of the tumor stroma include cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and adipocytes, as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) components, among others. Increasing evidence shows that a set of these cell types are co-opted by cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) contributing to tumor initiation, growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. As a result, stromal cells are widely believed to contribute to the initiation of epithelial carcinomas and subsequent tumor progression. Specific to breast cancer, clinical evidence and various neoplastic models have linked mammary stromal cells to tumorigenesis. Despite these discoveries implicating the tumor stroma in carcinogenesis, a robust understanding of the cell signaling pathways between various components of the TME remains to be seen. Therefore, elucidating the signaling that underpins stromal-epithelial crosstalk and communication amongst stromal cells is critical to progress the translation of TME-based anticancer therapies and address the broad clinical challenge of metastasis.Fibroblasts are found in various carcinomas and are often the most abundant cell population of the tumor stroma. While normal fibroblasts have multiple physiological functions\u2014from the connective tissue-producing role of secreting fibrous collagens to the recruitment of immune cells and regulation of inflammation\u2014CAFs play an active role in reshaping the TME to support tumor cell survival and proliferation. In breast cancer, CAFs can originate from a variety of sources, including cancer stem cells and reprogrammed native fibroblastic cells; however, independent of their origin, CAFs are classified by their activated state resembling myofibroblasts during inflammation and wound healing. The activated state of CAFs leads to the excessive deposition of various ECM proteins, e.g., type I collagen, thereby implicating CAFs in the creation of a desmoplastic stroma common in epithelial tumors, including breast cancer. In addition to fibrosis and increased matrix stiffness, CAFs have been demonstrated to induce cancer proliferation and enhance migration, invasion, and distant metastasis in breast cancer.One of the more recent strategies to combat the effects of CAFs on tumorigenesis has been to target CAF-secreted growth factors and chemokines, e.g., stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), also known as CXCL12. The success of this approach relies heavily on a comprehensive understanding of the signaling network between CAFs and other cellular constituents of the TME. In 2005, Orimo et al. first showed that CAFs play a central role in promoting the proliferation of breast cancer cells through their ability to secrete CXCL12. CXCL12 acts directly on mammary carcinoma cells through the cognate receptor CXCR4 to stimulate tumor growth. Additionally, CAFs were able to induce angiogenesis through CXCL12-mediated recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). As an extension of this pioneering work, continued efforts have been made to characterize the regulatory role of fibroblast-derived CXCL12 within the TME and its mechanistic effect on metastasis. Herein, we demonstrate in an in vitro microfluidic model that stromal CXCL12 secreted by CAFs enhances vascular permeability. These findings suggest that CXCL12 secreted by CAFs promotes metastasis through the expansion of a leaky tumor vasculature. Furthermore, we evaluate the autocrine role of CXCL12 on CAFs\u2019 ability to contract and remodel the ECM. These findings collectively bolster the understanding of fibroblast-derived CXCL12 to facilitate tumor angiogenesis and intravasation, ultimately leading to metastasis.Materials and methodsEthics statementUsage of mice and experimentation with their harvested cells was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Ohio State University.Cell cultureMouse embryonic endothelial cells (MEECs) were a generous gift from Dr. Nam Y. Lee of the Ohio State University (OSU). MEECs were cultured in endothelial cell media with an endothelial cell supplement kit, including 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and heparin (Cell Biologics). Endothelial cells were cultured in T-75 flasks in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 with media exchange every 2\u00a0days. Cell passage numbers of 5\u201310 were used for the study. MEECs were harvested from flasks using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen), centrifuged, and resuspended in cell media at a concentration of \u223c7 \u00d7 106\u00a0cells\u00a0ml\u22121. MEECs were then pipetted into both lateral microchannels of the device and allowed to adhere within the cell culture incubator overnight at 37\u00b0C to obtain an endothelial monolayer. Endothelial media was exchanged daily after seeding to promote healthy cell growth. For experimental conditions with conditioned media, cells were permitted to be cultured within the device for 1\u00a0day prior to the introduction of conditioned media to stabilize the microvessel analogues and ensure treatment arms did not influence initial cell attachment.Normal mouse mammary gland fibroblasts (MMFs) were harvested from the mammary glands of either Cxcl12 floxed control (Cxcl12f/f) mice to obtain CXCL12f/f fibroblasts (also denoted as \u201cf/f\u201d fibroblasts), or from fibroblast-specific conditional knockout (Cxcl12\u2206/\u2206) mice to obtain CXCL12\u2206/\u2206 fibroblasts (also denoted as \u201c\u2206/\u2206\u201d fibroblasts), as previously described. Briefly, with respect to the knockout allele, the Cxcl12 gene was flanked by LoxP sites. To delete the LoxP-flanked Cxcl12 gene, we introduced Cre recombinase by breeding Cxcl12 transgenic mice with FSP-Cre expressing mice. The Cre recombinase expression in FSP-Cre mice is driven by fibroblast-specific protein (FSP) promoter. As FSP is specifically expressed by fibroblasts, the Cxcl12 gene in double transgenic mice (Cxcl12 f/f; FSP-Cre or Cxcl12\u2206/\u2206) will specifically be deleted in the fibroblasts. Normal mammary glands harvested from 8-week-old FVB female mice were minced and digested with a cocktail of collagenase IV and hyaluronidase in the presence of hydrocortisone, insulin, and antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator for 2\u00a0h at 37\u00b0C. Digested tissue was resuspended in a medium with 10% FBS, and supernatants were subjected four more times to gravity sedimentation for 12\u201315\u00a0min to obtain isolated MMFs.To acquire cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter Polyoma middle T antigen (PyT) (Jackson laboratories) was intercrossed with either Cxcl12 floxed control (Cxcl12f/f) mice to generate Cxcl12f/f; PyT mice, or with fibroblast-specific conditional knockout (Cxcl12\u2206/\u2206) mice to generate Cxcl12\u2206/\u2206; PyT mice. The tumor-bearing mammary glands of Cxcl12f/f; PyT mice were used to harvest CXCL12f/f; PyT cancer-associated fibroblasts (also denoted as \u201cf/f; PyT\u201d CAFs), while the tumor-bearing mammary glands of Cxcl12\u2206/\u2206; PyT mice were used to harvest CXCL12\u2206/\u2206; PyT cancer-associated fibroblasts (also denoted as \u201c\u2206/\u2206; PyT\u201d CAFs). The PyT tumors of 8-week-old FVB female mice were similarly digested with the cocktail of collagenase IV and hyaluronidase for 30\u00a0min under incubation, and CAFs were isolated by gravity sedimentation, as described above. CAFs were further enriched by differential trypsinization two times. After isolation, MMFs and CAFs were maintained in DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with insulin, hydrocortisone, epidermal growth factor, and 10% FBS (Sigma Aldrich). Fibroblast media was exchanged every 2\u00a0days during culture leading up to seeding. Fibroblasts were used in experiments at low passage numbers (2\u20134) to minimize potential cellular changes associated with extended culture of harvested primary cells.ImmunofluorescenceIsolated CAFs were seeded into 4-well chamber slides (Thermo Scientific) at a concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 105\u00a0cells/ml. After 24\u00a0h, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT), and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5\u00a0min at RT. After washing with 1X PBS, cells were blocked with 5% BSA in 1X PBS for 1\u00a0h at RT. Subsequently, primary antibodies were added to wells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C: CXCL12 antibody at 12.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml concentration (R&D Systems, MAB350), PDGFR-\u03b1 antibody at 1:1000 dilution (CST, 3174), and Nidogen-2 at 1:400 dilution (Abcam, ab14513). After aspiration and extensive washing with 1X PBS, secondary antibodies were added and incubated for 1\u00a0h at RT: AF-594 anti-rabbit and AF-488 anti-mouse (1:1000 dilution, Invitrogen). The slide was washed with 1X PBS, and the coverslip was mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The slide was stored at 4\u00b0C until imaging. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope: representative images were taken at \u00d740 magnification, and quantification of PDGFR-\u03b1 and Nidogen-2 was performed on \u00d710 images. For quantification, mean pixel intensity was quantified by NIH ImageJ software and normalized by dividing by total cell count (n \u2265 150 cells) to obtain intensity per cell in arbitrary units (AU).Western blottingWestern blot analysis was performed as previously described. Briefly, the cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with proteases and phosphatase inhibitors. Total protein was estimated with Bradford protein assay, per manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, 40\u00a0\u03bcg of protein was loaded on 4\u201312% gradient SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (NFDM) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). The membrane was incubated overnight with anti-CXCR4 primary antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-53534) at a 1:200 dilution, washed 3 times with TBST, and incubated for 1\u00a0h at RT with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) in blocking buffer. Membranes were washed and developed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Thermo Scientific) and immediately exposed to autoradiography film (GeneMate). \u2206/\u2206; PyT CAFs from Cxcl12\u2206/\u2206; PyT mice were unavailable for the Western blot.Microfluidic microtissue analogueThe microtissue analogue system, was fabricated using soft lithography of poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as previously reported. This configuration enabled us to create laterally adjacent stromal and endothelial compartments to mimic the in vivo conditions for fibroblast and EC interactions within the tumor stroma. Briefly, the base and curing agent of PDMS were mixed at a ratio of 10:1, respectively, and poured onto a patterned silicon wafer. After curing for at least 2\u00a0h at 65\u00b0C, the PDMS layer was subsequently bonded to a glass slide by oxygen plasma treatment. Type I collagen (Corning) sourced from rat tail tendon was pipetted into the central ECM compartment of the device at a concentration of 6\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121 and incubated for at least 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C to polymerize. For experimental co-culture conditions, CAFs were added to the collagen matrix at a density of 6 \u00d7 103\u00a0cells per \u00b5l prior to polymerization and pipetted into the stromal compartment of the device in a similar fashion. Lateral microchannels were coated with fibronectin (100\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121) at least 30\u00a0min prior to cell seeding to improve cellular attachment and biocompatibility of the device. Upon seeding, mouse embryonic endothelial cells (MEECs) lined the lateral channels to form in vitro microvessel analogues within a microtissue system.Apparent vascular permeabilityCollagen hydrogel was added to the central ECM compartment of the device at a concentration of 6\u00a0mg\u00a0ml\u22121 to minimize spontaneous sprouting. Previously, we confirmed using confocal microscopy that in the microtissue system endothelial cells form a confluent monolayer at the endothelial cell/ECM interface. MEECs were cultured in the microtissue system for 3\u00a0days prior to permeability measurements: 24\u00a0h with control media and the subsequent 48\u00a0h with the respective media, conditioned or otherwise. Endothelial media was added to T-75 culture flasks with CAFs at approximately 90% confluency and incubated for 24\u00a0h to generate conditioned media. Conditioned media was freshly prepared for each experimental run. A volume of 2\u00a0\u00b5l of 70\u00a0kDa Texas-Red-conjugated Dextran was passively loaded into one of the MEEC-lined microchannels as a fluorescent tracer at a concentration of 0.05\u00a0mM. Dye diffusion across the interface of the vessel microchannel into the collagen ECM channel was detected using time-lapse epifluorescent microscopy (TS-100, Nikon) over the course of 3\u00a0hours under temperature-controlled incubator conditions. Changes in fluorescence intensity within the adjacent ECM region were quantified using NIH ImageJ software to define apparent vascular permeability. Apparent permeability, , was calculated using Eq. 1:where  is the initial source intensity in the vessel channel immediately proximate to each aperture,  is the change in intensity over time in the adjacent ECM region, and  is the volume-to-surface area ratio of the dye-loading microvessel analogue channel.Collagen gel contraction assayThe contractility of fibroblasts was measured to quantify the physical remodeling of fibroblast-laden collagen gels. Collagen gels were prepared by adding fibroblasts suspended in cell media at a density of 1.0 \u00d7 106\u00a0cells/ml to a type I collagen solution (Corning) at a concentration of 1\u00a0mg/ml. A total volume of 500\u00a0\u00b5l was cast into each well of a 24-well plate with four replicates per condition. Collagen gels polymerized for 30\u00a0min at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Following polymerization, an additional 500\u00a0\u00b5l of fibroblast media was added to each well. AMD3100 (Tocris) was reconstituted to a concentration of 10\u00a0\u00b5M in fibroblast media to passively diffuse into collagen hydrogels for experimental conditions involving the CXCR4-blocking agent. Images of gels were taken with a stereo microscope (Nikon, SMZ18) across 3\u00a0days. The surface area of the gels was quantified by NIH ImageJ software at each time point. The percent contraction was determined by Eq. 2:where  and  are the surface area of the well and fibroblast-embedded collagen gel, respectively.Statistical analysisEach experimental condition was conducted at least in triplicate. Reported values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Ordinary one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out for apparent permeability data with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test to identify statistical significance compared to control. Two-way ANOVA was performed for analysis of contraction assay with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons test to compare between groups. Post hoc unpaired, two-tailed Student t-tests were performed, as necessary. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software), and statistical significance was set to \u03b1 = 0.05: *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p < 0.001.Results and discussionSubclasses of cancer-associated fibroblasts and CXCR4 expressionSubpopulations of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts have been previously reported by interrogating the transcriptome of isolated murine CAFs using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). The proposed taxonomy of CAFs in breast cancer defined discrete subtypes by their gene expression profiles. Among the subclasses, vascular CAFs (vCAFs) and matrix CAFs (mCAFs) play important roles in breast tumorigenesis and were of particular interest given the context of our microfluidic model, which is constituted by matrix-embedded CAFs in proximity to microvessel analogues. To better characterize our f/f; PyT CAFs at the molecular level, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) on isolated cells to stain for the vCAF marker Nidogen-2, and the mCAF marker PDGFR-\u03b1 (Figures 1A,B). We found both Nidogen-2-positive vCAFs and PDGFR-\u03b1-positive mCAFs; however, the fluorescence intensity of PDGFR-\u03b1 was nearly 3-fold higher than that of Nidogen-2, suggesting a greater subpopulation of mCAFs than vCAFs (Figure 1C). Furthermore, each subclass of CAFs is attributable to a putative origin: vCAFs derive from perivascular cells that invade the tumor stroma, and mCAFs originate from co-opted resident fibroblasts. Thus, we conclude that we had a greater preponderance of mCAFs originating from local fibroblasts that had been co-opted by the breast tumor. The higher PDGFR-\u03b1 signal exhibited by our f/f; PyT CAFs harvested from 8-week-old mice is also in agreement with who reported that PDGFR-\u03b1-positive mCAFs from the MMTV-PyMT tumor mouse model were most prevalent at 8\u00a0weeks and decreased during tumor progression through 15\u00a0weeks.Molecular characterization of fibroblasts isolated from mouse mammary glands. (A,B) Representative confocal images of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of CXCL12 (green) and PDGFR-\u03b1 (red for A) and Nidogen-2 (red for B). Nuclei (blue) were counterstained with DAPI. Scale bars are 20\u00a0\u00b5m. (C) Quantification of fluorescence intensity of PDGFR-\u03b1 and Nidogen-2 per cell from confocal IF images. Values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, with n = 4 technical replicates: *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p < 0.001 from unpaired t-test. (D) Western blot analysis of CXCR4 from fibroblast lysates derived from mouse mammary glands. f/f: floxed control allele MMFs, \u2206/\u2206: CXCL12-knockout MMFs, f/f; PyT: CAFs from tumor-bearing mammary glands of Cxcl12f/f;PyT mice. CXCR4 expression is preserved in the CXCL12 genetically ablated fibroblasts and robust in CAFs.We next examined the relative basal levels of CXCR4 protein expression among the fibroblasts via Western blot analysis. Floxed control allele MMFs (f/f), CXCL12-knockout MMFs (\u2206/\u2206), and CAFs from tumor-bearing Cxcl12f/f;PyT mice (f/f; PyT) were isolated from mouse mammary glands and included for analysis. The fibroblast-specific gene deletion of CXCL12 did not have a significant effect on CXCR4 expression evidenced by comparing \u2206/\u2206 fibroblasts to their wild-type counterparts (f/f) (Figure 1D). Moreover, the receptor CXCR4 is robustly expressed in f/f; PyT CAFs and qualitatively higher compared to MMFs. Taken together, we conclude that CXCR4 expression is preserved in the CXCL12 genetically ablated fibroblasts, and that disruption of CXCL12 signaling via competition with AMD3100 to CXCR4 is possible in each of the fibroblast cell lines.Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 is a major driver of vessel permeabilityOur microtissue analogue device was employed to investigate the role of soluble fibroblast-derived CXCL12 on endothelial vessel function. MEECs lined one microchannel of the device, which laterally interfaced with an adjacent stromal compartment containing a 3-D hydrogel of type I collagen (Figures 2A,B). Texas Red-conjugated Dextran (MW \u223c70\u00a0kDa) dissolved in media served as a fluorescent tracer. Changes in fluorescence intensity within the stromal compartment were used to calculate apparent vascular permeability (Figure 2C). These measurements were obtained for MEEC microvessel analogues in the presence of conditioned media (CM) collected from respective CAFs or from co-culture models in which CAFs were embedded within the collagen gel matrix in the central compartment. As a control condition, the apparent permeability of MEEC-lined channels was measured using normal endothelial culture media in the absence of fibroblasts.Compartmentalized microfluidic device for vascular permeability measurements. (A) Schematic of microtissue analogue microfluidic device. (B) Dashed boxed region in (A) depicting endothelial cell-lined microchannel laterally adjacent to a central stromal compartment containing fibroblasts embedded in a 3-D type I collagen gel. Arrows depict the endothelial-stromal compartment interface. (C) Texas Red-conjugated Dextran (70\u00a0kDa) dissolved in media served as a fluorescent tracer and was introduced into the MEEC-lined channel. The fluorescent tracer passes through the endothelial monolayer of the microvessel analogue and enters the stromal compartment by diffusion. Scale bars are 50\u00a0\u00b5m. (D) Changes in fluorescence intensity within the stromal compartment were used to calculate apparent vascular permeability of vessels in the presence of conditioned media (CM) or co-cultured with CAFs\u2014with and without Cxcl12 gene deletion. Reported values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, with n \u2265 3 biological replicates and at least 15 apertures analyzed for each condition: *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p < 0.001.The presence of the chemokine CXCL12 from f/f; PyT CAFs significantly increased the vascular permeability of endothelial microvessel analogues approximately 5-fold in both conditioned media and the co-culture model: means of 5.7 and 5.2 \u00d7 10\u20137\u00a0cm/s, respectively, compared to the control arm of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u20137\u00a0cm/s (Figure 2D). Given that the values from CM and co-culture models were not significantly different from each other, the presence of CAFs and soluble CXCL12 did not appear to have an additive effect on permeability. In the absence of CXCL12 from CAFs with the fibroblast-specific CXCL12 deletion (\u0394/\u0394; PyT), conditioned media did not have a significant effect on vessel permeability compared to control. Notably, conditioned media from CAFs contains a vast myriad of growth factors, cytokines, and other extracellular matrix protein constituents of the CAF secretome. Therefore, the principal difference between \u0394/\u0394; PyT conditioned media and f/f; PyT conditioned media is the absence of fibroblast-derived CXCL12. Consequently, soluble CXCL12 can be attributed as a primary driver of this observed rise in vascular permeability operating through a paracrine signaling axis between CAFs and nearby endothelia.Interestingly, apparent permeability significantly increased approximately 3-fold in the CXCL12-depleted CAF co-culture model (\u0394/\u0394; PyT), with a mean of 3.0 \u00d7 10\u20137\u00a0cm/s, compared to control. This suggests that despite the absence of soluble CXCL12, CAFs are capable of augmenting vessel permeability within the local tumor microenvironment through other means, for example, indirectly through ECM remodeling or TME reprogramming. Of note, CAFs are known to produce excess collagen leading to increased matrix density, desmoplasia, and tissue stiffness. A highly fibrotic tumor can also cause immunosuppression by excluding T lymphocytes through various mechanisms, and thus promotes tumor survival. In addition, tissue stiffness has been shown to promote a leakier tumor-like vasculature and angiogenesis, thereby suggesting an interplay between fibroblast contractility, matrix stiffness, and an altered vascular phenotype. These findings prompted us to investigate the autocrine signaling effect of CXCL12 on fibroblasts\u2019 ability to remodel the ECM. Namely, the contractility of fibroblasts\u2014both CAFs and mouse mammary fibroblasts (MMF) from normal glands\u2014on type I collagen was investigated (Figure 3).Collagen gel contraction assay to determine fibroblast contractility. (A) Percent contraction of normal mouse mammary gland fibroblasts (f/f) and CAFs (f/f; PyT) harvested from PyT tumor-induced mice, with and without the pharmacological CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100 (AMD). CAFs exhibit greater contractility compared to their normal counterparts by 48\u00a0h. AMD did not have a statistically significant effect on fibroblast contraction, although a slight reduction in mean contraction is observed for both cell lines. Reported values represent the mean \u00b1 standard deviation, with n = 4 technical replicates for each condition: *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, ***p < 0.001. (B) Representative images of fibroblast-laden collagen gels under stereo microscope after 72\u00a0h of contraction. Scale bar is 2\u00a0mm.CXCL12-mediated fibroblast remodeling of the ECM In vitro collagen gel contraction assays were performed for MMFs and CAFs harvested from their respective mice models in the presence and absence of AMD3100 (AMD). AMD3100, a pharmaceutical also known as plerixafor, is a highly selective antagonist to the CXCR4 receptor, thus, it directly competes with endogenous CXCL12. The pharmacological blocking of soluble CXCL12 was used to disrupt the autocrine signaling axis of CXCL12 secreted by both normal fibroblasts and CAFs. Collagen hydrogels contracted more than 55% after 24\u00a0h for both CAF and MMF conditions confirming the ability of these fibroblasts to contract ECM in vitro (Figure 3A). While contractility increased for all four conditions over 3\u00a0days, CAFs exhibited significantly greater contractility compared to their normal counterparts by Day 2 lasting through the duration of the assay (Figure 3B). By Day 3, mean contraction for CAF-laden gels had reached 88 and 89%, with and without AMD, respectively. By contrast, normal mammary fibroblasts contracted 66 and 69%, with and without AMD, respectively. Overall, AMD3100 did not have a statistically significant effect on fibroblast contraction, although, a modest drop in mean contraction was observed for both cell lines. As a result, the antagonistic blocking of autocrine CXCL12 by AMD3100 does not significantly affect fibroblasts\u2019 ability to remodel the local ECM. The primary upstream trigger of CAF contractility is likely not CXCL12, such that autocrine effects of CXCL12 are probably not responsible for making fibroblasts substantially more contractile. Taken together, CXCL12 from CAFs increases the permeability of surrounding microvessel analogues\u2014which has implications for tumor intravasation and metastasis\u2014however, CXCL12 does not seem to play a major role in the ECM remodeling of CAFs by autocrine control.ConclusionStromal CXCL12 secreted by CAFs has a potent effect on increasing the vascular permeability of local blood microvessels through paracrine signaling of the chemokine. A leakier endothelium is of particular importance given its role in angiogenesis and intravasation by tumor cells within the broader context of the metastatic cascade. Furthermore, co-culture with CAFs that had a CXCL12-specific genetic ablation resulted in a reduction of vascular permeability compared to CXCL12-secreting CAFs\u2014presumably through indirect matrix remodeling. Despite CAF-secreted CXCL12 promoting tumor-like vasculature, CXCL12 does not appear to control fibroblast contractility through upstream autocrine signaling mechanisms.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusion of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Author contributionsDesign and conceptualization of the study: JCH, C-WC, AA, DKA, RKG, and JWS.

        "content": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis. An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration.

An important step in the shift to a pro-cancerous microenvironment is the transformation of normal stromal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs are present in a majority of solid tumors and can directly promote tumor cell motility via cytokine, chemokine and growth factor secretion into the TME. The exact effects that the TME has upon cytoskeletal regulation in motile tumor cells remain enigmatic. The conserved formin family of cytoskeleton regulating proteins plays an essential role in the assembly and/or bundling of unbranched actin filaments. Mammalian Diaphanous-related formin 2 (mDia2/DIAPH3/Drf3/Dia) assembles a dynamic F-actin cytoskeleton that underlies tumor cell migration and invasion. We therefore sought to understand whether CAF-derived chemokines impact breast tumor cell motility through modification of the formin-assembled F-actin cytoskeleton. In MDA-MB-231 cells, conditioned media (CM) from WS19T CAFs, a human breast tumor-adjacent CAF line, significantly and robustly increased wound closure and invasion relative to normal human mammary fibroblast (HMF)-CM. WS19T-CM also promoted proteasome-mediated mDia2 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to control HMF-CM and WS21T CAF-CM, a breast CAF cell line that failed to promote robust MDA-MB-231 migration. Cytokine array analysis of CM identified up-regulated secreted factors in WS19T relative to control WS21T CM. We identified CXCL12 as a CM factor influencing loss of mDia2 protein while increasing MDA-MB-231 cell migration. Our data suggest a mechanism whereby CAFs promote tumor cell migration and invasion through CXCL12 secretion to regulate the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton in breast tumor cells.IntroductionApproximately 90% of cancer-related deaths are due to advanced metastatic disease. In metastatic breast cancer, invasive primary tumor cells can migrate to regional lymph nodes en route to frequently colonized secondary sites such as bone, liver, brain, lungs, and other tissues. During metastatic dissemination, tumor cells take cues from their local environment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a heterogeneous and diverse population of cells surrounding tumors. It is comprised of stromal cells (i.e., endothelial cells, tumor associated macrophages (TAMs)), carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), individual tumor cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In breast cancer, connective tissue and glandular structures are transformed into this cancer-promoting microenvironment. Specifically, CAFs have been implicated in cancer progression due to their innate ability to secrete pro-tumorigenic factors into the TME. In particular, cytokines and chemokines increase cancer cell proliferation, migration/invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, TGF-\u03b2 has a well-established role in fibroblast activation and subsequent conversion to a CAF phenotype. In a breast cancer model, primary macrophages increased transendothelial migration of primary breast cancer xenografts mediated by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and increased expression of CSF-1 receptor on tumor cells. In order to target this pro-tumorigenic region and inhibit TME:tumor cell reciprocal signaling, we must first identify proteins underlying TME-driven tumor cell invasion.During metastatic dissemination, tumor cells must first escape the primary tumor and invade through the adjacent ECM and TME. Tumor cells possess a dynamic cytoskeleton which allows them to shift between different motility programs and regulate actin-rich protrusive structures that promote cell motility in response to environmental cues within the TME. For instance, soluble factors from breast cancer cells upregulated the oncoprotein YAP in adjacent fibroblasts which in turn increased actin cytoskeleton contractility and created a self-sustaining, activated CAF phenotype with enhanced secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors. In a pancreatic cancer model, CAFs expressing high levels of the cytoskeletal protein palladin showed increased Cdc42-dependent matrix remodeling that promoted invadopodia formation.The microtubule and actin cytoskeleton are regulated, in part, by the conserved mammalian diaphanous-related (mDia1-3) formin family of cytoskeleton proteins. This family of autoregulated proteins polymerizes, and, in some cases, bundles linear filamentous actin (F-actin), and stabilizes microtubules. As mDia formins nucleate and polymerize actin, force is generated by these newly synthesized filaments and this force deforms the cell membrane, creating protrusive structures underlying cell migration and invasion. These structures include spike-like filopodia, broad sheet-like lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, invadopodia, and non-apoptotic membrane blebs.mDia formins are regulated through autoinhibition. Autoinhibited mDia proteins exist in a closed or inactive confirmation by an interaction between the Dia inhibitory domain (DID) and the Dia-autoregulatory domain (DAD), which inhibits the functional FH2 domain from associating with actin. Autoinhibition is released when a GTP-bound Rho-GTPase binds to the GTPase binding domain (GBD), thereby disrupting the DID-DAD interaction and releasing the protein into an open, functional confirmation. In addition to cell motility, formins also play a role in cytokinesis, vesicular transport, and transcriptional regulation. Formin dysregulation can therefore underlie various pathologies. DIAPH1 (encoding mDia1) knockout mice had reduced T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs and T cell:ECM adhesion and migration were inhibited. Loss of mDia1 also impacts other immune cells. DIAPH1 knockout, in conjunction with WASP knockout resulted in defective neutrophil polarization and chemotaxis. Loss of mDia1 expression and function was shown to underlie myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic syndromes.mDia formins were identified as potential therapeutic targets to block tumor cell motility and invasion. Indeed, mDia1 functions in a feedback loop to stimulate mDia1, LARG, RhoA signaling, which in turn modulates cancer cell morphology and invasion. mDia1 was shown to be important for lamellae and filopodia formation following EGF stimulation in MTln3 breast adenocarcinoma cells. mDia1-3 were shown to be important for invadopodia formation and subsequent matrix degradation. mDia2, which is encoded by DIAPH3, increased invasive cell egress from epithelial ovarian cancer spheroids. Functional inhibition of mDia2 through association with its negative regulator, Dia-interacting protein (DIP), caused non-apoptotic blebbing, a hallmark of amoeboid motility in breast tumor cells. Conversely, mDia2 activation using small molecule agonists inhibited glioblastoma invasion and migration both in vitro and ex vivo. Thus, the role of mDia proteins within different tumor microenvironments is likely complex and dictated by specific environmental cues.In this study, we sought to understand how CAF-soluble factors affect the mDia-directed F-actin cytoskeleton in MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Here we demonstrated conditioned media (CM) from WS19T breast tumor-adjacent CAFs significantly increases MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell migration and invasion, and is correlated with significant loss of mDia2 protein expression through a proteasomal-dependent mechanism. DIAPH3 expression was not diminished in response to CAF-CM treatment. Finally, we determined by membrane-based cytokine array that stromal-secreted CXCL12 is a significantly upregulated component of CAF-CM that underlies mDia2 loss in MDA-MB-231 cells and the resultant increase in cell migration.Methods and materialsCell lines, chemicals, and reagentsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were from ATCC (CRM-HTB-26). Human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) were a kind gift from Dr. Saori Furuta (University of Toledo, Toledo, OH and originally acquired from ScienCell Research Laboratories). WS19T and WS21T human breast carcinoma-associated fibroblasts were kind gifts from Dr. Julie Boerner (Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI), and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were kind gifts from Dr. Kandace Williams (University of Toledo, Toledo, OH) and were originally acquired from ATCC (CRL-1658). MCF10A (CRL-10317) and MCF7 (HTB-22) cells were purchased from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 cells, WS19T and WS21T fibroblasts, and NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS (vol/vol), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. HMFs were maintained in ScienCell fibroblast media, 2% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution, and 1% of fibroblast growth supplement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in a humidified environment.Anti-mDia2, -mDia1, -ROCK1, -\u03b2-catenin, and -GAPDH polyclonal rabbit antibodies were from Proteintech and were used at 1:200 dilutions for immunofluorescence and 1:2,000 for western blotting. Anti-RhoA mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Cytoskeleton (1:1,000 dilution). Anti-tubulin rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Abcam (1:10,000 dilution). Alexa-Fluor secondary goat anti-rabbit conjugated antibodies were from Invitrogen and were used at 1:200 for immunofluorescence.Lactacystin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 10 \u03bcM in dH2O with 16h treatment. Vehicle treatments were equal volumes. SMIFH2 in DMSO (EMD Biochemicals; Tocris Bioscience, Avonmouth) was used at 10\u201340 \u03bcM with 16h for wound closure assays and 8-72h for western blot analysis. Cycloheximide in dH2O was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used at 10 \u03bcg/ml for 1-24h. CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1 in dH2O (R&D Systems) was used at 15\u2013100 ng/ml for 16h for wound closure assays and 8-72h for western blot analysis.siRNA transfections were performed as previously described.Western blottingWhole cell lysates were collected with lysis buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, glycerol, 10% SDS (wt/vol), 0.1% bromophenol blue (wt/vol) supplemented with 0.1M diothiothreitol (DTT)) and SDS-PAGE was performed to resolve proteins. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes using a BioRad Trans-Blot turbo transfer system. Western blots were exposed using Clarity Western ECL (BioRad) and Alpha Innotech imaging system (Azure Biosystems). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software.Conditioned media preparationHuman mammary, NIH-3T3, WS19T, and WS21T fibroblasts were plated in DMEM growth media, in T-75 culture flasks, and grown to confluence. Media were removed 5 days post-confluence, centrifuged at 1000 rpm to remove cellular debris, and stored at -20\u00b0C until use.Wound healing assaysConfluent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in 6-well culture plates were scratched with a sterile pipette tip, followed by 16h incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Immediately following scratching, media were changed to either DMEM, HMF-CM, WS19T-CM or WS21T-CM. Image acquisition occurred at introduction of the scratch (0h) and 16h post scratching. \u201cWounds\u201d were measured using MetaMorph Image Analysis software to determine percent wound closure. Each condition was performed in triplicate within a single experiment and with a minimum of three experimental repeats.Spheroid formationSpheroids were generated using centrifugation and poly-HEMA coated, low attachment plates as previously described. Coated wells in a 96-well culture plate were seeded with 4,000 cells suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS supplemented with 2.5% of 15\u03bcl/ml matrigel (BD Biosciences). Cells were pelleted at 1,000xg for 2m. Spheroids were grown for 72h prior to the start of all assays.Spheroid invasion assayCollagen-1 (BD Biosciences) was used at a concentration of 2mg/ml and prepared as previously described (modified from). 8-well chamber slides (LabTek) were coated with a thin layer of the diluted collagen, spheroids were added in 15\u03bcl of media and a thin collagen layer was added on top of the initial collagen layer and spheroid. Slides were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45m to allow for polymerization prior to adding media. Serum-free media (SFM), full growth media (DMEM containing 10% FBS), HMF-CM, or WS19T-CM was used per 8-well slide. Spheroids were imaged upon embedding and 24, 48h, and 72h post-embedding. Media were refreshed every 24h. MetaMorph image analysis software was used to determine the area of each spheroid by drawing a region of interest (ROI) that encompassed at least 90% of the invasion edges. Change in area was used as a measure of invasion. A single experiment included measurements from at least 8 wells of each media type and the experiment was repeated three times.RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCRRNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was generated using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was completed using Radiant SYBR Green Lo-ROX PCR mix (Alkali Scientific) and an Applied Biosystems 7500 PCR system. Analysis was performed on SDS software as previously described. The average Ct values for tested (DIAPH3) and housekeeping genes (GAPDH and cyclophilin B) were calculated from the individual Ct values generated from the PCR reaction. The average Ct values for the experimental housekeeping genes were subtracted from the tested experimental values for the \u0394Ct experimental. The average Ct values for the control housekeeping genes were subtracted from the control experimental values for the \u0394Ct control. The \u0394Ct control was then subtracted from the \u0394Ct experimental to produce the \u0394\u0394Ct. The final step of analysis is calculating the expression fold change (fold change = 2-\u0394\u0394Ct). Primers for DIAPH3, PPIB (encoding cyclophilin B), and GAPDH were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and used at concentrations following the Radiant protocol. DIAPH3 mRNA levels were normalized to cyclophilin B and GAPDH mRNAs for analysis. Primer sequences were as follows: PPIB (5\u2019-CAT CTG CAC TGC CAA GAC TGA-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TTG CCA AAC ACC ACA TGC TT-3\u2019), GAPDH (5\u2019- GCC TCA AGA TCA TCA GCA ATG C-3\u2019 and 5\u2019 CCA CGA TAC CAA AGT TGT CAT GG-3\u2019) and DIAPH3 (5\u2019-GCG GGA AAA GGA CTT CAG TAT-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-TCT GTC GGC TTC TCT TAA GAC TTC-3\u2019), and were previously validated and confirmed using BLAST.Proliferation assayMTT (Biosynth International) cell viability assay was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. Metabolic activity was assessed at 16, 24, 48, and 72h. Within a single experiment each condition and time point included nine measurements and the experiment was repeated thrice.Immunofluorescence (IF)Sterile coverslips were coated with 10\u03bcg/ml of Collagen-1 at 37\u00b0C overnight. Cells plated on collagen-coated coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with a primary antibody against mDia2 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Alexa-Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen), Alexa-594 phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and DAPI (Invitrogen) were applied at 37\u00b0C for 1.5h.Cytokine antibody arrayCustom cytokine antibody arrays were from RayBiotech (S1 Table). The assay was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, treated membranes were exposed using the Alpha Innotech chemilluminescence imaging system (Azure Biosystems). Quantification was performed using ImageJ software and analysis was performed with the RayBiotech analysis software. Background measurements were subtracted and values were normalized to the corresponding target incubated with HMF-CM. WS19T and WS21T-CM were screened three times with each target spotted in duplicate per membrane (S2 Table). Control HMF-CM was screened twice with each target spotted in duplicate per membrane.Human CXCL12/SDF1-\u03b1 ELISAA human CXCL12/SDF1-\u03b1 ELISA kit was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The assay was performed following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The provided standard was performed in triplicate. HMF-CM, WS19T-CM, and WS21T-CM were screened in three independent CM sample collections, collected as previously described. Each collection included parallel HMF-CM, WS19T-CM, and WS21T-CM sample. HMF-CM samples were in duplicate, while WS19T-CM and WS21T-CM were assessed in triplicate. Assays were read at 450nm absorbance using a SpectraMax plate reader and results were plotted with SigmaPlot software.Statistical analysisOne-tail Student\u2019s t-tests were used with a 95% confidence interval with p < 0.05 interpreted as statistically significant. Standard deviations are shown on histograms.ResultsWS19T CAF-derived CM drives increases MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell motility in vitroGiven the notion that CAF-secreted factors promote invasion and metastasis, we hypothesized that mammary tumor-derived CAFs may influence tumor cell motility through modifying the actin cytoskeleton. We first assessed if factors present in WS19T CAF-conditioned CM altered tumor cell motility in wound healing assays. WS19T CAFs are a tumor-adjacent patient-derived mammary carcinoma associated fibroblast cell line. To assess the effects of WS19T-CM conditioned for various lengths of time upon MDA-MB-231 cell motility, wound closure assays were performed using WS19T-CM collected 1-5d post confluency. Confluent cell monolayers were \u201cscratched\u201d (T0) and allowed to fill in the \u201cwound\u201d for 16h. MDA-MB-231 cell wound closure increased in a time -dependent manner in CM collected at 3, 4, and 5d post-confluency, with greatest wound closure in 5d CM (S1 Fig). Therefore, 5d WS19T-CM was used for all subsequent experiments.We next assessed the specificity of CAF-CM in MDA-MB-231 cell wound closure assays performed for 16h in the presence of CAF-CM or control CM from normal fibroblasts and additional breast tumor-adjacent CAFs. MDA-MB-231 cells and WS19T CAFs alone had 51% and 32% wound closure, respectively, while co-plating MDA-MB-231 cells and (1:1 ratio) resulted in 81% wound closure (Fig 1A and 1B). However, MDA-MB-231 cells cultured alone in WS19T-CM (conditioned for 5d post-CAF confluency) had 100% wound closure (Fig 1A and 1B). MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in NIH-3T3-CM or HMF-CM, derived from normal human mammary fibroblasts, showed no significant increases in percent wound closure relative to MDA-MB-231 cells wounded in DMEM (Fig 1A, 1C and 1D). CM derived from WS21T fibroblasts (derived from a patient with ER+/PR+ breast cancer, modestly increased motility (~64%) in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to control MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM, yet not as robustly as WS19T-CM (100%) (Fig 1A and 1E).WS19T carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and WS19T-CM significantly increase MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cell motility.A-E. MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells, WS19T CAFs, and MDA-MB-231 cells + WS19T CAFs co-culture (1:1 ratio) were plated and grown to confluency. Wound closures were also assessed over 16h in the presence of DMEM growth media, NIH 3T3-CM, HMF-CM, WS19T-CM, or WS21T-CM. For B, *p<0.001; **p<0.03 relative to DMEM control. For E, *p<0.008 relative to DMEM control. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated thrice. Scale bars = 1000\u03bcm.To assess specificity of CAF-CM upon tumor cell motility, we incubated a panel of normal breast and transformed breast and non-breast tumor cell lines with WS19T-CM. WS19T-CM incubation with MCF-10A and MCF7 cells did not increase MCF-10A motility but did significantly increase MCF-7 motility indicating responsiveness in malignant cells (S2 Fig). Furthermore, when WS19T-CM was applied to the U251 glioblastoma and OVCA429 ovarian cancer cell lines in wound closure assays (S2 Fig), we did not observe significant increases in motility suggesting that breast tumor CAF-secreted factors might be tissue-specific or different concentration requirements drive progression in different tissues of origin.WS19T-CM reduces MDA-MB-231 cell proliferationTo validate that increased wound closure throughout 16h was not due to increased cell proliferation, we analyzed the effects of WS19T-CM on MDA-MB-231 proliferation using MTT and cell counting assays. Interestingly, WS19T-CM reduced MDA-MB-231 metabolic activity (Fig 2A) by 55\u201385% through 72h of WS19T-CM incubation relative to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM. We then manually counted cells incubated in DMEM growth media or WS19T-CM. We plated 50,000 cells and assessed growth ever 24h through 72h. MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of WS19T-CM still proliferated, but did so at a modest yet significantly decreased rate (~2,678 cells/h) compared to the corresponding DMEM-treated cells (~3,125 cells/h) (Fig 2B). Therefore, increased MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation does not account for increased wound closure in response to WS19T-CM.WS19T-CM reduces MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation.A. MTT analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells + DMEM or WS19T-CM for 16-72h. *p<0.0001 relative to DMEM at the corresponding time point. B. 50,000 MDA-MB-231 cells were initially plated into DMEM or WS19T-CM and grown through 72h, manually counting at the indicated time points. *p<0.0001 relative to DMEM control at the corresponding time point. Three independent experiments each consisting of nine replicates per condition.WS19T\u2013CM increases MDA-MB-231 cell invasion in a 3D collagen matrixWe next assessed whether WS19T-CM affected MDA-MB-231 cell invasion. MDA-MB-231 spheroids were formed for 72h, embedded in 2mg/ml Type-1 collagen gels, and allowed to invade for an additional 72h (Fig 3A). Embedded spheroids incubated with serum-free medium (SFM), control HMF-derived CM, and DMEM growth media showed moderate invasion through 72h (Fig 3A and 3B). Spheroids embedded with WS19T-CM showed significantly increased invasion compared to controls at corresponding culture times through 72h invasion. Thus, CAF-CM increases MDA-MB-231 motility in both 2D and 3D environments.WS19T-CM increases MDA-MB-231 tumor cell invasion.A. Representative images from MDA-MB-231 spheroids embedded in 2 mg/ml Type 1 collagen and incubated with DMEM growth media or WS19T-CM through 72h. Scale bars = 1000 \u03bcm. B. MDA-MB-231 spheroids were embedded in collagen and incubated with serum-free media (SFM), human mammary fibroblast-CM (HMF), DMEM + 10% FBS (DMEM), or WS19T-CM (CM). The area of each spheroid was measured at the time of embedding (T0) and at the indicated time points. Data are expressed as change in area relative to T0. Each condition was performed in triplicate and repeated thrice. *p<0.0001; **p<0.03; ***p<0.003.WS19T-CM decreases mDia2 protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cellsmDia formins assemble non-branched actin filaments that underlie protrusive structures in motile tumor cells. We next assessed mDia protein expression in 2D in response to CAF-CM, along with RhoA, an upstream activator effecting both mDia and ROCK signaling. In MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in WS19T-CM for 8-72h, mDia2 protein expression significantly decreased within 8h of WS19T-CM treatment relative to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM growth media (Fig 4A and 4B) and inhibition was sustained through 72h. RhoA, ROCK and mDia1 protein levels remained relatively unchanged when compared to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM (Fig 4A). In 3D, MDA-MB-231 spheroids first formed in DMEM and then cultured in WS19T-CM showed >75% loss of mDia2 expression relative to control spheroids formed in DMEM (D) and/or DMEM-treated (D+D) spheroids (Fig 4C and 4D). Western blot analysis of HMF-CM, NIH 3T3-CM, and WS21T-CM treated MDA-MB-231 cells in 2D cultures showed no detectable mDia2 or mDia1 protein expression changes through 72h relative to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM (Fig 4E\u20134G).WS19T-CM reduces mDia2 protein expression.A. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in monolayers with WS19T-CM for 8-72h and western blotted for the indicated proteins. B. Densitometry was performed on A using Image J and mDia2 expression was normalized to GAPDH and compared to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM. *p<0.001 relative to DMEM (0h). C. MDA-MB-231 cells spheroids were cultured in WS19T-CM for 48-72h and cell lysates were blotted for the indicated proteins. Mono = MDA-MB-231 monolayer lysate. The DMEM condition were cells held in DMEM for the duration of the experiment. The D/D condition are cells that were plated in DMEM and underwent a media change at the same time point as the CM condition but was changed back into DMEM. D. Densitometry was performed on C using Image J with mDia2 expression normalized to GAPDH and compared to MDA-MB-231 spheroids in DMEM. *p<0.004 relative to DMEM. Each experiment was repeated thrice. E-G. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in monolayers with HMF-CM, 3T3-CM, or WS21T-CM for 8-72h and western blotted for the indicated proteins.WS19T-CM mediated mDia2 protein expression loss is recoverableKinetic washout assays were performed to evaluate if mDia2 loss in response to WS19T-CM was recoverable (Fig 5). MDA-MB-231 cells were first incubated in either DMEM growth media or WS19T-CM for 8h. The respective media were then washed out and replaced with DMEM growth media. mDia2 protein was re-expressed as early as 1h after the CM-washout (dark grey vs. light grey bars, Fig 5B). Levels approached DMEM control levels (white bars) by 2h post washout. mDia1 protein levels remained relatively unchanged with time (Fig 5A and 5B) in the presence of WS19T-CM and throughout the washout.WS19T-mediated mDia2 loss is recoverable upon washout.A. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in DMEM with no media change (DMEM), WS19T-CM (CM), or DMEM with a media refresh of DMEM (D/D) for 8h. Cells in WS19T-CM were then released into DMEM after the 8h incubation. Western blots were performed on cell lysates for the indicated proteins. B. Densitometry was performed on A using Image J with mDia2 expression normalized to GAPDH and compared to DMEM. *p<0.03 relative to DMEM. The experiment was performed in quadruplicate.WS19T-CM does not affect mDia2 mRNA levelsTo determine if mDia2 expression loss is at the level of the mDia2 mRNA, qRT-PCR was performed with primers recognizing DIAPH3 or control genes encoding cyclophilin B (PPIB) or GAPDH. MDA-MB-231 control and DIAPH3 mRNA levels were assessed after 8-72h of WS19T-CM treatment (Fig 6), paralleling mDia2 protein expression (Fig 4). DIAPH3 levels remained statistically unchanged when normalized to PPIB or GAPDH mRNA, compared to the corresponding DMEM treatment time points (Fig 6A and 6B). Thus, WS19T-CM regulates mDia2 protein expression and not DIAPH3 mRNA levels.WS19T-CM does not decrease mDia2 mRNA levels.A. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for the indicated times with either DMEM growth media or WS19T CM, and qRT-PCR performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as expression fold change (2-\u0394\u0394Ct) relative to A. cyclophilin B (PPIB) or B. GAPDH. No significant differences were observed. The experiment was performed 4 times.mDia functional inhibition does not affect mDia2 protein levels or cell motilitymDia2 functional inhibition using the small molecule inhibitor of FH2 domain, SMIFH2, resulted in loss of mDia2 protein in U2OS cells within 2-16h, and within 5h in HEK 293T, A375, and MDA-MB-231 cells through an unidentified non-proteasomal mechanism of protein degradation. SMIFH2 functionally inhibits the FH2 domain of mDia formins and prevents F-actin nucleation, decreases formin affinity for the barbed end of F-actin, and reduces F-actin elongation. We assessed whether mDia functional inhibition decreased mDia2 protein expression. We first validated the functionality of the SMIFH2 used in these studies by assessing induction of non-apoptotic plasma membrane blebs in MDA-MB-231 cells, a functional consequence we previously observed. Indeed, 10\u03bcM SMIFH2 induced robust blebbing, confirming functionality of individual lots of SMIFH2 (data not shown). MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 40\u03bcM SMIFH2 for 8-72h revealed no loss of mDia2 protein expression compared to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM and DMSO-treated cells (Fig 7A and 7B). In our system, cell motility was unaffected upon mDia2 functional suppression, with no significant difference in percent wound closure between DMEM- and SMIFH2-treated cells (Fig 7C) after 16h.mDia2 functional inhibition does not affect mDia2 protein expression.A. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown to 60% confluency and treated with vehicle (DMSO) or 40\u03bcM SMIFH2 for 1-16h prior to lysate collection and Western blotting. B. Densitometry from A. where mDia2 was normalized to GAPDH and compared relative to DMEM. C. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 40\u03bcM SMIFH2 starting at T0 continuously for 16h during a wound closure experiment. Experiments were repeated thrice.WS19T-CM reduces mDia2 protein expression through a proteasome-dependent mechanismWe next sought to understand mechanisms whereby mDia2 protein expression is lost in MDA-MB-231 cells in response to WS19T-CM. We first utilized cycloheximide to determine the half-life of mDia2 in culture and compare to WS19T-CM-affected mDia2 expression kinetics. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 10\u03bcg/mL of cycloheximide yielded an mDia2 half-life of 5.6h (Fig 8A and 8B). When MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with WS19T-CM for the same time course, mDia2 half-life decreases to 3.9h. This shortened mDia2 half-life in the presence of WS19T-CM supports the notion of a mechanism other than the normal turnover of mDia2 protein is at play in response to WS19T-CM in MDA-MB-231 cells.WS19T-CM mediated mDia2 loss is proteasome-dependent.A. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 10\u03bcg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) or WS19T-CM for 1-24h. Cell lysates assessed by Western blotting. mDia2 expression was normalized to GAPDH of the respective 0h condition and compared to mDia2 expression at the respective 0h condition. B. Normalized mDia2 expression was graphed versus time. A fit line was generated and the resulting equation was used for extrapolating unknown values. All experiments were repeated thrice. C. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown to 60% confluency. Cells were incubated in DMEM, vehicle (water), WS19T-CM (CM), lactacystin (Lact or L), or WS19T-CM+ lactacystin (Lact+CM, L+CM) for 16h prior to cell lysate collection and Western blotting. D. Densitometry was performed on C, where mDia2 expression was normalized to GAPDH expression and compared relative to MDA-MB-231 cells in full DMEM. *p<0.01 compared to DMEM. E. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated as in C. at T0h continuously for 16h during a wound closure experiment.mDia2 protein expression during the cell cycle is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. mDia2 is expressed in S-and G2/M phase with a significant drop following progression into G0/G1 phase. This marked drop is due to poly-ubiquitination followed by degradation. We next assessed whether proteasomal-mediated degradation of mDia2 is initiated by CAF-CM factors. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin for 16h in the presence of DMEM or WS19T-CM and mDia2 protein expression was evaluated. Neither vehicle-treated nor proteasome inhibitor-treated MDA-MB-231 cells showed loss of mDia2 protein expression when cultured in DMEM (Fig 8C and 8D). Proteasome inhibition in the presence of WS19T-CM restored mDia2 protein expression to that of DMEM and vehicle control levels. Proteasome inhibition also inhibited CM-mediated motility (via wound closure) to levels comparable to MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in DMEM (Fig 8E).WS19T-CM does not affect mDia2 localizationmDia2 protein expression is lost in the presence of WS19T-CM, and is followed by the quick recovery of mDia2 expression upon WS19T-CM washout. To examine if changes in intracellular protein localization underlie mDia2 recovery, we visualized mDia2 localization in MDA-MB-231 cells incubated in DMEM, HMF-CM, NIH-3T3-CM, WS21T-CM, and WS19T-CM. Compared to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM, the percentages of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic mDia2 were not changed in response to either HMF-CM, NIH-3T3-CM, and WS19T-CM (S3 Fig). Thus, intracellular sequestration does not appear to be a mechanism impacting mDia2 protein expression and/or recovery in our system.WS19T-CM contains up-regulated, cancer-associated cytokinesTo characterize factors present in WS19T-CM that underlie enhanced MDA-MB-231 cell motility and/or loss of mDia2 expression, we performed a cytokine array analysis. HMF-CM, WS19T-CM, and WS21T-CM were applied to cytokine arrays assessing 28 target proteins (S1 Table). HMF-CM was used as a control for baseline levels of these targets in a non-cancerous stromal population and as HMF-CM promoted neither MDA-MB-231 migration nor influenced mDia2 expression. Cytokine targets were chosen based on known CAF-secreted factors and tumor-promoting factors. Cytokines of interest were identified by up-regulation in WS19T-CM arrays relative to WS21T-CM arrays to identify factors with potential to differentially affect MDA-MB-231 cell motility and reduce mDia2 protein expression. TGF\u03b1, PDGF, IL-17, TNF-\u03b2 MMP-13, and CXCL12 all showed dramatically increased expression in the WS19T-CM compared to WS21T-CM (Fig 9A and 9B and S2 Table).WS19T-CM upregulates a panel of cancer-associated cytokines.A. Conditioned media from HMF, WS21T CAFs, and WS19T CAFs were analyzed using membrane-based cytokine antibody arrays. Samples were assessed in duplicate. The experiment was repeated three times. B. Densitometry of WS19T-CM and WS21T-CM treated cytokine membranes were normalized to HMF-CM.Upregulated cytokines were then prioritized based on previous connections to both cancer progression (i.e., motility, invasion and metastasis) and the F-actin cytoskeleton. CXCL12, PDGF, and TGF\u03b1 were further identified as our top three prioritized hits. CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 were implicated in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis through formation of chemotactic gradients. PDGF signaling regulated actin dynamics through various downstream effectors (reviewed in). TGF\u03b1 increased motility in MDA-MB-231 cells and upregulation was correlated with more aggressive cases of gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.CXCL12 is a key effector in WS19T-mediated MDA-MB-231 cell motilityWe initially focused upon CXCL12 and its role in promoting MDA-MB-231 invasion and in regulating mDia2 expression. We first evaluated the physiological levels of CXCL12 within our CM panel via CXCL12/SDF1-\u03b1 ELISA. We assessed CXCL12 levels in HMF-CM, WS19T-CM, and WS21T-CM. Within HMF-CM, WS21T-CM, and WS19T-CM, CXCL12 levels were measured at ~10.5, 31.0, and 136 pg/mL, respectively (Fig 10A). We therefore observed the highest level of CXCL12 secretion in WS19T-CM\u2014the cell line whose CM most dramatically contributed to migration, invasion, and loss of mDia2 in MDA-MB-231 cells.CXCL12 mediates MDA-MB-231 mDia2 downregulation while cell migration.A. HMF, WS21T, and WS19T fibroblasts were plated and CM collected concurrently for each replicate. HMF-CM, WS19T-CM, and WS21T-CM from three independent collections were applied in triplicate to a CXCL12/SDF1\u03b1 ELISA assay. The experiment was repeated three times. CXCL12 levels were averaged for each CM and compared to HMF-CM. *p<0.0008 HMF-CM relative to WS21T-CM, WS21T-CM relative to WS19T-CM, and HMF-CM relative to WS19T-CM. p<0.001. B. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 15, 25, and 100ng/ml CXCL12 and wound closure assays performed for 16h. The assay performed in triplicate and repeated three times. *p<0.001 C. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 100ng/ml CXCL12 for 8-72h and cell lysates were Western blotted. mDia2 expression was normalized to GAPDH and compared to the DMEM control. The experiment was repeated three times. *p<0.01 D. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with WS19T-CM as indicated. Cells were pretreated (P) for 15m with AMD3100, and/or simultaneously and continuously (C) with AMD3100 and CM (CM) or DMEM (DM) for 16h. Cell lysates were Western blotted as indicated.To evaluate the effects of CXCL12 upon MDA-MB-231 cell migration, we performed wound closure assays in response to purified CXCL12. We treated MDA-MB-231 cells for 16h with 15, 25, and 100ng/ml CXCL12. CXCL12 treatment resulted in significantly increased wound closure relative to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM (~60% closure vs. 45% closure, respectively) (Fig 10B). Modest yet significant increases in wound closure was observed with the lower CXCL12 concentrations as well.Finally, we evaluated the effects of CXCL12 upon mDia2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 100ng/ml CXCL12 for 8-72h had significantly reduced mDia2 protein expression relative to MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM (Fig 10C). Pre-incubation (PCM) as well as continuous (CCM) treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with AMD3100, an inhibitor blocking the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, blocked WS19T-CM-mediated loss of mDia2 protein relative to DMEM growth media-treated cells, supporting a role, in part, for CXCL12 signaling and regulation of mDia2 protein expression in our system (Fig 10D).DiscussionIn this study, we discovered a role for stromal-derived CXCL12 in breast cancer migration and invasion potentially through proteasome-mediated loss of mDia2 protein expression. WS19T CAF-CM significantly increased motility and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells relative to MDA-MB-231s in DMEM growth media, or control CM. We observed concomitant and specific loss of mDia2 protein expression with incubation with WS19T CAF-CM. The stromal-derived factor CXCL12 was subsequently identified as a prominent factor enriched in WS19T CAF-CM that promoted, in part, both MDA-MB-231 cell migration, as well as loss of mDia2 protein.We show a loss of mDia2 expression with increased cell migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells in the presence of WS19T-CM. Indeed, we previously demonstrated that mDia2 expression and/or activity was involved in tumor cell motility. Sustained mDia2 activation using small molecule intramics (IMMs) reduced U87 and U251 glioblastoma invasion, while mDia2 functional inhibition promoted amoeboid motility in a MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model, and loss of mDia2 function and/or expression increased single cell dissemination in an ovarian cancer spheroid model. Furthermore, DIAPH3 expression is reduced in invasive prostate cancer and in breast and hepatocarcinoma cells. Thus, tight regulation of mDia2 (and other mDia formins) is an important factor underlying cell motility in a variety of tumor models. Until now, little was known regarding what physiological drivers impact mDia2 expression and/or function. The loss of mDia2 expression in the presence of WS19T-CM highlights a physiologically relevant source of secreted factors targeting and downregulating mDia2, and subsequently promoting cancer cell dissemination and invasion. Interestingly, DIAPH3 expression was decreased in micro-dissected tumor adjacent stroma derived from invasive breast carcinoma. Hence, tight regulation of DIAPH3, or mDia2 expression and/function as a mechanism to control cellular transformation and dissemination may not be employed solely by tumor cells, but by the TME cellular constituency as a whole. It must be noted that this is the first tumor cell model of mDia2 regulation in response to CAF-CM. It warrants expanding studies to additional cancer models where a role for mDia2 in tumor invasion and metastasis has been established, such as prostate, hepatocarcinoma and glioblastoma, to test the specificity of this mechanism of mDia2 dependent mode of motility regulation.We examined the effects of the SMIFH2-mediated mDia suppression in our system to evaluate if mDia functional suppression impacted mDia protein stability and/or expression. Indeed, a previous report correlated SMIFH2-mediated functional suppression with loss of mDia2 expression in select cell lines. In our system, unlike treatment with WS19T-CM, SMIFH2 treatment for 8-72h did not result in loss of mDia2 expression at specific time points, yet it did drive amoeboid conversions and non-apoptotic membrane blebbing (data not shown), as we previously demonstrated. Within a continuous 16h treatment window, however, wound closure was not impacted with SMIFH2 treatment. Cell velocities, persistence, and total distance migrated were not measured, however. These results differ from a previous report, in which MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SMIFH2 lost mDia2 protein within 5h. It is possible that due to the cyclical nature of SMIFH2 action, or lot-to-lot variability in the inhibitor, the kinetics of mDia2 expression upon SMIFH2 suppression are subtly altered in our system. Alternatively, functional suppression of mDia2 (via the SMIFH2 mechanism) is not a requisite for mDia2 protein loss. Whether functional suppression of mDia2 precedes protein loss in WS19T-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 is currently under investigation in our lab.We sought to understand whether the loss of mDia2 was at the level of gene transcription or protein stability/degradation. RT-PCR indicated that levels of DIAPH3 transcripts are unchanged in the presence of WS19T-CM. We utilized cycloheximide to determine the half-life of mDia2 in culture and compare to WS19T-CM kinetics. The mDia2 half-life in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with CM is significantly shorter than that of cycloheximide-treated cells (~3.9 vs. 5.6h, respectively). Targeting the proteasome with lactacystin both restores mDia2 expression in the presence of CM and blocked the CM-induced increase in cell motility, pointing towards a proteasome-dependent mechanism for loss of mDia2. There is evidence for linkage between mDia2 and the proteasome in tightly regulating mDia2 expression. mDia2, ubiquitin, and the proteasome were shown to directly interact yet mDia2 did not undergo proteasome-mediated degradation in a HEK 293T forced overexpression system. Conversely, mDia2 was expressed through S- and G2/M phase of cell division in HeLa cells and was highly poly-ubiquitinated at the end of M phase, followed by substantial degradation and loss of mDia2 as cells enter G0/G1 phase. Our results support these findings, and moreover, highlight physiological signals triggering mDia2 proteasomal degradation in breast tumor cells.We noted dramatic upregulation of 6 factors by cytokine array analysis of WS19T-CM, relative to HMF-CM and WS21T-CM. We prioritized factors based upon known established links with cancer cell invasion, metastatic formation, cytoskeleton regulation, or mDia formins. From those criteria, CXCL12, PDGF, and TGF-\u03b1 were our top 3 candidates, with initial focus upon CXCL12. We revealed a novel finding that purified CXCL12 promoted mDia2 loss in MDA-MB-231 cells loss through engagement of its receptor CXCR4 (Fig 10), and promoted MDA-MB-231 cell motility. These results indicate an important intersection between CXCL12 signaling and regulation of the mDia2-directed cytoskeleton driving tumor motility.CXCL12 ELISAs (Fig 10) revealed a CXCL12 average concentration within WS19T CAF-CM of >100 pg/ml. At this concentration, CXCL12 was, in part, sufficient to promote invasion and migration, as well as loss of mDia2 expression. How does this concentration compare to other studies measuring CXCL12 levels in invasive tumors? Serum CXCL12 levels in patients with esophageal cancer were measured at 1.27 ng/ml compared to 0.86 ng/ml in healthy controls, while gastric cancer tumors were approximately 3618 ng/ml compared to 1715 ng/ml in the non-cancer control group. Such substantially disparate CXCL12 values could point to distinct functions for CXCL12 in different malignancies and pathologies, as well as additive/synergistic roles for other cytokines in promoting cancer phenotypes. In our studies using purified CXCL12 in monolayer culture, higher concentrations were needed to mimic the effects of WS19T-CM upon MDA-MB-231 migration and mDia2 suppression. Within the context of WS19T CM, CXCL12, likely in conjunction with other enriched cytokines and growth factors, may underlie a more complex system to fully regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. Within the TME, differences in temporally and spatially local CXCL12 concentrations may differentially influence mDia2 loss and/or increased motility. Collectively, our study does not indicate an exclusive role for CXCL12 in promoting both mDia2 loss and tumor migration. Rather it indicates an important and likely complementary role within a milieu of various cytokines. Future experiments will focus upon the additive or possible synergistic signaling nature of CXCL12 and other cytokines in our system, such as PDGF, in driving mDia2 loss while promoting motility.In this study, we observed significant increases in breast cancer cell migration and invasion in response to CAF-conditioned media, which was accompanied by dramatic loss of mDia2 expression. We identified CXCL12 as an underlying factor within WS19T-CM that mediates, in part, these phenotypes. Previous work identified a role for exogenous CXCL12 in breast cancer motility and migration, yet the source of CXCL12 influencing tumor motility was uncertain. Here we identify for the first time a physiological source for CXCL12 in the TME- specifically from tumor-adjacent carcinoma associated fibroblasts, and reveal a unique role for the TME in directly influencing tumor cell motility through mDia formin-dependent cytoskeletal regulation. This novel mechanism is a step towards understanding the role of CAF:tumor signaling in cancer progression and identifies potential therapeutic targets that could aid in blocking metastatic dissemination and improving patient prognosis.Supporting informationReferencesThe war on cancerThe tumor microenvironment in the post-PAGET eraCrosstalk to stromal fibroblasts induces resistance of lung cancer to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitorsTGF-beta signaling in fibroblasts modulates the oncogenic potential of adjacent epitheliaCXCL8/IL-8 and CXCL12/SDF-1alpha co-operatively promote invasiveness and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancerFunctional expression of CXCR4 (CD184) on small-cell lung cancer cells mediates migration, integrin activation, and adhesion to stromal cellsInvasive breast carcinoma cells from patients exhibit MenaINV- and macrophage-dependent transendothelial migrationThe hallmarks of cancerHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe pathogenesis of cancer metastasis: the 'seed and soil' hypothesis revisitedTumour-cell invasion and migration: diversity and escape mechanismsMechanotransduction and YAP-dependent matrix remodelling is required for the generation and maintenance of cancer-associated fibroblastsPalladin promotes invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by enhancing invadopodia formation in cancer-associated fibroblastsAlberts BJ, Alexander; Lewis, Julian; Raff, Martin; Roberts, Keith; Walter, Peter.

        "content": "The interaction between cancer and its local microenvironment can determine properties of growth and metastasis. A critical component of the tumor microenvironment in this context is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), which can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. It has been hypothesized that CAF may be derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), derived from local or distant sources. However, the signaling mechanisms by which tumors and MSCs interact to promote CAF-dependent cancer growth are largely unknown. In this study with in vitro and in vivo models using MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that tumor-derived osteopontin (OPN) induces MSC production of CCL5; the mechanism involves OPN binding to integrin cell surface receptors and activator protein-1 c-jun homodimer transactivation. In a murine xenograft model, concomitant inoculation of MSC with MDA-MB231 cells induces: (i) significantly increased growth and metastasis of MB231 cells and (ii) increased MSC migration to metastatic sites in lung and liver; this mechanism is both OPN and CCL5 dependent. MSCs retrieved from sites of metastases exhibit OPN-dependent expression of the CAF markers, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, tenascin-c, CXCL12 (or stromal cell-derived factor 1) and fibroblast-specific protein-1 and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Based upon these results, we propose that tumor-derived OPN promotes tumor progression via the transformation of MSC into CAF.",

Here, the authors show that two particular subsets of cancer associated fibroblasts induce metastasis but work via distinct mechanisms including, chemokine signalling and Notch signalling.IntroductionBreast cancers (BCs) are the most frequent cancers in women worldwide. Diagnosis is mainly based on molecular subtype (Luminal A/B, HER2 and triple-negative (TN) defined according to cancer cell expression of progesterone, estrogen and HER2 receptors), tumor size and grade, as well as axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis. Most BC deaths arise from distant metastases in bone, liver and lung. LNs are first reached by tumor cells evading from primary tumors (PTs) and number of invaded LNs is a strong prognostic factor. Tumor metastasis is a multi-step process, including local invasion, intravasation, migration in blood or lymph stream, extravasation and distant organ colonization. Among others, one mechanism involves cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves TGF\u03b2 but also NOTCH and WNT signaling pathways.Tumors are complex ecologies composed of numerous cell types, which participate in tumorigenesis and modulate cancer cell invasiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant and involved in many tumor hallmarks such as angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation and metastases. In particular, CAFs are well-described to enhance tumor invasion and metastases, especially in BC. Indeed, CAFs are able to secrete factors, such as TGF\u03b2 and CXCL12, that directly stimulate cancer cell proliferation, EMT and migration. Moreover, CAFs indirectly promote tumor spread via angiogenesis induction through VEGF and IL6. Besides, CAFs can directly interact with cancer cells via heterotypic E-cadherin\u2013N-cadherin (CDH1\u2013CDH2) adhesion and drive their invasion. They remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) and produce spaces or even tracks followed by cancer cells. Recently, lung epithelial cells were shown to acquire cancer-associated parenchymal-like feature in metastatic niche.CAFs are poorly described in metastases, including axillary LN metastases, with only few studies assessing some markers, such as podoplanin (PDPN) or \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA). CAFs are known to be heterogeneous in PTs, but characterization of this heterogeneity and its link with CAF functions is still far from being understood. If the role of CAFs in tumor invasion is well established, here we investigated if and how CAF subsets act on metastatic spread. As we recently identified four CAF subsets (named CAF-S1 to -S4) in BC, we investigated CAF heterogeneity in metastatic LN and tested if one or several of these CAF subsets could be involved in BC cell spread. We show here that two particular subsets, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4, strikingly accumulate in metastatic LN and positively modulate BC cell invasion by complementary mechanisms. On the one hand, CAF-S1 induce cancer cell migration and EMT initiation in a CXCL12/TGF\u03b2-dependent manner. On the other hand, CAF-S4 contractile properties promote cancer cell motility and invasiveness in 3-dimensions (3D) through NOTCH-mediated pathways. Importantly, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 content in LN is an independent prognostic factor at diagnosis, underlining the clinical relevance of our findings.ResultsMetastatic breast cancer axillary LNs exhibit four CAF subsetsMetastatic BC LNs exhibit four CAF subsets.a Representative FACS plots showing FAP, CD29, PDPN, \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 protein levels in DAPI\u2212 EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 CD31\u2212 CD235a\u2212 cells from a primary breast tumor (PT, left) and its corresponding metastatic axillary lymph node (LN, right). b, c FlowSom trees built on CAF from LNs (b, n\u2009=\u200920) and PTs (c, n\u2009=\u200916) and annotated for each CAF marker expression.

Source data provided in Source Data file, with R scripts used.To investigate CAF heterogeneity in BC metastatic axillary LNs, we first performed multicolor flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)) on freshly resected invaded LN, with their matched PTs as controls (Supplementary Table\u00a01). We applied the same gating strategy on both tissues by first excluding debris, dead cells, doublets, hematopoietic (CD45+), epithelial (EPCAM+), endothelial (CD31+) and red blood cells (CD235a+) (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01a). We then characterized the CD45\u2212 EPCAM\u2212 CD31\u2212 CD235a\u2212 fraction enriched in fibroblasts by studying five CAF markers: FAP (fibroblast activation protein \u03b11), CD29 (Integrin \u03b21), \u03b1SMA, PDGFR\u03b2 (platelet-derived growth factor receptor-\u03b2) and PDPN (Fig.\u00a01a). On FACS data, we applied FlowSom, an unsupervised automated algorithm which orders cells according to their phenotypic similarities (Fig.\u00a01b, c). FlowSom clustered CAFs into four main branches and thus distinguished four CAF subsets (CAF-S1 to -S4) in invaded LNs (Fig.\u00a01b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01b). Four branches were also detected in corresponding PT (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01c), confirming data in breast and ovarian PT. Although expression of CD29 in CAF-S3 was slightly lower and PDGFR\u03b2 in CAF-S4 slightly higher in LNs than in PTs, systematic pairwise comparison of each CAF marker protein level between LNs and PTs showed the identification of CAF-S1, -S2, -S3 and -S4 in metastatic LNs (Fig.\u00a01d, e). Hence, these data reveal that four CAF subsets are detected in metastatic BC LNs.As normal LN structure relies on a fibroblastic network constituted by fibroblast reticular cells (FRCs) described as PDPN+ cells, we investigated the analogy between normal stromal cells and CAF subsets in LNs. Even though non-invaded LNs were hardly accessible because almost fully used for diagnosis, we had access to two non-invaded specimens (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01d), along with their matched invaded LNs. Non-invaded axillary LNs were clearly enriched in CAF-S2- and CAF-S3-like cells, while the matched invaded LNs showed a much higher proportion of CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a01f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01e). CAF-S2 and CAF-S3 subpopulations are thus detected in metastatic LNs, but also in non-invaded LNs. These results corroborated our previous data showing that CAF-S2- and CAF-S3-like cells are detected in healthy breast tissue, suggesting that these CAFs might derive from normal resident fibroblasts. In that sense, the pattern of CAF-S3 in LNs was slightly different than the one detected in PTs, as observed with CD29 staining (Fig.\u00a01b\u2013d), suggesting that normal-like CAF-S2/S3 could be more affected by their tissue of origin than CAF-S1 and CAF-S4. In contrast to CAF-S2 and CAF-S3, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 were strictly observed in invaded LNs and positively correlated with tumor cell invasion (Fig.\u00a01g). Thus, these data highlight a potential link between both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 and tumor cell invasion in LNs. In conclusion, we identified four CAF subsets in metastatic LNs defined as: CAF-S1: FAPHigh CD29Med-High \u03b1SMAHigh PDPNHigh PDGFR\u03b2High; CAF-S2: FAPNeg CD29Low \u03b1SMANeg-Low PDPNLow PDGFR\u03b2Low; CAF-S3: FAPNeg-Low CD29Med \u03b1SMANeg-Low PDPNLow PDGFR\u03b2Low-Med; CAF-S4: FAPLow-Med CD29High \u03b1SMAHigh PDPNLow PDGFR\u03b2Med. Besides, the amounts of both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets in LNs are linked to BC cell metastatic spread.CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 are the most abundant subsets in metastatic LNMetastatic LNs are enriched in CAF-S1 and CAF-S4.a Percentage (%) of stroma in invaded LN according to BC subtypes (n\u2009=\u2009124), LumA (violet), LumB (blue), HER2 (light gray), Lum B/HER2 (dark gray), TN (black). b Histological scores (H-Scores) for each CAF marker in invaded LN according to BC subtypes (n\u2009=\u2009124). c Representative images of CAF marker staining on serial LN sections (LN#1 HER2; LN#2 TN).

We analyzed invaded zones of metastatic LN, identified using EPCAM marker (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02a). We first observed that LN stroma represented around 25\u201330% of invaded areas, independently of BC subtypes (Fig.\u00a02a). We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) of five CAF markers (FAP, CD29, FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, \u03b1SMA) on serial LN sections (Fig.\u00a02b, c). Here, we replaced PDPN by FSP1 because we could not find a PDPN-specific antibody for IHC, but we verified that PDPN and FSP1 markers recognized the same cells by FACS (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02b). Histological scoring of each CAF marker demonstrated that invaded LNs from Luminal (Lum A and B) cases exhibited the lowest histological scores (H-scores) except for PDGFR\u03b2, whereas both HER2 and TN LNs showed the highest H-scores (Fig.\u00a02b, c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02c). When applying a decision tree algorithm to determine CAF subset enrichment (Fig.\u00a02d), we found that 96% of metastatic LNs showed accumulation of CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a02e). Luminal LNs were mainly enriched in CAF-S4, while HER2 and TN cases displayed both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 predominance. We observed that the median percentage of fibroblasts positive for FAP, SMA and CD29 (reflecting CAF-S1 identity) reached 75% of total CAFs in CAF-S1-enriched LNs, and that fibroblasts negative for FAP but positive for SMA and CD29 (reflecting CAF-S4 identity) reached 60% of total fibroblasts in CAF-S4-enriched LNs. We also developed an image analysis tool that combined spatial registration and computational analysis to generate maps of CAF subsets at cellular level in invaded LNs (Fig.\u00a02f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02d). Representative pictures of CAF subset maps confirmed the enrichment in CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 in invaded LNs. Interestingly, among the 124 LNs analyzed, we had access to 41 corresponding PTs (Lum A, HER2, TN) for matched analyses (Fig.\u00a02g and Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e). We found that FAP and \u03b1SMA H-scores were similar between PTs and LNs, whereas CD29 and PDGFR\u03b2 were higher and FSP1 lower in LNs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02e). When we combined H-scores using the decision tree algorithm, we found that CAF enrichments in metastatic LNs were significantly different from those in matched PTs, with a strong increase in CAF-S4 in LNs (Fig.\u00a02g). Similarly, when comparing invaded LNs to PTs (unmatched samples) from a larger BC cohort with at least one invaded LN at diagnosis (N+) (Supplementary Table\u00a02), we confirmed the accumulation of CAF-S4, the increase in CAF-S1 and the decrease in CAF-S2 and CAF-S3 in invaded LNs compared to PTs (Fig.\u00a02h). Metastatic LNs were particularly enriched in CAF-S4 compared to PTs in Luminal A and TN subtypes (Fig.\u00a02i), possibly because HER2 PTs exhibited already high CAF-S4 content. As CAF marker H-scores were significantly correlated between PTs and LNs (FAP: r\u2009=\u20090.54, p\u2009=\u20093.10\u20134; CD29: r\u2009=\u20090.45, p\u2009=\u20093.10\u20133; FSP1: r\u2009=\u20090.52, p\u2009=\u20096.10\u20134; SMA: r\u2009=\u20090.44, p\u2009=\u20094.10\u20133 by Pearson\u2019s correlation test), we hypothesized that CAF-S1-enriched tumors could give rise to CAF-S1-enriched LNs, with similar consideration for CAF-S4. Indeed, 79% of CAF-S1-enriched PTs matched with CAF-S1-enriched LNs and 71% of CAF-S4-enriched PTs matched with CAF-S4-enriched LNs (Fig.\u00a02j) (p\u2009=\u20090.007 by Fisher's exact test). Reciprocally, CAF-S1-enriched LNs mostly matched to CAF-S1-enriched PTs (69%). In contrast, CAF-S4-enriched LNs corresponded to PTs enriched in different CAF subsets (p\u2009=\u20090.005 by Fisher's exact test), suggesting that CAF-S4 in LNs could derive from distinct CAF subsets. In conclusion, our data show that metastatic LN stroma is enriched in myofibroblastic CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets. Interestingly, CAF enrichments are different in LNs compared to PTs since LN accumulating CAF-S4 can correspond to different types of PTs that are enriched either in CAF-S4 or in inactivated CAFs (CAF-S2 or CAF-S3).CAF subsets show similar signatures between PTs and metastatic LNsCAF subsets show same identity in PTs and metastatic LNs.a PCA based on the 500 most variant genes from RNAseq data of CAF-S1, CAF-S4 and EPCAM+ cells sorted from paired PT and LN (n\u2009=\u20095 pairs for CAF-S1 and CAF-S4; n\u2009=\u20094 pairs for EPCAM+ cells). b Hierarchical clustering on the same samples and same genes as in a using Ward\u2019s method with Pearson distances.

Source data provided in Source Data file, with R scripts used.As CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets were largely predominant in LNs, we next aimed at characterizing these LN CAF subsets on a molecular basis and compared them to PT CAF subsets. CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 from both PTs and LNs (n\u2009=\u20095 pairs) were FACS-sorted by excluding dead, hematopoietic, epithelial, endothelial cells and erythrocytes and analyzing CAF markers (using the same gating strategy as in Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 fibroblasts, and EPCAM+ cancer cells sorted from PTs and matched invaded LNs (Supplementary Table\u00a01). Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC) built on the 500 most variant genes distinguished tumor cells, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a03a, b). The first PCA component (51% variance) differentiated EPCAM+ cells from CAF, and the second (23% variance) CAF-S1 from CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a03a). HC enabled us to visualize specific transcriptomic profiles (Fig.\u00a03b). PCA and HC showed that samples from PTs and LNs were mixed within each cellular population, highlighting that differences between CAF subsets (CAF-S1/CAF-S4) were higher than between tissue of origin (PT/LN). We performed PCA on each population on their respective 500 most variant genes and still noted that PT and LN samples did not segregate (Fig.\u00a03c). In line with published data, tumor cells clustered with their matched EPCAM\u2009+\u2009LN cells, suggesting that tumor cell transcriptomes vary more between patients than between PTs and LNs. In contrast, patient effect was less detectable in CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a03c). We next performed paired differential analyses of CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 considering either PT or LN samples. CAF-S1 upregulated genes were mainly involved in ECM organization and CAF-S4-specific genes in muscle contraction (Supplementary Table\u00a03 and Fig.\u00a03d). As CAF-S4 exhibited pericyte-like signature, we confirmed that we could detect MCAM-positive fibroblasts in invaded LNs (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02f), thereby confirming the existence of pericyte-like CAF and their potential pericyte origin. Moreover, there was a strong overlap between PT and LN signatures for each CAF subset (Fig.\u00a03d), suggesting that CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 from metastatic LN are molecularly close to CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 from PTs (Supplementary Tables\u00a04 and 5).CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 exhibit distinct migration and invasion propertiesCAF-S1 and CAF-S4 exhibit distinct functional features.a CAF-S1 (red) and CAF-S4 (blue) doubling time (n\u2009=\u20096). b Left, Transwell membrane underside images.

Source data provided in Source Data file, with R scripts used.As invaded LNs show predominantly CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 fibroblasts, we hypothesized they could be involved in metastatic spread and we analyzed their properties by functional assays. We established CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 primary cell cultures from BC patients. We first confirmed by RNAseq on four CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs (three couples from PTs and one from LN) that, after several passages in culture, these cells kept similar molecular identities as those detected without culture (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03a\u2013c). Moreover, we confirmed by FACS that CAF markers at protein levels corroborated data from fresh samples (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03d). We next deciphered CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 intrinsic characteristics. We first observed that CAF-S1 proliferated slightly faster than CAF-S4 (median doubling time\u2009=\u20092.1 days for CAF-S1 and 3.0 days for CAF-S4) (Fig.\u00a04a). Moreover, CAF-S1 displayed higher migration skills compared to CAF-S4, as assessed by Transwell assays (Fig.\u00a04b). We validated this result using cell exclusion zone assays by manually tracking cells and calculated their velocity, persistence and directionality. CAF-S1 were faster and more persistent than CAF-S4, CAF-S1 trajectories being more perpendicular to the edges than CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a04c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03e). We also analyzed CAF subset invasion properties in 3D. Both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets were able to form spheroids in hanging drops and to invade the surrounding matrix but CAF-S1 were more efficient in invading than CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a04d). Interestingly, on time-lapse video microscopy (Supplementary\u00a0Movies), we observed that spheroids made by CAF-S4 pulled more efficiently on collagen fibers than CAF-S1 (Fig.\u00a04e). To further quantify the traction forces exerted by CAF on matrix, we performed traction force microscopy (TFM). We observed that CAF-S1 were more elongated compared to CAF-S4 that were larger (Fig.\u00a04f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03f, h). Moreover, the strain energy (that measures the energy spent to deform the substrate) developed by CAF-S4 was more than twofold higher than that of CAF-S1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03g). To take into account differences in surface area between CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a03h), we compared the strain energy densities (strain energy normalized to the cell surface) and confirmed that CAF-S4 deployed more contractile energy per surface unit than CAF-S1 (Fig.\u00a04g). Similar results were obtained using mean traction stress amplitude (mechanical forces cell develop per unit area to deform the substrate; arrows Fig.\u00a04f, h). Collagen fiber density was also increased around CAF-S4 compared to CAF-S1 cells (Fig.\u00a04i), which is consistent with CAF-S4 capacity to exert higher traction forces on their environment, to pull and contract collagen fibers. Overall, these data demonstrate that CAF-S1 are motile, while CAF-S4 are contractile with strong capacity to pull on collagen fibers.CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 promote tumor cell spread by distinct mechanismsCAF-S1 promote proliferation and initiate cancer cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.a Total number of viable BC cells (Dapi\u2212 cells by FACS) in co-culture with CAF-S1 (red) or CAF-S4 (blue) relative to control (\u2212 gray, without CAF) (n\u2009=\u20096 per BC cell type). b Total number of viable BC cells (Resazurin staining) with CAF-S1- or CAF-S4-conditioned medium (CM) relative to control (\u2212, without CM) (n\u2009=\u20099 per BC cell type). c Total number of viable CAF-S1 (red) and CAF-S4 (blue) (Dapi\u2212 cells by FACS) in co-culture with BC cells relative to control (\u2212, without BC cells) (n\u2009\u2265\u20096 per BC cell type). d CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 capacities to attract BC cells (n\u2009\u2265\u20098 per BC cells). e Left, Images of co-staining of Vinculin (red), F-actin (green) and DAPI (blue) in MCF7 (left) or T47D (right) cultured alone, or in presence of CAF-S1 or CAF-S4.

Source data provided in Source Data file, with R scripts used.While CAF function in metastases was investigated in the past, the specific role of CAF subsets on metastatic spread remains unknown. We assessed CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 effects on BC cell properties by using MCF7 and T47D luminal cell lines, as CAF switch between PTs and LNs was prominent in luminal cases. Co-culture of BC cells with CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 increased the number of tumor cells, with a stronger impact of CAF-S1 compared to CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a05a). This effect was also detected with CAF-S1- or CAF-S4-conditioned medium (CM), although at a lower extent (Fig.\u00a05b). CAF subset proliferation increased at long time points of co-culture with cancer cells (Fig.\u00a05c), but not at short term (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04a). Transwell assays showed that BC cell migration was strongly increased toward CAF-S1, but at a much lower extent toward CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a05d). The CAF-S1-pro-migratory effect was independent of its pro-proliferative effect, while the slight impact of CAF-S4 was proliferation-driven (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04b). In agreement with their intrinsic features (Fig.\u00a04), CAF-S4 fibroblasts (easily distinguished from cancer cells by F-actin staining) exhibited more F-actin stress fibers and Vinculin-stained focal adhesions than CAF-S1 (Fig.\u00a05e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c for quantification). Interestingly, in presence of CAF-S1 or CAF-S4, cancer cells were more scattered (Fig.\u00a05e and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04c). Indeed, in presence of CAF-S1, BC cells were less cohesive and more dispersed. With CAF-S4, cancer cells were also less packed but with numerous remaining F-actin interconnections. In agreement with these observations, E-cadherin/CDH1 protein levels decreased at cancer cell membrane in presence of CAF-S1, effect which was also visible but less pronounced with CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a05f and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04d). Thus, these results suggest that CAF-S1\u2013and to a lower extent CAF-S4\u2014promote cancer cell spreading by initiating first steps of EMT.CAF-S4 promote tumor cell invasion in 3D.a Representative 3D views of MDA-MB-231 invasion assessed by inverted Transwell assays, in CAF-free (left), CAF-S1- (middle) or CAF-S4- (right) embedded collagen matrix.

Source data provided in Source Data file, with R scripts used.As CAF-S4 properties were linked to 3D environments, we moved to such systems to analyze their impact on BC cell invasiveness in surrounding matrix. We first used an inverted Transwell assay to test CAF subset-mediated matrix remodeling on BC cell invasion (Fig.\u00a06a\u2013f). In this assay, cancer cells need to cross the membrane to invade the matrix. MCF7 and T47D cells are not invasive enough to obtain quantifiable results, we thus chose to work with MDA-MB-231, a TN invasive cell line. The highest z-distance covered by cancer cells in the matrix was significantly increased in CAF-S1- and even more in CAF-S4-embedded collagen (Fig.\u00a06a, b). If cancer cells browsed in average 72\u2009\u03bcm above the membrane in a CAF-free matrix, they reached 109\u2009\u03bcm in presence of CAF-S1 and 129\u2009\u03bcm with CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a06b). We next looked at the average distribution of cancer cell frequency along z-axis, every 10\u2009\u03bcm from the membrane up to 200\u2009\u03bcm. Major part of cancer cells was below 30\u2009\u03bcm, distance from which a major drop was observed (Fig.\u00a06c). Interestingly, beyond 30\u2009\u03bcm, CAF-S4 significantly increased the proportion of cancer cells compared to control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e, left). Similar results were obtained when increasing the invasion threshold, with an even greater impact of CAF-S4 on tumor cell invasion (Fig.\u00a06d and Supplementary Fig.\u00a04e, right). To go deeper in the characterization of BC cell motility in 3D, we took advantage of the tumor-on-chip system, a microfluidic device where cancer cells and CAF subsets were co-cultured in 3D and followed by time-lapse video microscopy. In this system, we reproduced the intrinsic CAF subset motility, CAF-S1 being more motile than CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a04f). In addition, velocity of GFP-labeled BC cells increased in presence of CAF-S4, and at a lower extent CAF-S1 (Fig.\u00a06e, f). In tumor-on-chip, CAF subset-mediated effect was more important on T47D (Fig.\u00a06f) than MCF7 (Fig.\u00a06e), probably because T47D cells are less motile at basal levels than MCF7 (around 0.1\u2009\u03bcm/min for MCF7 and 0.05\u2009\u03bcm/min for T47D). Taken together, these results show that both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 stimulate BC cell motility, via different effects: CAF-S1 initiate first steps of EMT and secrete factors that attract cancer cells, while CAF-S4 remodel the matrix and promote cancer cell invasion in 3D.CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 induce cancer cell invasion by TGF\u03b2/CXCL12 and NOTCHCAF-S1 and CAF-S4 promote cancer cell invasion by TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and NOTCH.a Up, Representative images of E-cadherin (red), F-actin (green) and DAPI (blue) in BC cells alone (\u2212) or with CAF-S1 transfected with non-targeting (siCTL) or CXCL12-targeting (siCXCL12) siRNA.

Source data provided in Source Data file, with R scripts used.We next sought to define the molecular actors involved in CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pro-invasive effects. As CAF-S1 attract cancer cell at distance and secrete high levels of CXCL12 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05a), we first analyzed the impact of CXCL12 silencing in CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05b) on BC cell proliferation and migration. Interestingly, CAF-S1 silenced for CXCL12 partly lost their ability to initiate EMT in cancer cells, while CXCL12-silencing had no impact in CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a07a). Indeed, BC cells were more clustered and E-cadherin protein levels in tumor cells increased after CXCL12 silencing in CAF-S1 but not in CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a07a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05c). We also observed that CXCL12-silencing in CAF-S1 decreased BC cell chemo-attraction without affecting their proliferation rate (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05d, e). In agreement with these observations, even partial inhibition of CXCR4 in cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05f) affected their scattering and EMT initiation by CAF-S1 (Fig.\u00a07b). This suggests that both CXCL12 secretion by CAF-S1 and CXCR4 expression in cancer cells are involved in CAF-S1-mediated EMT initiation in BC cells. As we observed an upregulation of the TGF\u03b2-signaling pathway in CAF-S1 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05g), we wondered whether this pathway, strong EMT inducer, could also be involved in CAF-S1-mediated EMT initiation. As the expression of TGF\u03b2 receptors (TGFBR1, 2 and 3) was upregulated in CAF-S1 cells compared to CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a05h), we compared the impact of TGFBR inhibitor on CAF-S1- and CAF-S4-induced EMT initiation on cancer cells (Fig.\u00a07c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a05i). TGFBR inhibition affected initiation of EMT in cancer cells in presence of CAF-S1 cells, while it had no impact on cancer cells alone and a weak effect with CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a07c). Taken together, these results show the role of TGF\u03b2 and CXCL12 signaling pathways in CAF-S1-dependent pro-tumorigenic phenotype.Concerning CAF-S4, NOTCH pathway and three out of the four NOTCH receptors (NOTCH 1\u20133) were significantly upregulated in CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06a, b). We observed that DAPT, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor and pan-NOTCH inhibitor, severely reduced CAF-S4 contractile capacity assessed in collagen gel assays, while DAPT had no impact on CAF-S1 fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a07d). Due to this strong effect of NOTCH inhibition on CAF-S4 contractility, we next analyzed in-depth the effect of NOTCH on CAF-S4. We verified that DAPT had no effect on CAF-S4 viability (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06c). As expected, Blebbistatin and Y27632, potent myosin and ROCK inhibitors used as positive controls, also abolished CAF-S4 contraction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06d). Using TFM, we confirmed that DAPT treatment also diminished the Strain Energy Density globally exerted by CAF-S4 cells (Fig.\u00a07e), although it did not significantly affect the magnitude of the stress which averages the local traction forces (Fig. S6e). Moreover, the inverted Transwell invasion assay confirmed the role of NOTCH in CAF-S4-mediated BC cell invasion. Indeed, both the maximal distance reached and the percentage of invading tumor cells were reduced by NOTCH inhibition in CAF-S4-embedded matrix (Fig.\u00a07f, h), while it had no or much lower impact without CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06f, g). Finally, using tumor-on-chip devices, we further showed that, although cancer cell motility was not affected by DAPT treatment in absence of CAF-S4, CAF-S4 were completely unable to induce BC cell invasion in presence of DAPT (Fig.\u00a07i, j). Altogether, these data demonstrate that NOTCH signaling in CAF-S4 is essential to remodel the matrix and promote BC cell invasion in 3D. Finally, by using a cytokine array, we verified that the release of other chemokines and interleukins, such as IL6, IL8, CCL2, CCL5, known to be involved in crosstalk between CAF and cancer cells, was not statistically different between CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 (Supplementary Fig.\u00a06i, j). In conclusion, CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote BC cell migration and EMT initiation in cancer cells in a CXCL12- and TGF\u03b2-dependent manner. In addition, CAF-S4 fibroblasts stimulate cancer cell invasion and motility in 3D by increasing contractility through the NOTCH signaling pathway.CAF-S4-enriched LNs are associated with poor patient survivalCAF subset content in LNs is a prognostic marker.a Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showing patient disease-free survival according to percentage (%) of stroma relative to epithelium in LN sections (n\u2009=\u2009119).

Two myofibroblast subsets (CAF-S1, red and CAF-S4, blue) are highly abundant in invaded LNs and correlated with tumor cell invasion. Middle: While patients with low-CAF content in LNs at diagnosis have less risk to develop late distant metastasis, those presenting high CAF-S1/S-4 quantity are prone to develop distant metastases, in particular in liver if LNs are CAF-S4-enriched. Right: Both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 display pro-invasive properties through distinct mechanisms. CAF-S1 promote cancer cell proliferation, attraction and EMT initiation through CXCL12-CXCR4 and TGF\u03b2 axes. Highly contractile and matrix remodeler CAF-S4 induce cancer cell invasion in 3D via NOTCH signaling pathway. Thus, our work reveals the clinical interest of defining CAF subsets content in LNs at diagnosis.

We analyzed the impact of global stroma content and CAF subset enrichment in LN on disease-free survival, i.e. survival without local, regional or distant relapse (Fig.\u00a08a and Table\u00a01). As CAF-S1 are able to initiate EMT, we quantified the percentage of stromal and epithelial compartments in LNs. High content in stroma in LNs was associated with a shorter disease-free survival, with a similar tendency for overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.06 by Log Rank test and p\u2009=\u20090.07 by Cox regression model) (Fig.\u00a08a, b and Table\u00a01). Using multivariate Cox regression analysis with additive model, we observed that the stromal content was independent of BC subtypes and LN status at diagnosis, two well-established independent prognostic parameters (Table\u00a01). As invaded LNs are mainly composed of CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 (Fig.\u00a02), these results suggested that both CAF subsets, when present in high quantity in invaded LNs at diagnosis, might be deleterious for patient survival. We found that CAF subsets on their own exhibited a faint but significant prognostic value, in particular when patients were stratified according to their stromal content in LNs (Fig.\u00a08c and Supplementary Table\u00a06). Indeed, among patients who displayed high stromal content in LNs at diagnosis, those enriched in CAF-S4 showed the poorest overall survival, while no difference according to CAF subset was observed in the context of low stromal content (Fig.\u00a08c). Of note, the prognostic value of CAF subset content in LNs is interesting\u2013although faint\u2014as it is not observed in PT. Considering that CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 enhance BC cell invasive capacities and that most BC patients decease from metastases, we next looked at distant metastases developed after diagnosis. In line with our results, patients who developed such metastases were mainly patients with CAF-abundant LNs at diagnosis, with a similar repartition in BC subtype (Fig.\u00a08d). The impact on distant metastatic spread was even stronger in CAF-S4- than in CAF-S1-enriched LN patients, effect detected in all BC subtypes (Fig.\u00a08e). Overall, patients who showed LNs with high stromal content and specific enrichment in CAF-S4 were more prone to develop late distant metastases than any other patients, in particular in liver (Fig.\u00a08f, g). Although metastatic sites vary according to BC subtypes with bone as the most common site except in TN BC associated with other niches, such as liver, CAF-S4 impact was not associated to a specific BC subtype. Indeed, among all patients displaying late liver metastasis, only one patient (6%) presented HER2 overexpression at diagnosis. Moreover, CAF-S4-enriched metastatic patients were numerous both within Lum and TN BC subtypes (Fig.\u00a08g). We even detected a higher proportion of patients categorized as CAF-S4-enriched with high stromal content in LNs in the Lum BC subtype compared to TN BC patients (60% Lum versus 33% TN). Thus, patients with high-CAF-S4 content in LNs, who tended to metastasize into liver, were not enriched in TN BC subtype in the cohort analyzed. The impact of CAF subset on metastatic spread was thus not related to a bias linked to BC subtype. On the whole, these data highlight the role of CAF-S1 and particularly CAF-S4 subsets in human BC relapse and metastases (see Model Fig.\u00a08h).DiscussionAlthough the role of CAF in metastatic spread is well established, when analyzed as a global population, we address here the link between CAF subsets and BC cell spread. Axillary metastatic LN exhibit four CAF subsets (CAF-S1 to S4) but are highly enriched in \u03b1SMA+ CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets. The abundance of \u03b1SMA+ CAF at PT has been associated with poor prognosis in BC. In agreement with our findings, a recent study reported that the global stromal content in metastatic LN provides a prognostic stratification of BC patients. We go a step further by differentiating CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 and by showing that the CAF-S1/CAF-S4 status in LNs exhibits a prognostic value, while this is not the case when considering CAF subset enrichment in PT. This underlines the relevance of our study in BC pathology and indicates that assessing the content in CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets in LNs might be helpful for clinical diagnosis.Both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 subsets exhibit pro-invasive properties yet with distinct modes of action. CAF-S1 enhance tumor cell migration and EMT initiation, while CAF-S4 favor cancer cell invasion and motility in 3D. Although the impact of CAF in metastatic spread has been previously demonstrated, we show here the complementary role of two distinct CAF subpopulations in metastases. We identify a crosstalk between CAF-S1 and cancer cells involving both CXCL12 and TGF\u03b2, consistent with data showing that CAFs secrete CXCL12 and promote cancer cell migration. In addition, we highlight the role of TGF\u03b2, a well-known EMT inducer and an important player in fibroblast activation. Both CXCL12 and TGF\u03b2 expression are found in BC metastatic sites, in particular lung and bones, supporting they are particularly relevant in BC. In contrast to CAF-S1, CAF-S4 are highly contractile and exert a pro-invasive effect on cancer cells. Although mechanisms linking CAF contractility to cancer cell invasion have been described, we unveil here the NOTCH pathway as a key player. NOTCH pathway has been studied in cancer with a strong focus on cancer cells. Our data show that NOTCH exerts a key role in CAF-S4 contractility and its pro-invasive action in BC. Thus, we report specific CAF-S1 and CAF-S4-mediated processes and mechanisms that promote metastatic spread in BC.The four CAF subsets we identified in LN mirror CAF subpopulations in PTs. This is consistent with studies showing that LN stroma mimics PT microenvironment. But, our results provide new insights. Indeed, if the four CAF subsets are detected in both PT and LN, their abundance strikingly differs. Compared to PT, LNs are almost exclusively enriched in activated CAF-S1 and CAF-S4. The transcriptomic signatures of CAF subsets from LN validated molecular similarities between CAF-S1 (or CAF-S4) from PT and LN. If few studies addressed CAF transcriptomic profiles in both PTs and LNs from BC patients, a short gene list identified in ref.  allows to discriminate LN from PT bulk samples. Interestingly, most of these genes are highly detected in CAF-S4, consistent with their abundance in metastatic LNs. Although CAF origin remains an open question, CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 transcriptomic profiles generated from PT and LN indicate that subset identity is similar between the two tissues. A recent study identified nine stromal populations by single-cell RNAseq in mouse LN, including the established FRCs, FDC and perivascular cells. Although these cells were identified in non-cancerous mouse lymphoid tissues, CAF-S1 are close to CD34+ stromal cells and CAF-S4 to perivascular cells. Our data on CAF-S4 are consistent with previous studies showing the existence of pericyte-like CAF and their potential pericytes-derived origin. Thus, CAF subsets in invaded LNs could derive from different resident mesenchymal cells. In conclusion, by combining the study of BC patient samples and performing functional assays on human CAF subset cultures, we demonstrate that CAF subsets exhibit distinct functions in metastatic spread. Considering the deleterious effect of metastases on BC patients\u2019 survival, our data might strengthen the interest in assessing CAF subsets content in LN for clinical diagnosis and in using anti-TGF\u03b2 and/or anti-NOTCH therapies in BC.MethodsCohorts of BC patientsThe projects developed here are based on surgical residues, available after histopathological analyses, and not required for diagnosis. There is no interference with clinical practice. Analysis of PT and metastatic LN samples was performed according to the relevant national law on the protection of people taking part in biomedical research. All patients included in our study were informed by their referring oncologist that their biological samples could be used for research purposes and they gave their verbal informed consent. In case of patient refusal, that could be either orally expressed or written, residual tumor samples were not included in our study. Human experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee (CRI) of the Institut Curie Hospital group (approval 12 February 2014) and CNIL (Commission Nationale de l\u2019informatique et des Libert\u00e9s) (No. approval: 1674356 delivered 30 March 2013). HER2-amplified carcinomas have been defined according to ERBB2 immunostaining using ASCO\u2019s guideline. Luminal (Lum) tumors were defined by positive immunostaining for ER (estrogen receptor) and/or PR (progesterone receptor). The cut-off used to define hormone receptor positivity was 10% of stained cells. Ki67 (proliferation) score further distinguishes Lum A from Lum B tumors (below 15%: Lum A, above: Lum B). TN immunophenotype was defined as follows: ER\u2212PR\u2212 ERBB2\u2212 with the expression of at least one of the following markers: KRT5/6+ or EGF-R+.BC PTs and metastatic LNs from prospective cohorts were collected as part of routine standard of care and included in this study after evaluation by a pathologist. CAF subsets were analyzed from fresh PT and LN samples by FACS (16 PTs and 20 LN), RNA sequencing (5 PTs and their corresponding LN), and cultured in vitro (14 PT and 8 LN). Prospective cohorts mainly include Lum subtypes.PT (up to 75) and LN samples (up to 124) from retrospective cohorts of BC patients suffering from invasive BC cancers with at least one metastatic LN at diagnosis, have been collected as part of routine standard of care and analyzed by IHC. Retrospective cohorts include Lum, HER2 and TN subtypes. IHC were performed on residual surgery samples prior to any treatment (i.e. prior to radiation, hormonal or chemo-therapy). Overall survival and disease-free survival have been defined as followed: overall survival is defined as the period of time going from diagnosis to death of the patient; disease-free survival is the period of survival without local, regional or distant relapse, meaning the period of time going from diagnosis to the first event occurring among local, regional or distant relapse.Clinical features of prospective and retrospective cohorts are listed in Tables\u00a0S1 and S2.Flow cytometry on BC PT and LN samplesFresh human BC PT and LN samples were collected directly from the operating room, after surgical specimen\u2019s macroscopic examination and selection of areas of interest by a pathologist. Samples were cut into small pieces (around 1\u2009mm3) and digested in CO2-independent medium (Gibco #18045-054) supplemented with 150\u2009\u03bcg/ml liberase (Roche #05401020001) and DNase I (Roche #11284932001) during 40\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C with shaking (180\u2009rpm). Cells were then filtrated through a 40-\u03bcm cell strainer (Fisher Scientific #223635447) and resuspended in PBS+ solution (PBS, Gibco #14190; EDTA 2\u2009mM, Gibco #15575; Human Serum 1%, BioWest #S4190-100) at a final concentration between 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 and 106 cells in 50\u2009\u03bcl.Cells in suspension were then stained with an antibody mix containing anti-EpCAM\u2212BV605 (1:50; BioLegend, # 324224), anti-CD31-PECy7 (1:100, BioLegend, #303118), anti-CD45\u2212APC-Cy7 (1:20, BD Biosciences, #BD-557833), anti-CD235a-PerCP/Cy5.5 (1:50, Biolegend, #349109), anti-CD29-Alexa Fluor 700 (1:100, BioLegend, #303020), anti-FAP-APC (primary antibody, 1:100, R&D Systems, #MAB3715), anti-PDGFR\u03b2-PE (1:40, BioLegend, #323606) and anti-PDPN-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:50, BioLegend, #337006) for surface staining and anti-SMA-Alexa Fluor 594 (1:25, R&D Systems, #IC1420T-025) for intracellular staining. All antibodies except FAP were purchased already conjugated with fluorescent dyes. Anti-FAP antibody was conjugated with fluorescent dye Zenon APC Mouse IgG1 labeling kit (1:100, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #Z25051). Isotype control antibodies for each CAF marker used were: iso-anti-CD29 (1:100, BioLegend, #400144), iso-anti-FAP (primary antibody, 1:200, R&D Systems, #MAB002), iso-anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (1:20, BioLegend, #400114), iso-anti-PDPN (1:125, BioLegend, #400525) and iso-anti-SMA (1:25, R&D Systems, #IC003T). For intracellular staining, cells were incubated with violet LIVE/DEAD dye (1:1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #L34955) for 20\u2009min at room temperature (RT) in PBS (Gibco, #14190) to exclude dead cells, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Electron Microscopy Sciences, #15710) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After a rapid washing step in PBS\u2009+\u2009solution, cells were incubated for 45\u2009min at RT with the antibody mix in PBS\u2009+\u2009supplemented with 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, #S7900). For surface staining, cell suspensions were stained immediately after dissociation of BC PT and LN samples during 15\u2009min at RT with the antibody mix in PBS+ solution. 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml DAPI (Thermo Fisher scientific, #D1306) was added just before flow cytometry analysis. For primary CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 culture characterization, cells at 80% confluency were collected after trypsin treatment, resuspended in PBS\u2009+\u2009solution at a final concentration of 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells in 50\u2009\u03bcl and intracellularly stained with the above-described protocol.In both conditions (surface and intracellular staining), signals were acquired on the LSRFortessaTM analyzer (BD biosciences) for flow cytometry analysis. At least 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 events were recorded. Compensations were performed using single staining on anti-mouse IgG and negative control beads (BD biosciences, #552843) for each antibody except anti-PDPN, on ArC reactive beads (Molecular probes #A10346) for live/dead staining and on AbC Total Antibody Compensation Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A10513) for anti-PDPN.Data analysis was performed using FlowJo version X 10.0.7r2. Cells were first gated based on forward (FSC-A) and side (SSC-A) scatters (measuring cell size and granularity, respectively) to exclude debris. Dead cells were excluded based on their positive staining for Live/Dead (fixed conditions) or DAPI (surface staining). Single cells were next selected based on SSC-A versus SSC-W parameters. Gating included EPCAM\u2212, CD45\u2212, CD31\u2212, CD235a\u2212 cells, to remove epithelial (EPCAM+), hematopoietic (CD45+), endothelial (CD31+) and red blood cells (CD235a+). Cells from the negative fraction were next examined using the 5 CAF markers FAP, CD29, \u03b1SMA, PDGFR\u03b2 and PDPN.FlowSom algorithm was performed using R packages FlowSOM (1.12.0) and flowCore (1.462), according to the methodology described in ref. . Self-Organizing Map was performed on all EPCAM\u2212, CD45\u2212, CD31\u2212, CD235a\u2212 cells from 16 PTs and from 20 LNs to generate unified trees based on the expression of the five CAF markers. CAF subset populations were manually annotated.IHC analysesBC PT and LN cases were selected by Pathologists (see Supplementary Table\u00a02) and serial sections of paraffin-embedded tissues (PT: Tissue-Micro-Arrays (TMA) using two cores (1\u2009mm diameter, selected as representative from whole-tumor tissue sections by Pathologists) of tumor per case and cut in slices of 3\u2009\u00b5m; LN: whole sections of 3-\u03bcm thickness) were stained on the Lab Vision Autostainer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Dewaxing and antigen retrieval on slides prior to immunohistochemical staining were performed with EnVision FLEX Target Retrieval Solution (high- or low-pH, as required\u2014see below\u2014Dako, #K800421 or #K800521) on the Lab Vision PT Module (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Antigen detection was done using the EnVision FLEX/HRP (Dako, #K8006) for CD29, \u03b1SMA and PDGFR\u03b2 or the streptavidin-peroxidase protocol (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Labs #PK-6101/6102/6104) plus detection with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine for 5\u2009min (DAB, Dako, #K3468) for FSP1, EPCAM (on LN) and FAP. The following antibodies and respective conditions were used: anti-FAP (pH\u2009=\u20096, 1\u2009h at 1:200, Vitatex #MABS1001), anti-CD29 (pH\u2009=\u20096, 1\u2009h at 1:100, Abcam #ab3167), anti-FSP1 (pH\u2009=\u20096, 1\u2009h at 1:250, Abcam #ab27957), anti-\u03b1SMA (pH\u2009=\u20096, 30\u2009min at 1:200, Dako #M0851), anti- PDGFR\u03b2 (pH\u2009=\u20099, 1\u2009h at 1:100, Abcam #ab32570), anti-EPCAM (pH\u2009=\u20096, 1\u2009h at 1:200, Dako #M0804), anti-E-cadherin (pH\u2009=\u20099, 1\u2009h at 1:100, Invitrogen #180223). Counterstaining was performed with Mayer hematoxylin freshly prepared (Dako, #S3309). Tissue sections were then submitted to serial gradients of xylen and mounted with coverslip in an automatic device (Sakura, Tissue-Tek DRS).In each sample, CAF marker staining was evaluated as a histological score (H-score), defined by staining intensity (ranging from 0 to 4) multiplied by the percentage of stained fibroblasts. For LNs, only fibroblasts in metastatic zones\u2014assessed by EPCAM staining\u2014were evaluated. For each PT and LN sample, CAF enrichment was established applying an algorithm developed by the team, which takes as input CAF markers H-scores, as described in refs. . In brief, the thresholds were first defined in a learning dataset on the distribution (1st quartile, median and 3rd quartile) of each marker using FACS data. Thresholds were then transposed to IHC data. For each section, the percentages of stroma and epithelial compartments were evaluated by combining three distinct methods: evaluation on morphological criteria by a referent pathologist; quantification with an automated approach using the QuantCenter image analysis platform (3DHistech) based on morphology assessment and EPCAM staining performed by an independent researcher; EPCAM and E-cadherin staining of epithelial cells. All quantifications gave very consistent results whatever the person (pathologist versus researcher), the method (manually versus automated) or the staining (EPCAM/E-cadherin), thereby arguing that evaluation of stromal and epithelial content was accurate. In each section, percentage of stroma was evaluated as the fibroblastic area multiplied by 100 divided by the total sample area.Design of a decision tree for CAF subset predictionCAF identity was determined by using an algorithm developed by the team (shown in Fig.\u00a02d), which takes as input histological scores of CAF markers. The thresholds were first defined, in a learning dataset, on the distribution (1st quartile, median and 3rd quartile) of each marker using FACS data. Thresholds were then transposed to IHC data.CAF subsets and epithelial cells at cellular level in situ in invaded LNsIHC staining from consecutive sections were scanned on Philips Ultra Fast Scanner; 5\u00d7 images of CAF markers including FAP, CD29, FSP1 and SMA (markers used in the decision tree algorithm, see also Fig.\u00a02d) as well as EPCAM staining from the same areas in representative invaded LNs were further analyzed. Images were aligned using elastic transformation from Fiji software plugin (bUnwarpJ). This plugin uses landmarks manually defined on hematoxylin & eosin staining of the sections to compute the optimal correlation between images and alignment at cellular level. Images were divided into tiles of 225\u2009\u00b5m2 to mimic the approximate size of one fibroblast and each tile was annotated according to the position in the section. Aligned and annotated images of the CAF markers were then submitted to color deconvolution and the intensity of each DAB staining was measured by densitometry analysis using ImageJ software. Each tile was classified into a specific CAF subset using the algorithm developed by the team (see \u2018Design of a decision tree for CAF subset prediction' and Fig.\u00a02d), which takes as input DAB intensities of CAF markers measured within each tile. Epithelial tumor cells were detected based on EPCAM staining to better visualize the stromal compartment and each tile was colored according to the classification into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4, with CAF-S1 red, CAF-S2 orange, CAF-S3 green and CAF-S4 blue.Gene expression profiling by RNAseqCAF-S1, CAF-S4 and EPCAM+ cells (from PTs and LNs of five patients, n\u2009=\u200928 samples in total, see Supplementary Table\u00a01) were sorted after surface staining (see \u2018Flow Cytometry on BC PT and LN samples') on FACSARIA (BD biosciences), directly into RNase-free tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific #AM12450). At least 100 cells were collected per cell population. Total RNA was extracted with Single Cell RNA Purification kit (Norgen Biotek #51800) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA integrity and quality were checked with Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent, #5067-1513) and apparatus. cDNA synthesis and amplification were synthetized using SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Clontech #634892). cDNA quality was checked on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent #5067-4626) and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Life Technologies, #Q32854). cDNA libraries were prepared using Nextera XT preparation kit (Illumina #FC-131-10). Samples were sequenced on HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) rapid run flow cells with an average sequencing depth of 34.5 million paired-end reads. Read length was 100\u2009bp. Reads were mapped on reference human genome (hg19/GRCh37 from UCSC genome release) using Tophat_2.0.6 algorithm with the following parameters: global alignment, no mismatch in seed alignment (of size 22), three mismatches in read length. Quality control was performed using FastQC software and duplicates were removed using Samtools rmdup. Gene expression quantification was performed using HTSeq-count and featureCounts (implemented in Bioconductor R package Rsubread (1.18.0)). Only genes with at least one read in 5% of all samples were kept for further analyses. Normalization was performed with DESeq2 R package (1.8.2) method. Analysis strategy includes unsupervised analyses such as PCAs and HC, as well as paired differential expression analyses (done with DESeq2 bioconductor package). Biological interpretation of the identified genes was done by computational functional analyses on Metascape (http://metascape.org), which is based on several bioinformatics resources (Gene Ontology, KEGG, Reactome). RNAseq data have been deposited on EGA website (EGA number: EGAS00001003238).Cell cultureThe human BC cell lines MCF-7(-GFP), T47D(-GFP) and MDA-MB-231-GFP were propagated in DMEM (GE, #SH30243.01) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biosera, #1003/500), penicillin (100\u2009U/ml) and streptomycin (100\u2009\u03bcg/ml) (Gibco #15140122). Each cell line identity was verified by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) DNA profiling (Promega #B9510).CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 primary cultures were established from PT and LN human samples. All along the duration of the project, we isolated 22 CAF-S1 and 22 CAF-S4 paired primary cell lines (referred to as CAF pairs because isolated from the same patient) using FACS-sorted cells full-filling marker criteria shown in Fig.\u00a01. Among them, 64% were from PTs and 36% from LNs. In agreement with the strong transcriptomic analogy of CAF subsets from PT or LN (shown Fig.\u00a03), we did not observe any difference in functional assays when we performed experiments with CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 isolated either from PT or from LN. Thus, we observed no effect of the site of isolation (PT or LN) on CAF-S1/CAF-S4 properties. Transcriptomic signatures and in vitro properties were thus equivalent whatever the site of CAF initial localization (PT or LN). Although CAF-S1 were quite easily expanded in vitro, CAF-S4 were difficult to maintain. As they exhibit a pericyte-like signature, we adapted the culture conditions to expand and maintain both CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 in similar and comparable conditions. BC samples were processed and sorted after surface staining as described above (see \u2018Flow Cytometry on BC PT and LN samples') by cell sorting and gating strategy using FACS shown in Fig.\u00a01. Purified CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 were then plated in 96-well plates and expanded in a pericyte medium (Sciencell, #1201) in a humidified, 1.5% O2 and 5% CO2 incubator. Doubling time was assessed during this expansion phase for six CAF pairs over five passages. All cultures were systematically validated by qRT-PCR between passages 3 and 6 using genes upregulated in either CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 (including SFRP2, HMCN1, TINAGL1, PDE3A). Other types of validation were done, such as RNAseq on four CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs and FACS analyses (see \u2018Flow Cytometry on BC PT and LN samples') to assess CAF marker protein levels (as shown in Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). For RNAseq experiment, cells at 80% confluency were collected after trypsin treatment, total RNA was extracted (Qiagen #217004) and DNAse-treated (Life technologies #EN0525). mRNAs were retro-transcribed, amplified and cDNA libraries were obtained with TruSeq Stranded mRNA library prep (Illumina #RS-122-2101). Samples were then sequenced and analyzed as PT and LN fresh CAF samples (see \u2018Gene expression profiling by RNAseq'). To validate their identity, PCA and HC were performed using CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 top-500 gene signatures. These signatures were defined as the 500 genes upregulated and the 500 genes downregulated between PT\u2009+\u2009LN CAF-S1 (n\u2009=\u200910) and CAF-S4 (n\u2009=\u200910) fresh paired samples (paired differential analysis by DESeq2). Twenty-two different CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 paired primary cell lines were isolated from BC PTs (n\u2009=\u200914) and LNs (n\u2009=\u20098) (see Supplementary Table\u00a01 for clinical information) were used for functional experiments. All experiments were performed in DMEM with 10% FBS at 1.5% O2 unless otherwise specified. For BC cells and primary CAF cell lines, the absence of mycoplasma contamination has been tested and confirmed.Silencing of CXCL12, CXCR4 and transient transfectionFor the short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiment, CAF-S1, CAF-S4 or breast cancer cells were transfected with 20\u2009nM siRNA. Control was non-targeting siRNA (siCTR, AllStars negative control, #1027281), CXCL12 silencing was performed with a siRNA pool targeting both \u03b1- and \u03b2-CXCL12 isoforms (Dharmacon, #L-007873-00) and CXCR4 silencing was achieved with a pool of four specific siRNA (Dharmacon, #L-005139-00). Transfections were performed with DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon, #T-2001-02) transfection reagent according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.qRT-PCR from CAF subsets and BC cell linesFor gene expression analysis, total RNA isolation was performed using miRNEasy kit (Qiagen, #217004) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop apparatus (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.). For each sample, 1\u2009\u03bcg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using an iScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Bio-Rad #1708840). qRT-PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, #4367659) on a CFX96 or CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with primers at 300\u2009nM final concentration. Primers (forward and reverse) used for quantitative (q)RT\u2013PCR amplification were: CXCL12: 5\u2032\u2013CTACAGATGCCCATGCCGAT\u20133\u2032 5\u2032\u2013CAGCCGGGCTACAATCTGAA\u20133\u2032, CXCR4: 5\u2032\u2013TGGCCTTATCCTGCCTGGTATTGT\u20133\u2032 5\u2032\u2013AGGAGTCGATGCTGATCCCAATGT\u20133\u2032. Silencing validation was performed from at least four independent experiments.Transwell assayTwelve-well cell culture inserts (Corning, 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size, #353182) were used for migration assays, and migration was assessed 24\u2009h after plating.For CAF migration, after 24\u2009h serum deprivation (0.5% FBS), 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in the upper side of the Transwell device in 0.5% FBS medium. Six CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were tested in four independent experiments, in duplicates.For CAF chemo-attraction experiments, 105 CAF (CAF-S1 and CAF-S4) were plated in duplicates in 12-well plates. After CAF attachment (6\u2009h), cells were gently washed with PBS and medium changed to 0.5% FBS. In parallel, MCF7 and T47D that had been serum deprived (0.5% FBS) for 24\u2009h were collected and 105 cells were plated in the upper side of the Transwell device in 0.5% FBS medium, on top of 0.5% FBS medium\u2009\u00b1\u2009CAF. Representative images of Transwell membrane underside shown in Fig.\u00a04 are obtained 24\u2009h after CAF-S1/CAF-S4 seeding in upper part. At least eight independent experiments including at least four different CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were performed with each BC cell line, each condition in duplicates.To assess CXCL12 involvement in CAF-S1 attraction of BC cells, 105 CAF-S1 were plated as described above, after 48\u2009h of transient silencing (see \u2018Silencing of CXCL12, CXCR4 and transient transfection'). BC cell number was increased to 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per insert and plated in triplicates. Three independent experiments including at least two different CAF-S1 cell lines per BC cell type were performed.At the end of the experiment, the remaining cells in the upper side of the Transwell device were gently removed with cotton swabs moistened with PBS. Migrating cells at the bottom side of the Transwell device were fixed and stained with crystal violet for 30\u2009min and then counted in seven different representative fields per insert (X5 objective, Zeiss Axioplan microscope, AxioCamERc 5s, manual counting on Fiji software) and averaged per condition. When we adjusted the migration to proliferation rate, we divided the migration capacity by the fold change in tumor cell proliferation in presence/absence of CM from CAF subsets.Cell exclusion zone assayFor cell exclusion zone assay, Ibidi culture inserts (#80209) were added to 12-well plates (one insert per well) and 104 CAF-S1 or 104 CAF-S4 were plated per chamber of each insert, in duplicates. After cell attachment, inserts were gently removed, delicately washed with PBS and 2\u2009ml of medium was added to each well. Time-lapse videos were then immediately acquired with an inverted motorized Leica video-microscopes, equipped with motorized stage, 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator and CO2 controller (Leica DMi8 with a Retiga R6 camera and illumination by Lumencor SOLA SE 365). The automated imaging system was controlled by the software Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Transmission images were acquired every 15\u2009min until 50\u2009h and one position per insert (hence two per condition) was taken with a 5\u00d7 objective as it encompassed 80% of the cell-free zone. For data analyses, Fiji software was used. In each position, manual tracking of 40 CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 cells per condition positioned on the free edges were tracked over 24\u2009h, taking into consideration the first image of each hour. Velocity (distance of migration divided by the interval time) and direction (absolute value of sin(\u03b1), where \u03b1 is the angle between the velocity and the initial cell-free zone border\u2009\u2013\u2009absolute because cells were taken from both sides of the cell-free zone) were calculated for each successive pair of time points for each cell. Means per cell over the global tracking are shown. Persistence of cell trajectory, defined as the ratio d\u2009/\u2009l where l is the contour length of the total trajectory and d the direct end-to-end distance, was also calculated per cell over the same 24\u2009h. Two different CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were tested in two independent experiments.CAF spheroids and invasion assayFor spheroid invasion assays, CAFs were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml. Atotal of 20 \u03bcl drops were pipetted down on a 10-cm dish lid. Lids were then gently put back on the plates filled with medium to humidify the system. After 4 days, CAF spheroids\u2014formed in the hanging drops\u2014were carefully transferred into 2.5\u2009mg/ml collagen solution drops (Corning, #354249) in the center of 6-well plates. At least six different spheroids per CAF were embedded in collagen and further analyzed. After polymerization, 0.5% FBS medium was added to the wells. Spheroids were imaged 3 days after inclusion on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope with a 4\u00d7 objective equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi1 camera and invasion was assessed with Fiji software as an invasion index defined as the total area covered by CAFs (encompassing single cells escaped from the spheroid and the spheroid) divided by the area of the spheroid core center. Three CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were tested in three independent experiments. For time-lapse imaging, time-lapse videos were immediately acquired after collagen polymerization with an inverted motorized Leica video-microscopes, equipped with motorized stage, 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator and CO2 controller (Leica DMi8 with a Retiga R6 camera and illumination by Lumencor SOLA SE 365). The automated imaging system was controlled by the software Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Transmission images were acquired every 15\u2009min until 42\u2009h with a 5\u00d7 objective to encompass the full spheroid. Videos were mounted with eight frames per second.Collagen contraction assayTo assess force-mediated collagen contraction, 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 CAFs were embedded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of a 2.5-mg/ml collagen solution (Corning, #354249) and seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates. After polymerization, culture medium was added on top of the gels and in the surrounding empty wells to limit evaporation. To assess DAPT (Sigma, #D5942), BLEBBISTATIN (Sigma, #B0560) and Y27632 (STEMCELL Technologies, #72302) impact on CAF contractility, 10 \u03bcM of each drug was added to the medium, DMSO as control. Gel contraction was assessed 4 days after plating: plates were scanned (EPSON Perfection V700 Photo scanner) and quantification was performed on Fiji software. Percentage of contraction was calculated using the formula:. Six CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were tested in four independent experiments. For DAPT experiments, three independent experiments were performed, including four different CAF-S4 cell lines.Traction force microscopyFor TFM experiments, 2.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 CAFs were seeded on collagen pre-coated 25\u2009kPa hydrogels containing fluorescent beads (Matrigen, #ST-0.2YG-SW6G-COL-25 EA). These commercial hydrogels contain fluorescent beads of 0.2\u2009\u00b5m diameter at a density of 0.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009beads/\u00b5m2. Three CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were tested. Cells were plated at low density (~25 cells/mm2) to ensure that traction forces were measured on single cells. When DAPT (Sigma, #D5942) treatment was evaluated, 10\u2009\u03bcM was added to the medium, DMSO as control. Gels (transmission and GFP channels) were imaged on an inverted Leica video-microscope (Leica DMi8 with a Retiga R6 camera and illumination by Lumencor SOLA SE 365) 24\u2009h post-plating with 20\u00d7 objective, the large size of CAF cells with elongated protrusions precluding the use of higher magnification. Images of the relaxed gels were acquired after removing the cells with trypsin. Beads images (with and without the cells) were first aligned using the ImageJ plugin \u201cAlign slices in stack\u201d.Bead displacements (with respect to the resting state after trypsination) were measured and converted to cell traction stresses using the open source Fourier transform traction cytometry Fiji plugins (available at https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/tfm or org.insb.bib.cnrs.fr/10.1016/bs.mcb.2014.10.008)Images were processed with ImageJ software. Further analyses were performed with Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). To quantify cell contractility, we measured the strain energy (SE) which is the total energy transferred from the cell to the elastic substrate, the strain energy density which is the energy per unit area (SE divided by the cell area) and the mean traction stress amplitude which corresponds to the average stress per cell. where  is the traction stress field and  is the displacement field.Collagen evaluation by second harmonic generationCAFs were seeded in home-made holes in 30\u2009mm2 tissue culture plates as described in ref. : three holes of 3\u20134\u2009mm diameter were drilled in a plate and widened around the edges using a scalpel. The bottom of the dish was covered with epoxy (Loctite), and 20\u2009\u00d7\u200920\u2009mm square coverslips were glued to the dish overnight at RT. The day before the experiment, dishes were silanized with 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich) and extensively washed with water treated for 30\u2009min with 0.5% glutaraldehyde followed by a final wash, to avoid collagen detachment from the plastic holes caused by CAF contractility. A total of 3000 CAF\u20142 CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were tested\u2014were embedded in 15\u2009\u03bcl of a 2.5-mg/ml collagen solution (Corning, #354249) and seeded in duplicates in the afore-mentioned holes. After polymerization, medium was added to the plates. Cells were left 3 days in this system, then fixed for 30\u2009min in 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30\u2009min and F-actin was stained using phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #R415, 1:200 O/N in PBS at 4\u2009\u00b0C). Images (of at least 10 cells per CAF over two wells) were acquired with an inverted AOBS two-photon laser-scanning confocal microscope (SP8; Leica) coupled with a femtosecond laser (Chameleon Vision II; Coherent Inc.) using a 25\u00d7/1.0 NA water immersion objective. The microscope was equipped with three nondescanned HyD detectors: NDD1 (500\u2013550\u2009nm), NDD2 (\u2265590\u2009nm) and NDD3 (405\u2009nm). Fluorescence channel was recorded using the excitation wavelength 561\u2009nm. Collagen was visualized by second harmonic generation (SHG) using the excitation wavelength 910\u2009nm. 3D stacks were acquired at a step size of 1\u2009\u00b5m intervals to encompass one whole cell. Images were further analyzed with Fiji software. All collagen images were processed in the same way: light was adjusted (min\u2009=\u20090 and max\u2009=\u200950), thresholded (min\u2009=\u20090, max\u2009=\u200930), converted to mask, smoothed, despeckled and collagen area was measured on all slices of each 3D-stack. Collagen density around each cell was then computed as , where \u0394z is the step between two slices in the stack, n the number of slices in the stack, Vstack the volume of the stack and surf.collslice(s) the area covered by collagen in the slice i of the stack (Fiji output).Proliferation assaysCAF doubling time was assessed over five passages for six pairs or CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 primary cell lines, CAFs being sub cultured when reaching 90% confluency in the plate (see \u2018Cell culture').For co-culture proliferation assay, 105 CAF (-S1 or -S4) and/or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF7 cells (1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 CAF (-S1 or -S4) and/or 7.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 T47D cells) were plated in duplicates in 6-well plates. After cell attachment, cells were washed in PBS and 0.5% medium was added; 24\u2009h or 72\u2009h later, cells were collected (cells in supernatant as well), washed with PBS+ and stained for 15\u2009min at RT with anti-EpCAM-BV605 (BioLegend, #324224) and anti-FAP-APC (primary antibody, R&D Systems, #MAB3715 conjugated with fluorescent dye Zenon APC Mouse IgG1 labeling kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, #Z25051) to distinguish CAFs from BC cells. After a last washing step, all samples were resuspended in 50\u2009\u03bcl of PBS+ containing 2.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml DAPI (Thermo Fisher scientific, #D1306) and 1:100 carboxylated beads (Polyscience, #18133). Total samples were acquired on the LSRFortessaTM analyzer (BD biosciences) and precision beads were used to normalize viable BC cell (DAPI\u2212 EPCAM+ FAP\u2212) and CAF (DAPI\u2212 EPCAM\u2212 FAP+) counts. At least six independent experiments including at least three different CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs were performed per BC cell line.For BC cell viability assessment with CAF CM (three CAF pairs for each three independent experiments and four different CAF-S1 in two independent experiments for CXCL12 silencing), as well as CAF viability assessment with DAPT, BLEBBISTATIN (Sigma, #B0560) or Y27632 (STEMCELL Technologies, #72302) treatment (three independent experiments with two different CAF-S4 each time), we used resazurin assay. Briefly, 104 BC cells were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plates. To evaluate CM-CAF effect, once BC cells attached, cells were gently washed with PBS and 100\u2009\u03bcl of CAF-CM were added to each well. Cell viability was assayed 24\u2009h later. To obtain CM-CAF, 105 CAF were plated in 12-well plates in duplicates (24\u2009h post siRNA transfection for CXCL12 silencing). After attachment, cells were gently washed with PBS and 1\u2009ml of 0.5% FBS medium was added per well. After 24\u2009h, supernatants were collected, duplicates were mixed, centrifugated and immediately used for experiments. For CAF viability assessment, 7\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 CAFs were seeded in triplicates in 96-well plate wells with the different drugs at 10\u2009\u03bcM in the medium (DMSO was used as control). Cell viability was assessed after 24\u2009h, 72\u2009h and 7 days. To do so, 25\u2009\u03bcl of resazurin reagent (0.05\u2009mg/ml, Sigma #R7017) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h and read in a Multi Detection plate reader (Fluostar, BMG Labtech).ImmunofluorescenceFor immunofluorescence experiments, 200,000 BC cells\u2009\u00b1\u2009200,000 CAF (24\u2009h post-silencing when CXCL12 and CXCR4 roles in EMT-triggering was assessed) were seeded on coverslips placed in 6-well plate wells. When TGF\u03b2-R involvement was assessed in EMT-triggering, the TGF\u03b2-RI/II inhibitor LY2109761 (Selleckchem, #S2704) was added at 5\u2009\u03bcM in the medium (DMSO was used as control). Forty-eight hours later, cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 15\u2009min, permeabilized with 0.1% SDS in PBS for 10\u2009min, blocked in PBS-Tween 0.1% with 5% BSA (Euromedex, #04-100-812-C) for 30\u2009min and incubated with antibodies diluted in PBS-Tween 0.1% with 5% BSA overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Antibodies were anti-Vinculin (1:1000, Sigma, #V9131) or E-cadherin (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, #3195). Cells were then incubated with Cy3-anti-mouse secondary (1:500, JacksonImmunoResearch, #715-165-150) or Cy3-anti-rabbit secondary (1:500, JacksonImmunoResearch, #711-165-152) in parallel with Alexa Fluor TM 488 phalloidin (1:200, Invitrogen, #A12379) for 30\u2009min at RT in PBS-Tween 0.1% with 5% BSA. After several washing steps, coverslips were mounted on slides with a drop of Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector, #H-1200). Slides were then examined using an upright Epifluorescence Microscope with Apotome (Zeiss) with a 40\u00d7 oil-immersion objective and images (at least five positions per condition) were acquired with identical exposure times and settings using a digital camera (Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2). At least two independent experiments were performed for each setting and each BC cell line (one CAF pair for CAF-S1 versus CAF-S4 impact in two independent experiments; three CAF-S1 in three independent experiments for CXCL12 involvement; two CAF-S1 in two independent experiments for CXCR4 involvement; at least three CAF-S1 in at least three independent experiments for TGF\u03b2-R involvement).Tumor cell density, E-cadherin in BC cells, F-actin and Vinculin in CAFFor tumor cell density and assessment of staining in CAF subsets, quantifications were performed in two steps on FiJi software. (1) Masks were manually drawn on each merged image to either keep tumor cell zones of CAF zones according to the analyses. Masks were then applied to the corresponding single channel (Dapi, E-cadherin, F-actin or Vinculin depending on the analyses) images. (2) For BC cell density, evaluation of cell number was automatically performed by applying a threshold filter (0, 20) on Dapi channel (raw images opened and auto-scaled with Bio-formats plug-in, saved in jpeg format) followed by a mask conversion, segmentation and then particles were analyzed (size 2000\u201325,000; circularity\u2009>\u20090.2). Cell number was then divided by the tumor zone area. For F-actin or Vinculin signal extraction in CAF, corresponding images were thresholded (a single threshold was set up per experiment on raw images opened and auto-scaled with Bio-formats plug-in, saved in jpeg format: 125 for F-actin, 150\u2013175 for Vinculin), converted to masks, integrated density was retrieved and then divided by CAF zone area. For E-cadherin signal extraction, as CAFs were negative for E-cadherin, step (1) was skipped and step (2) was directly performed. E-cadherin signal area shown in Figs.\u00a05, 7 was defined on ImageJ, and next divided by tumor cell surface. Images were thresholded (single threshold per experiment ranging from 50 to 225 applied on raw images opened and auto-scaled with Bio-formats plug-in, saved in jpeg format), converted to masks, integrated density was retrieved and then divided by tumor zone area.Inverted Transwell assayFor inverted Transwell assays, CAF were first labeled with fluorescent dyes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, for CAF-S1: CellTrace Yellow #C34573, for CAF-S4: CellTrace Violet, #C34571) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol; 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were then embedded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of a 2.5-mg/ml collagen solution (Corning, #354249) and seeded inside 24-well cell culture inserts (Corning, 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size, #3422). CAF-free collagen was used as control. After polymerization, inserts were put upside-down on plate lids and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MD-231-GFP were seeded on the bottom part of the inserts and left to adhere for 2\u2009h. Inserts were then placed in 24-well plates containing 0.5% FBS and complete medium was added inside the insert plates. After 24\u2009h, inserts were gently transferred into new 24-well plates containing 0.5% FBS and further incubated for 6 days. All conditions were done in duplicates. After 7 days of invasion, inserts were gently washed in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 15\u2009min, washed again and mounted with Mounting medium (Aqua-Poly/Mount #18606) on glass-bottom dishes (FisherScientific #15159112). Images were then acquired on an inverted Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope with Spectral Detection and Multi-photon Laser (LSM880NLO/Mai Tai Laser\u2014Zeiss/Spectra Physics) using a 25\u00d7/0.8 NA oil immersion objective. 3D stacks were acquired at a step size of 10\u2009\u00b5m intervals to encompass all invading cells (initial Z set up so that membrane pores were in focus and highest Z where no MDA-MB-231-GFP cells could be detected anymore). Fluorescence channels were recorded using the excitation wavelengths 405\u2009nm (for CAF-S4), 488\u2009nm (for BC cells) and 561\u2009nm (for CAF-S1). At least four stacks were acquired per insert, x and y\u2009=\u2009566.8\u2009\u03bcm; z\u2009=\u2009200\u2009\u03bcm. Images were further analyzed with IMARIS software to retrieve the distance of invasion of all BC cells in each stack, after modeling cells on GFP signals done with the same parameters across stacks (surface detail 2\u2009\u03bcm; threshold absolute intensity 3.00; option \u201cenable splitting of touching objects\u201d was selected; seed points diameter 15\u2009\u03bcm; filtered on voxels above 350). Each stack was normalized to the number of detected cells in the stack to express frequencies of cells. Maximal distance of invasion was defined as the value of Z above which 1% of cells in stack was found. Data were then averaged per condition per experiment. Three independent experiments with two different CAF-S4 cell lines were performed.For DAPT (Sigma, #D5942) treatment, when CAF-S4 were used, they were labeled and included in collagen as described above. MDA-MB-231-GFP cells were seeded as described above (below CAF-S4-free collagen for control experiments or CAF-S4-embedded collagen). 10\u2009\u03bcM DAPT or DMSO was added on both sides of the inserts and media were changed at day 3. All conditions were done in duplicates. Inserts were fixed, acquisition and analysis were performed as described above with the following Imaris parameters: surface detail 2\u2009\u03bcm; Threshold absolute intensity 2.00; option \u201cenable splitting of touching objects\u201d was selected; seed points diameter 15\u2009\u03bcm; filtered on voxels above 300. 5 independent control experiments were performed and 6 independent experiments including 5 different CAF-S4 cell lines were performed to assess DAPT effect on CAF-S4-induced invasion of BC cells.Tumor-on-chip assayThe devices were made of PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane), a biocompatible, gas-permeable and transparent silicone rubber. The devices were micro-fabricated at the Institut Pierre-Gilles de Gennes pour la Microfluidique (IPGG, Paris) using standard soft-lithography or advanced micro-milling for the mold fabrication and soft-lithography methods to prepare the chips. The microfluidic device were sterilized in UV-oven (365\u2009nm wavelength) for 30\u2009min, coated with 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml human fibronectin (Sigma, #F0895) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2, rinsed with PBS and then dried for at least 5\u2009h in a sterile room. Cells were embedded in 2.3\u2009mg/ml collagen hydrogels (PureCol, Advanced Matrix, # 5005 diluted in MEM medium (Sigma Aldrich, # M0275) containing 0.28% NaHCO3 (pH\u2009=\u20098) to adjust the final pH to 7). MCF7-GFP or T47D-GFP targeted density was 1.2\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells/ml, CAF density was 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml. When DAPT (Sigma, #D5942) was used, CAF-S4 were pre-treated overnight before inclusion in collagen and a final concentration of 10\u2009\u03bcM was added to the medium. We verified that DMSO did not interfere with BC cell velocity in the system. Time-lapse videos were then acquired with an inverted motorized Leica video-microscopes, equipped with motorized stage, 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator and CO2 controller (Leica DMi8 with a Retiga R6 camera and illumination by Lumencor SOLA SE 365) in a 20% O2 environment. The automated imaging system was controlled by the software Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Transmission and fluorescent (GFP) images were acquired every 2\u2009h over 30\u2009h and at least four positions per condition were recorded with a 10\u00d7 objective. For data analyses, Fiji software was used. In each position, cells were manually tracked over all frames (\u2018Manual tracking\u2019 plugin, at least 65 cells per condition). Cell velocity (distance of migration divided by the interval time) was calculated for each successive pair of time points. Means per cell over the global tracking are shown. For CAF-S1 versus CAF-S4 experiments, for each BC cell line: three independent experiments were performed, with three different CAF-S1 and CAF-S4 pairs. For DAPT experiments, for each BC cell lines: three independent experiments were performed, including two different CAF-S4 cell lines.Cytokine antibody-pair-based assayCytokine antibody-pair-based assays were performed using human cytokine array kit (R&D Systems, #ARY005B) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. In brief, 80,000 CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 fibroblasts were cultured alone or in presence of 80,000 BC cells (MCF7 or T47D) in 1\u2009ml of DMEM medium in 12-well plates at 1.5% O2 during 48\u2009h. Culture supernatants were next collected (CM) and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm during 10\u2009min for eliminating debris. Array membranes, previously spotted with capture antibodies by the manufacturer, were incubated with 0.5\u2009ml of CM overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Membranes were then washed three times with 50\u2009ml of washing buffer at RT, and incubated with a streptavidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody (1:2000) for 30\u2009min at RT and revealed using Chemi-Reagent Mix. The immunoblot images were captured and visualized using the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and intensity of each spot in the captured images was measured using ImageJ software. Two spots per membrane were used to measure the levels of each cytokine. Intensity mean of the two spots\u2014revealing each cytokine level per experiment\u2014was reported to the intensity mean of three internal controls spotted on the membrane and assessed by the following ratio: specific intensity mean\u2009/\u2009control intensity mean, to take into consideration variation in hybridization efficiency in the different experiments.SoftwareSoftware used for the above analyses are: R (https://cran.r-project.org, R versions 3.3.1, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0), Fiji (ImageJ v2.0.0-rc-19/1.49m, v2.0.0-rc-65/1.52b), IMARIS (v8.4.1), Matlab.Statistical analysesData graphical representation and statistical analyses were done using R or GraphPad Prism environment. Barplots represent means\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard errors of the mean (SEM). Boxplots: box limits indicate the inter-quartile range (IQR) (25th to 75th percentiles), with a center line indicating the median. Whiskers show value ranges up to 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009IQR above the 75th or below the 25th percentiles, with outliers beyond those ranges shown as individual points. The number of independent experiments is specified in each figure legend, with at least three independent experiments, unless otherwise specified. The statistical tests used are in agreement with the data distribution: normality was first checked using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and parametric or non-parametric two-tailed tests were applied according to normality. Statistical test types are indicated in figure legends. Survival analyses were carried out with survival R package by Kaplan\u2013Meier curves (p-values from Log-rank test) and by univariate and multivariate Cox regressions using additive hazards regression models. Stratification of patients for Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses were performed using median value of the stromal content distribution and CAF-S1 or CAF-S4 enrichments (defined by our algorithm, see \u2018IHC analyses'). Differences were considered statistically significant when p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary informationPeer review information Nature Communications thanks Armando del R\u00edo Hern\u00e1ndez and the other anonymous reviewer(s) for their contribution to the peer review of this work.

        "title": "Reduced RhoA expression enhances breast cancer metastasis with a concomitant increase in CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokines signaling.",
        "content": "The role of RhoA GTPases in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis is unclear. Early studies within which mutations in RhoA were designed based on cancer-associated mutations in Ras supported an oncogene role for RhoA. However, recent whole-genome sequencing studies of cancers raised the possibility that RhoA may have a tumor suppression function. Here, using a syngeneic triple negative breast cancer murine model we investigated the physiological effects of reduced RhoA expression on breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis. RhoA knockdown had no effect on primary tumor formation and tumor proliferation, concurring with our in vitro findings where reduced RhoA had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation and clonogenic growth. In contrast, primary tumors with RhoA knockdown efficiently invaded sentinel lymph nodes and significantly metastasized to lungs compared to control tumors. Mechanistically, the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes in the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer showing the ability of RhoA to suppress chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells. Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer.",

RhoA knockdown had no effect on primary tumor formation and tumor proliferation, concurring with our in vitro findings where reduced RhoA had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation and clonogenic growth. In contrast, primary tumors with RhoA knockdown efficiently invaded sentinel lymph nodes and significantly metastasized to lungs compared to control tumors. Mechanistically, the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased cancer-associated fibroblasts and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes in the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer showing the ability of RhoA to suppress chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells. Our work suggests a physiological lung and lymph node metastasis suppressor role for RhoA GTPase in breast cancer.IntroductionRho GTPases belong to the Ras GTPase superfamily and in humans consists of about 20 members. Among them, RhoA, Rac1 and CDC42 are the most studied Rho GTPases. These GTPases act as intermediate signal transducers for a diverse array of cell surface receptors such as cytokine receptors, cadherins, integrins, GPCR, and tyrosine kinases, and therefore regulate major cellular events such as cell polarity, cell migration, cell cycle progression, cytoskeleton rearrangements, vesicular trafficking, and gene expression. Aberrant Rho GTPase signaling results in neurological and immunological abnormalities, and malignant cell transformation.Like most other GTPases, RhoA and their activating proteins, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), are commonly believed to be pro-proliferative and act as cancer oncogenes. The evidence for the oncogenic activity of RhoA was first reported using dominant negative and constitutively active RhoA mutants in fibroblasts. While activating RhoA mutants enhanced the transformation activity of a weakly oncogenic RAS mutant, a dominant negative RhoA mutant abrogated the oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation. Later, RhoA was reported to be overexpressed in several epithelial human cancer tissue samples including, breast, testicular, liver, colorectal, ovarian and gastric carcinoma.Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have identified hitherto undiscovered mutations in cancers and identified recurrent loss-of-function and gain-of-dominant-negative function mutations in RhoA in lymphoma, leukemia and several solid tumors. These latest discoveries, therefore, suggested a possible tumor suppressor function for RhoA in cancers. Indeed, studies with mouse models have demonstrated the tumorigenic and metastatic functions of the identified RhoA dominant-negative alleles in colorectal cancer.In addition, analysis of the RNA-seq data generated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project revealed high expression of several RhoGAP genes, which are the upstream negative regulators of RhoA, in basal-like breast cancer tumors raising the possibility that RhoGAPs are oncogenic. The oncogenic role of a RhoGAP named ARHGAP18 in breast cancer was subsequently proven with mouse transplantation model. Importantly, ARHGAP18 was shown to enhance metastasis partly by inactivating RhoA.Although these recent advances in the field support a tumor suppressive role for RhoA, a comprehensive mechanistic analysis on altered RhoA expression in primary tumors and its subsequent effects on tumor microenvironment and metastasis is lacking. In this study, using the highly metastatic 4T1 orthotopic mouse model, which closely resembles the human triple negative breast cancer, we show that downregulation of RhoA expression increases breast cancer lung metastasis. Mechanistically our study suggests that by increasing the expression of chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, decreased RhoA expression increases the proclivity of cancer cells for the sentinel lymph node and enables the cancer cells to have access to the circulation and metastasize.ResultsRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitroRhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion in vitro.

Although early work suggested a potential oncogenic role for RhoA, numerous recent studies start to challenge this notion. To further investigate the role of RhoA in breast cancer, we stably down-regulated RhoA expression by lentiviral transduction of specific shRNAs (Fig.\u00a01a) and measured the effects of the RhoA knockdown on cancer cells proliferation and invasion. Two different triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (TNBC) were used to ensure the observed effects were not cell type specific. While reduced RhoA expression significantly increased breast cancer cells invasion through Matrigel (Fig.\u00a01b), it did not have a noticeable effect on cell proliferation as measured by two different assays (Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). As a positive control for our proliferation assay, we treated breast cancer cells with a selective MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, and observed an expected near-complete suppression on colony formation in clonogenic growth assay (Fig.\u00a01c).We reasoned that if the effect of RhoA knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion is RhoA specific and physiologically relevant, we would expect to observe the opposite effect when RhoA expression or activity is increased. Indeed, stable expression of a constitutively active RhoA variant, RhoAQ63L, in both BT20 and MDA-MB231 considerably decreased their proclivity to invade (Fig.\u00a01d). Together, these results suggested that in breast cancer cells, RhoA suppresses cell invasiveness.RhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in miceRhoA suppresses breast cancer lung metastasis burden in mice.

Metastasis is a complex multimodal activity that involves both host and tumor cells and can only be adequately addressed with an animal model. To investigate the possible role of RhoA in breast cancer metastasis, we exploited the well-established 4T1 syngeneic murine breast cancer model. The 4T1 TNBC cell line was originally derived from a spontaneous mammary tumor in a Balb/c mouse. Hence, it is widely utilized for syngeneic orthotopic mammary tumor allograft experiments. We generated a panel of lentiviral-mediated stable RhoA knockdowns in 4T1 cells with different levels of knockdowns, and used two of them, with a 30% (shRhoA 34) and a 50% (shRhoA 32) knockdown, for subsequent experiments (Fig.\u00a02a). Concurring with human breast cancer cells results, reduced RhoA expression significantly increased 4T1 cells invasion through Matrigel in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a02b). Significantly, similar effects were observed with stable expression of a dominant negative RhoAT19N, but the opposite effect was observed when the constitutively active RhoAQ63L was expressed in 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Collectively, these findings strongly suggested that the mouse 4T1 breast cancer cells could be used to investigate the role of RhoA in metastasis.To address this question, we first engineered 4T1 cells to express a GFP-LUC hybrid protein to allow the growth and metastasis of the tumor to be monitored by luciferase bioluminescent imaging (BLI). Upon orthotopic implantation of 4T1 cells, all mice in RhoA knockdown and control groups developed primary tumors. In accord with our in vitro findings where RhoA knockdown did not influence breast cancer cell proliferation, at 30 days post-implantation we did not observe any statistically significant changes in weights or expression levels of proliferation antigen ki67 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors when compared with knockdown control (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). We did not observe any statistically significant changes in expression levels of cleaved caspase-3 in RhoA knockdown primary tumors as well (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). On the contrary, bioluminescent imaging of mice at 29 days post-implantation revealed possible distant metastases in mice implanted with the highest RhoA knockdown (shRhoA 32) 4T1 cells (Fig.\u00a02d) showing a dose-dependent effect of RhoA knockdown on cancer metastasis. Indeed, mice implanted with shRhoA 32 knockdown 4T1 cells exhibited a significantly higher lung metastasis burden compared to other groups during histology analysis (Fig.\u00a02e,f). In a complementary approach, we also down regulated the activity of RhoA in 4T1 cells by stably expressing the dominant negative RhoAT19N allele. Significantly, expression of RhoAT19N had the same effect on lung metastasis as the knockdown of RhoA expression in 4T1 cells and with a minimal effect on tumor weights (Supplementary Fig.\u00a02). Collectively, these findings suggested that RhoA could act as a physiological suppressor of breast cancer lung metastasis in mice.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in miceIt has been thought that invasive breast cancer cells from the primary tumor gain access to the systemic circulation through intra-tumoral and peripheral blood vasculature. However, with novel and more sensitive research technologies, scientists have identified that for breast cancer, the major systemic metastasis route is through the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Once tumor cells reach the SLN, they can access the systemic circulation directly without first passing down to the next lymph node.RhoA suppresses breast cancer sentinel lymph node metastasis in mice.

N\u2009=\u20093, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).It is possible that RhoA suppresses the lung metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells by interfering with the access of the cancer cells to the SLN. To examine this possibility, four weeks after implantation, we harvested the draining/sentinel lymph nodes (right axillary LN) from the cancer cells injected sites and processed them for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. As a control, we also harvested lymph nodes (left inguinal LN) on the contralateral side of the primary tumor. IHC analysis of the SLNs with an epithelial cell specific CK8 antibody revealed that the shRhoA 32 knockdown group mice have higher CK8 staining compared to the control mice, while no statistical significance in CK8 staining in the inguinal lymph nodes was observed between RhoA knockdown and control knockdown mice (Fig.\u00a03a). Similar results were observed with a GFP antibody, which specifically stained the 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a03b). Collectively, these observations suggested that when the RhoA expression is reduced, invasive 4T1 cells reached the axillary sentinel lymph node more efficiently than the control cells and readily gain access to the systemic circulation for spreading into other organs including the lungs.Metastasis is a complex multiple-step process. In addition to invading the draining lymph node and entering the circulation, the circulating cancer cells must survive the hostile environmental conditions inside the blood vessels until extravasating into a distant tissue for metastatic colonization. To investigate whether RhoA also suppresses the later steps of the metastasis cascade, we tail-vein injected RhoA knockdown or control knockdown 4T1 GFP-LUC cells in Balb/c mice to bypass the early stages of metastasis. Mice were monitored at days 1, 7 and 14 post-injection for lung tumor burden by bioluminescent imaging. As shown in Fig.\u00a03c,d, both the kinetics of lung tumor formation and extent of the tumor burden showed no significant difference between RhoA knockdown and control group mice suggesting that RhoA may not have a role in cancer cell extravasation and colonization.RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell invasion by modulating the tumor microenvironmentRhoA modulates the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis in breast tumors.

It is possible that reduced RhoA expression promotes cancer cell dissemination into sentinel lymph nodes by modulating this dynamic interplay. To investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the major TME components in the control and RhoA knockdown primary tumors harvested from the Balb/c mice 30 days after the orthotopic implantation. TME is mainly composed of activated fibroblasts called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), adaptive and innate immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells. We examined the presence of vascular endothelial cells, CAFs, B-lymphocytes and macrophages in these primary tumors by IHC staining with CD31, \u03b1-SMA, CD19, and F4/80 specific antibodies, respectively. Though no differences were detected in CD31 and CD19 expression between the two groups, a significant elevation was detected in \u03b1-SMA and F4/80 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors compared to control tumors, suggesting an increased infiltration of CAFs and macrophages in RhoA knockdown tumors, respectively (Fig.\u00a04a and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03).CAFs are known to drive the tumorigenesis and metastasis phenotype by secreting pro-tumorigenic chemokines, and by enhancing tumor stiffness. While we did not detect any significant differences in collagen content/fibrosis between control and RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, IHC staining with pro-tumorigenic chemokine CXCL12 specific antibody revealed that RhoA knockdown tumors are significantly enriched in CXCL12 expression (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplementary Fig.\u00a03). To identify the source of CXCL12 in the TME, we double-stained the RhoA knockdown tumors with \u03b1-SMA and CXCL12 antibodies. We observed that the CXCL12 staining was predominantly co-localized with the staining of \u03b1-SMA suggesting that CXCL12 detected in the TME was mainly secreted by the infiltrated CAFs (Fig.\u00a04c). In agreement with this line of thinking, we failed to detect the expression of CXCL12 in 4T1 cells by qRT-PCR (data not shown). The predominant receptor for CXCL12 is CXCR4. As expected, the expression levels of CXCR4 were also enhanced in RhoA knockdown tumors as measured by IHC staining and qRT-PCR RNA analysis (Fig.\u00a04d,e). Apparently, the enhanced CXCR4 expression is an autonomous effect of the downregulation of RhoA expression in 4T1 cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04e).RhoA modulates the CCR5-CCL5 axis in breast tumors.

N\u2009=\u20094, ns- not significant *P\u2009<\u2009 0.05, unpaired Student\u2019s t-test (two-tailed).Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were shown to promote tumor progression, angiogenesis and lung metastasis in several breast cancer in vivo studies, and associated with poor patient survival. During tumor progression, secretion of tumor-derived chemoattractant chemokines leads to the recruitment of circulating monocytes into breast tumors. The infiltrated monocytes will subsequently differentiate into tumor associated-macrophages. It is possible that the increased number of TAMs is a consequence of increased expression of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors. Truly, RhoA knockdown tumors were significantly enriched in CCL5 expression (Fig.\u00a05a). In addition to secreting CXCL12, CAFs have also been shown to be a key source of CCL5 in tumors. Indeed, CAFs but not the cancer cells, are the major contributors of CCL5 in RhoA knockdown tumors as assessed by immunofluorescent staining and qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a05b,c).Paracrine activities of intra-tumoral CCL5 through its cognate receptor CCR5 are reported to promote breast tumor progression, and LN and thoracic metastasis. It is possible that the observed increase in LN and lung metastases in RhoA knockdown mice is caused by activated CCL5-CCR5 signaling in primary tumors. In agreement with this line of reasoning, we observed the expression levels of CCR5 were increased in RhoA knockdown tumors and the increased CCR5 expression levels are partly due to an increase in CCR5 transcripts in cancer cells (Fig.\u00a05d,e).DiscussionIn this study, we investigated the role of RhoA in breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Stable knockdown of RhoA expression had no effect on breast cancer cell proliferation but increased in vitro cell invasion and metastasis. The reported effects of RhoA shRNA-mediated knockdown on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro are mixed. While we and others observed that RhoA has an anti-invasive role, published reports indicating that RhoA has a pro-invasive role in breast cancer exist. At present, the mechanism of how RhoA can have opposite effects on breast cancer cell invasion in vitro is not known. RhoA GTPase has several downstream effectors and some of them reported to have opposing effects on cancer cells invasion. Therefore, it is plausible that, depending on the experimental conditions, knocking down the expression of RhoA can have preferred effects on certain downstream RhoA effectors. However, despite the described opposite effects of RhoA on in vitro breast cancer cells invasion, the effects of specific RhoA shRNA knockdown on breast cancer metastasis has never been formally addressed with an orthotopic transplantation immune-competent mouse model until now. The results of our in vitro invasion assays align rightly with the in vivo mouse experiments strongly suggesting the causal role of RhoA as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor. Among the various effectors, mDia and ROCK are two best-described effectors that are important for RhoA-mediated regulation of cancer cell invasion/metastasis by stabilizing adherens junctions, regulating myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) phosphorylation and focal adhesion dynamics. It remains to be determined if RhoA inhibits breast cancer cell metastasis by targeting adherens junctions, MLC2 phosphorylation, and/or focal adhesions.In addition to cancer cell-autonomous functions, continuous heterotypic communications between cancer cells, ECM, and their surrounding non-malignant cells are also vital for disease progression and metastatic dissemination. Fibroblasts are the most common non-malignant cells in the tumor. In normal tissues, they usually exist in a resting/quiescent state and are activated in response to a plethora of signaling cues. Activated fibroblasts are highly proliferative and metabolically active and identified by their expression of markers like \u03b1-SMA and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Activated fibroblasts in tumor stroma are termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally pro-tumorigenic with a dynamic and complex secretory phenotype including ECM molecules (tenascin C, collagen), growth factors (VEGFA, PDGF, HGF), cytokines, and chemokines (TNF, IFN\u03b3, CXCL12, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8). Using the 4T1 triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we observed an inverse correlation between RhoA expression and infiltration of \u03b1-SMA positive CAFs. Consistent with increased infiltrated CAFs, RhoA knockdown tumors were also highly enriched with CAFs-secreted CXCL12. The reduced RhoA activity resulted in increased expression of the cognate receptor, CXCR4, for CXCL12 in 4T1 cancer cells.CAFs-secreted CXCL12 drives tumor progression and metastasis through two possible mechanisms. It mediates the chemotactic recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) to promote tumor angiogenesis. It may also enhance the invasive capacity of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells through paracrine stimulation. Since RhoA knockdown had no observable effect on tumor angiogenesis, it is possible that the increased CXCL12 expression might drive the paracrine stimulation of the RhoA knockdown cancer cells\u2019 invasiveness. Therefore, our study suggests that RhoA suppresses breast cancer cell metastatic dissemination by suppressing the invasiveness of tumor cells through reduced expression of the tumor CXCR4 receptor with a subsequent reduction of CAFs in the TME.Similarly, RhoA knockdown primary tumors displayed a significant F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration. This was correlated with an increased expression of stromal-derived CCL5, a well-established chemokine important in recruiting and converting CCR5 positive monocytes into TAMs. In addition to CCR5, monocytes also express CCR2, which is the main receptor for another important immune cell recruiting chemokine CCL2. The expression of CCR5, the cognate receptor for CCL5 was likewise found to be upregulated in RhoA knockdown 4T1 cancer cells. However, the effects of RhoA knockdown on CCR2 expression is not as significant as the effects on CCR5 (unpublished results). It is therefore possible that the upregulation of CCR5 but not CCR2 expression is the major cause of increased F4/80 positive macrophage infiltration in RhoA knockdown tumors. In addition to CXCL12, CAFs were also a source of increased CCL5 expression in RhoA knockdown tumors. It is therefore likely that the increased co-expression of CXCR4 and CCR5 in RhoA knockdown cancer cells facilitates the recruitment of CXCL12/CCL5 secreting CAFs and later the TAMs into the TME. Like CAFs, TAMs have been shown to be pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic. Since RhoA knockdown tumors with significant CAFs and TAMs infiltration showed relatively increased lymph node and lung metastases formation, it is therefore possible that reduced RhoA activity in tumor cells promotes its metastatic dissemination by activating both the CXCL12-CXCR4 and CCL5-CCR5 signaling pathways.Metastatic dissemination and distant colonization are inefficient processes with multiple sequential steps. The systemic metastasis of breast cancer was long thought to be through the intratumoral and peritumoral blood vasculature, even though lymph node metastasis was often associated with tumor aggressiveness and poorer prognosis. It was long believed that LN metastases enter systemic circulation by traveling from SLN to the next through efferent lymphatics until they drain into the thoracic duct and through the neck lympho-vascular anastomosis into the internal jugular vein. However, recent studies using intravital imaging, photo-switchable protein, and cancer cell micro-infusion showed that cancer cells in the SLN are a significant source for distant lung metastases and lymph node-residing tumor cells disseminate by efficiently invading LN blood vasculature rather than by transiting through efferent lymphatic vessels. In the present study, we detected more cancer cells in the SLNs but not in the contralateral lymph nodes of RhoA knockdown mice compared to the control group. Cancer cells tail-vein injection experiments designed to bypass the early steps revealed no difference in cancer cells extravasation and lung colonization between RhoA knockdown and control groups. Taken together, our study suggest that RhoA suppresses the cancer cells\u2019 initial steps of local invasion into SLNs, and subsequent intravasation into LN blood vasculature while has no observable role in the later steps of the metastasis cascade.Knockdown of RhoA expression increases CCR5 and CXCR4 transcripts in 4T1 cancer cells suggesting a possible transcription-regulatory function of RhoA. RhoA GTPases are known for its functions in cytoskeleton dynamics, regulating cell polarity and cell migration and cell cycle progression. However, a lesser-known function of RhoA is its ability to regulate several transcriptional signaling pathways such as NF\u03baB signaling, GATA-4 signaling, CREB signaling, STAT5a signaling and AP-1 signaling. Rho regulates the transcriptional activity of NF\u03baB by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, and in breast and prostate cancer cells, NF\u03baB directly upregulates CXCR4 mRNA expression and stability. Although NF-\u03baB has a stimulatory role in regulating chemokines expression in general, it is still conceivable that RhoA negatively regulates NF-\u03baB by decreasing the expression of coactivators required for optimal activity of NF-\u03baB. Similarly, it was also reported that Rho GTPases could modulate the activity of CREB, and CCR5 is a well-established transcriptional target of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway. Therefore, it is possible that RhoA suppresses CCR5 and CXCR4 expression by impinging on one or more of these transcriptional signaling pathways. In a recent study, Georgouli et al. reported the pivotal role of RhoA-ROCK signaling in driving fast rounded-amoeboid migration in cancer cells during metastasis in a melanoma mouse model. Mechanistically upregulation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in melanoma cancer cells stimulates the transcription and secretion of an entire cytokine transcriptional program that controls immune cell recruitment into the tumor environment. At present, it is not clear whether the pro-metastatic effect of RhoA is RhoA-effector or cancer type specific.In summary, using a triple negative breast cancer mouse model, we demonstrated that reduced RhoA expression increases breast cancer lymph node and lung metastasis. Potential tumor and metastasis suppressive ability of RhoA in breast cancer have been suggested before. But the current study demonstrated that this is achieved by promoting a pro-tumor microenvironment, with increased CAF and macrophage infiltration, and by modulating the CCL5-CCR5 and CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine axes at the primary tumor. To our knowledge, this is the first such mechanistic study in breast cancer, shows the ability of RhoA to suppresses chemokine receptor expression in breast tumor cells, in turn suppressing the breast cancer LN and lung metastasis.Materials and MethodsCell cultureBT20 and MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, HyClone, UT, USA) with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, GA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (HyClone), and the 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line was cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS, 5% calf serum (Lonza, Switzerland) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C in 5% CO2. 4T1 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Fred Miller (Karmanos Cancer Institute, MI), and MDA-MB231 cells and BT20 cells were purchased from ATCC.Clonogenic growth assayBT20 (1500 cells/well) and MDA-MB231 (2500 cells/well) cells were plated on a 6 well plate in triplicates and grown for 10 days before staining. For PD0325901 (CAS# 391210-10-9) treatment, BT20 and MDA-MB231 cells were plated with 2\u2009\u00b5M and 10\u2009\u00b5M of PD0325901 respectively, for 10 days before staining. Cells were fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution and stained in a 0.5% crystal violet for 24\u2009hours before being washed with 1x PBS and imaged. The analysis was done with ImageJ software (NIH).Immunofluorescence with Ki67Cells were plated on laminin-coated (Sigma, MO, USA) glass coverslips and grown until the desired confluency. Next, they were fixed with 100% methanol for 10\u2009min, and incubated with anti-Ki67 antibody (SC-15402, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), Alexa Fluor\u00ae 546 secondary antibody (1:5000, ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and DRAQ5\u00ae (1:2000, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) nuclear stain. Fluorescence images were captured with a Leica TCS SP5 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope and analyzed with ImageJ software.ImmunohistochemistryFFPE sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated with an ethanol gradient. Antigen retrieval was performed with citrate buffer (pH 6) and tissues were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) for 2\u2009hours. Overnight primary antibody incubations were carried out with Ki67 (SC-15402, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), CD-19 (bs-4755R, Bioss, MA, USA), CK8 (TROMA-I, deposited to DSHB by Brulet, P./ Kemler, R.), E-cadherin (3195, Cell Signaling, MA, USA), GFP (ab290, Abcam, MA, USA), CD31 (ab28364, Abcam), F4/80 (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), \u03b1-SMA (19245, Cell Signaling), CCR5 (ab65850, Abcam), CXCR4 (MAB21651, R&D systems, MN, USA), CCL5 (AP-20618, Acris, MD, USA) and CXCL12 (MAB350, R&D systems). Sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) and ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories) and developed with DAB reagent (Sigma). Finally, they were counterstained with hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific, NH, USA), dehydrated with an ethanol gradient, and mounted with Permount\u2122 (Fisher Scientific). Whole slides were scanned with an Olympus slide scanner. To quantify the IHC positive signal, ImageJ software was used. Briefly, ten random fields of view (FOV) were captured from each tumor section while avoiding necrotic and non-tumor areas. Positive signal area or positive number of cells were measured using the ImageJ for each FOV. The average positive signal area or positive number of cells were reported as positive area or positive number of cell per tumor FOV. For co-localization studies, after primary antibody incubation, sections were incubated with corresponding Alexa Fluor\u00ae secondary antibodies (1:2000, 1\u2009hour, ThermoFisher) and DRAQ5\u00ae (1:2000, 10\u2009minutes, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) nuclear stain. Fluorescence images were captured with a Leica TCS SP5 multiphoton laser scanning confocal microscope.In vitro Matrigel Invasion assayThe PET membranes (8\u2009\u00b5m pore size) of FluoroBlok\u2122 cell culture inserts (351152, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with 90\u2009\u00b5L of diluted Matrigel (0.3\u2009mg/ml) (356234, Corning), and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u20133\u2009hours until solidified. Next, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 of 4T1, BT20 or MDA-MB231 cells suspended in serum-free DMEM media were seeded on the solidified Matrigel layer. Then, 700\u2009\u00b5L of chemo-attractant medium (DMEM, 1% P/S and 10% FBS) was added to the lower chambers (353504, multiwell 24 well companion plate, Corning), and the plate was incubated in a 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator. After 24\u2009hours of incubation, the insert bottoms were dipped in 1X PBS and stained in diluted Calcein AM (354217, Corning) in PBS for 10\u2009min. Fluorescence images of invaded cells were captured with an EVOS inverted microscope, and analysis was done with ImageJ software.Mammary fat pad injection for spontaneous metastasis assayThe detailed procedure for mammary fat pad injection was reported before. For all our studies, BALB/c female mice (Taconic, NY, USA) of 5 weeks old were used and 100 000 of 4T1 GFP-LUC control knockdown and RhoA knockdown cells were injected. After 29 days of injections, whole animals were imaged for luciferase bioluminescence (BLI) with a Xenogen IVIS system as follows: Fresh D-luciferin (LUCK-1G, GoldBio, MO, USA) working solution of 15\u2009mg/ml was prepared in 1x PBS, and it was filter sterilized. Mice were inoculated with a 10\u2009\u00b5l of luciferin solution per gram of body weight as an IP injection. After 10\u2009min, they were anesthetized with Isoflurane and imaged. Images were processed and quantified with a Living Image 3.2 software.After 30 days of injections, mice were euthanized, and blood and tissues were collected and processed for RNA or FFPE histology analysis. Macro-metastases on the lung surface were imaged and counted.The Department of Laboratory Animal Resources at the University of Toledo Health Science Campus is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) and operates in full compliance with the OLAW/PHS policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the USDA Animal Welfare Act. All animal protocols used in this study were approved by the University of Toledo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations in the approved protocols.Experimental metastasis assayTail vein (IV) injections for experimental metastasis were performed as reported before. For our studies, 200 000 of 4T1 GFP-LUC control knockdown and RhoA knockdown cells were tail vein injected. Whole animals were imaged on days 1, 7 and 14 for BLI as described above. After 19 days of injections, mice were euthanized, and lungs were harvested and ex vivo BLI were performed as follows: Fresh D-luciferin working solution of 300\u2009\u00b5g/ml was prepared in 1x PBS. Lungs were soaked in 1\u2009ml of luciferin solution for 5\u2009min in a 24 well plate and imaged with a Xenogen IVIS system. Images were processed and quantified with a Living Image 3.2 software.Real-time PCR analysisTotal RNA samples were prepared from cultured cells and mice tumor tissue samples with Qiagen\u2122 RNA preparation kits. These RNAs were used to synthesize cDNA (M-MLV kit, Invitrogen, MA, USA). Real-time PCR reactions were performed with SyBR green reagent (Qiagen, MD, USA) and appropriate RT-PCR primers. Primer details are as follows; mCXCR4 F-GACTGGCATAGTCGGCAATG, R-AGAAGGGGAGTGTGATGACAAA; mCCR5 F-TTTTCAAGGGTCAGTTCCGAC, R-GGAAGACCATCATGTTACCCAC; mCXCL12 F-TGCATCAGTGACGGTAAACCA, R-TTCTTCAGCCGTGCAACAATC; mCCL5 F-GCTGCTTTGCCTACCTCTCC, R-TCGAGTGACAAACACGACTGC; mCYCLOPHILLINA F-GAGCTGTTTGCAGACAAAGTTC, R-CCCTGGCACATGAATCCTGG; m\u03b2-ACTIN F-ATCTGGCACCAGACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG, R-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC.Western blottingTotal cell lysates were prepared with the lysis buffer (20\u2009mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100), and proteins were separated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Then, separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked and incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in PBS (pH 7.4), 0.2% Tween-20, 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.002% sodium azide. Primary antibodies used for western analyses were RhoA (1:1000, Cell Signaling) and tubulin (1:2000, Sigma). Then, they were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000, Cell Signaling) and developed with Immobilon western chemiluminescence substrate (Millipore) in a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc EQ system.Statistical analysisStatistical calculations with two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test were done using GraphPad Prism software.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

These in vitro interactions may reflect events involved in early tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization, and may represent a new mechanism whereby cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth.IntroductionIt is well-established that stromal cells are hijacked by a developing tumor to generate a tumor-specific stroma that, in turn, promotes cancer progression and metastasis. Fibroblasts within the tumor stroma, referred to as \u201ccancer-associated fibroblasts\u201d or CAFs, exhibit a cancer-associated phenotype and have been demonstrated to be major players in cancer progression. Mechanisms whereby CAFs promote tumor progression and metastasis include: 1) extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by upregulation of the proteoglycan syndecan I and alterations in collagen composition and 2) secretion of soluble growth factors or cytokines that support cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migration. In addition, CAFs may facilitate metastasis by direct contact with cancer cells. The relationship between cancer cells and fibroblasts in tumorigenesis is, therefore, reciprocal.Here we have explored reciprocal signaling and physical interactions between breast cancer-derived tumorigenic cells (MDA-MB-231) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) as well as between MDA-MB-231 cells and human primary mammary fibroblasts (HPMFs) in a 3D Matrigel environment in which cancer cells, but not normal cells, aggregate. Aggregates then coalesce to form large aggregates with shapes reflective of their tumor of origin. We found that breast tumor cells release an activation factor(s) that causes changes in both dermal and mammary fibroblast shape and motility, and alterations in gene expression. Although the altered gene expression pattern differs between activated dermal and activated mammary fibroblasts, both types of activated fibroblasts markedly accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence relative to unconditioned fibroblasts. Interestingly, activated mammary fibroblasts are even more effective at inducing coalescence of MDA-MB-231than activated NHDFs.The activated fibroblasts, referred to here as cancer cell conditioned-normal human dermal fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) or cancer cell conditioned-human primary mammary fibroblasts (CC-HPMFs), are imbued with the capacity to invade the 3D Matrigel environment where they accelerate the rate of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence. We found that this acceleration is mediated by 1) soluble factors released by activated fibroblasts and 2) by the dynamic participation of CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, which function as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 aggregation. We further demonstrate that overexpressing podoplanin (PDPN), but not fibroblast activation protein (FAP), in NHDFs in the absence of the soluble activators from cancer cell-conditioned medium, activates fibroblasts, and imbues them with the capacity to accelerate cancer cell aggregation and coalescence.The functions described here for activated fibroblasts are distinct from the roles typically attributed to CAFs such as promotion of metastasis by basement membrane remodeling and stimulation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our data support a model in which CAFs drive coalescence, and by so doing, may promote tumorigenesis, particularly in cases of field cancerization.Material and methodsGrowth and maintenance of cell lines and primary cellsNormal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and Fibroblast Growth Medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (FGM), insulin (5\u03bcg/mL) and FGF-2 (1ng/mL) were obtained from PromoCell (http://www.promocell.com/) and cells were cultured as specified by the supplier. Human Primary Mammary Fibroblasts (HPMFs), HPMF growth media (HPMF-GM), the Fibroblast Medium Supplement Kit (FBS, hydrocortisone, L-glutamine, FGF and an antibiotic-anti-mycotic solution) and gelatin coating solution were obtained from Cell Biologics (http://www.cellbiologics.net). HPMF cells were cultured in HPMF-GM with the added supplements for 6\u20137 passages as specified by the supplier. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured for 12\u201315 passages in MCF media. MCF medium is DMEM/F12 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% horse serum, human recombinant EGF, insulin, hydrocortisone and cholera toxin, all obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and penicillin-streptomycin from Thermo -Fisher (Grand Island, NY). GFP tagged human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs-GFP) were obtained from Angio-proteomie (www.angioproteomie.com) and cultured according to the supplier\u2019s directions.Activation of fibroblasts by MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium and assay preparationsTo generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblast growth media (CC-FGM), MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in 10 mL of FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum (Fig 1A1). The CC-FGM medium was then withdrawn from the culture flask and filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm filter to remove any detached MDA-MB-231cells or cell debris. To generate cancer cell conditioned fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs) (Fig 1B1), NHDFs were grown for 72 hours to 70\u201380% confluency in the filtered CC-FGM plus 30% fresh FGM. As a control, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency in FGM containing 2% fetal calf serum for 72 hours to generate fibroblast conditioned FGM (F-FGM) (Fig 1A2). The F-FGM was collected and filtered in the same manner as the CC-FGM. Next, NHDFs were grown to 70\u201380% confluency for 72 hours in the filtered F-FGM to generate fibroblast cell conditioned fibroblasts (F-NHDFs) (Fig 1B2). Cancer cell conditioned HPMFs (CC-HPMFs) and fibroblast cell conditioned HPMFs (F-HPMFs) were generated using this same protocol with HPMF-GM. To determine if results were specific to one formula of media, reciprocal media controls were performed by culturing HPMFs in MCF media and CC-MCF media, again following the protocol illustrated in Fig 1. To determine if growth factors in the growth media were responsible for stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cancer cells to condition the media, minimal conditioned media (CC- minimal MCF) was prepared by culturing MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in MCF media without insulin or EGF and supplemented with 10% serum that had been charcoal stripped to remove growth factors (https://www.atlanta-biologicals.com). Finally, as an additional control, fibroblasts were grown in FGM or HPMF-GM that had not been conditioned by either MDA-MB-231 cells or by fibroblasts.The preparation used to analyze fibroblast cell motility and to compare the effects of F-NHDFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs on the aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.To prepare samples for 2D analysis of fibroblast motility, the 30 mm glass insert in a 60 mm Petri dish (https://www.cellvis.com/) was pre-coated with Type I human collagen (https://www.advancedbiomatrix.com) according to the supplier\u2019s instructions. Next, a 500 \u03bcl aliquot containing 5 x 104 NHDFs in FGM, F-NHDFs in F-FGM, CC-NHDFs in CC-FGM, HPMFs in HPMF-GM, F-HPMFs in F-HPMF-GM, or CC-HPMFs in CC-HPMF-GM was dispersed onto the collagen-coated insert. Cells were allowed to adhere for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1C) followed by addition of 5 ml of the appropriate media. To assay coalescence in 2D and 3D in the presence of fibroblasts, fibroblasts were first plated on the collagen-coated insert as described above. MDA-MB-231 cells were then harvested and 5x105 cells in 250 \u03bcl of medium were mixed with ice-cold Matrigel (Fig 1C) as described elsewhere in detail. Medium was removed from the collagen-coated insert and 750 \u03bcl of the cell/Matrigel mixture were gently applied over the fibroblasts (Fig 1D). The Matrigel was allowed to gel by incubating the dishes for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 and 5 ml of MCF media was then added. 2D and 3D images were acquired on a microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 (Fig 1E).2D analysis of fibroblast cell shape and motilityFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert of a Petri dish as described above. 2D images at 4x or 10x magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Illumination and acquisition were synchronized using Fire-I software (www.unibrain.com/products/fire-i-software/). A series of JPEG images were acquired every 45 seconds with a XCD-V50 camera (Sony, San Diego, CA). The images were imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and compiled into JDIAS movie format for motion and shape analysis. Cells were outlined at 7.5 minute intervals for 6 hours. Stacked perimeter plots were generated and length, width, perimeter, area and instantaneous velocity calculated as described previously. J3D-DIAS4.2 calculates persistence as the ratio of net to total path length at 5 frame intervals and averaged over the total path length.2D and 3D analysis of MDA-MB-231 aggregation and aggregate coalescence in the presence of NHDF, F-NHDF, F-HPMF, CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cellsNHDFs, F-NHDF, HPMFs, F-HPMFs, CC-NHDFs or CC-HPMFs were plated onto the collagen-coated insert and overlayed with a Matrigel/MDA-MB-231 cell suspension as described above. 2D images at 4X and 10X magnification were acquired through an Olympus CK2 microscope housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. For 3D analyses of coalescence with DIC optics, a lid with a glass insert was used to cover the dish. 3D cultures were imaged through a 20x objective using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) optics on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with a motor-driven stage synchronized to a Zeiss AxioCam MRc5 IEEE 1394 color CCD camera and an LED light source. The microscope was housed in an incubator at 37\u00b0in 5% CO2. A z-series of optical sections was acquired through the preparation at 10 \u03bcm increments and this process repeated every 10 minutes for up to 5 days. The z-series was imported into J3D-DIAS4.2 and saved in movie format for 3D reconstructions, as previously described.ImmunostainingFibroblasts were plated on the collagen-coated insert (described above) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C in 5% CO2 before addition of 5 mL of media to the dish. After 24 hours, the preparation was rinsed with PBS and immunostained as described previously. Cells were stained with the anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (mAb) AMF-17b (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, (DSHB) http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) diluted 1:10 in PBS, or the rat anti-human podoplanin mAb NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) diluted 1:200 in PBS. The AMF-17b preparation was stained with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and the NZ-1 preparation with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).qRT-PCRFor RNA preparations, conditioned and unconditioned fibroblast cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in RNAlater solution (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated for 1 hour at 4\u00b0C. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). The TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was employed to remove DNA. The quality of the RNA was confirmed with the Experion RNA StdSens and HighSens Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad) that assigned an RNA Quality Index (RQI) >9.5 for our samples, indicating little to no RNA degradation had occurred. To generate cDNA from the RNA samples, the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) was used, as recommended by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR assays were performed with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche) using 50 ng of the cDNA. The expression levels of the genes of interest were quantified using a Roche LightCycler480 real-time PCR detection system with SYBR green. The qRT-PCR assay for each of the tested genes was repeated three times, each in triplicate. The relative expression level of the genes was normalized to that of GAPDH. Primer pairs used for qRT-PCR are listed in S1 Table.Western blot analysis of cell lysates and mediaWestern analysis of protein from cell lysates was performed as previously described. Rat anti-podoplanin NZ-1 (AngiobioCo., San Diego, CA) and mouse anti-FAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC) were employed as primary antibodies. Mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin mAb E7 (DSHB; http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu) was used as a loading control. To assess the release of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, media were concentrated with Amicon Ultra 3K centrifugal filter devices (Merck Millipore Ltd.) according to the supplier\u2019s protocol. Recombinant human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 (R&D Systems; https://www.rndsystems.com) was used as a positive control. Rabbit anti-human SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect the cytokine. IRDye 800-conjugated goat anti-rat, goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used as secondary antibodies. Odyssey scanner and software were used for detection and quantification of immunoblots (Li-Cor Biosciences).Transwell assay with NHDF cellsA Corning Incorporated Transwell plate with 24 mm inserts, the latter constructed from 0.4 \u03bcm pore membranes (https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en.html), was used to test whether conditioned fibroblasts released a soluble factor capable of traversing the membrane to affect MDA-MB-231 cell behavior in the absence of fibroblast/cancer cell-cell contact. The plate well was first pre-coated with 100 \u03bcl of Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted to 1\u00d7106 cells per ml in MCF medium, chilled on ice, and a 500 \u03bcl aliquot mixed with 1 ml of ice-cold Matrigel. The chilled MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then inoculated into the pre-coated well. F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cultures, containing 4\u00d7104 cells, were suspended in 400 \u03bcl of F-FGM or CC-FGM medium, respectively, and spread on the insert filter over an empty well. The plate was then allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C to allow for gelation of the Matrigel as well as attachment of the fibroblasts to the insert filter. Media were removed from the inserts and the inserts transferred on to wells containing the MDA-MB-231 cell/Matrigel mixture. The transwell preparation was incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to allow gelation of the Matrigel, followed by addition of 2.5 ml of MCF medium to each well. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. To confirm that fibroblasts could not migrate through the insert filter, the transwell assay was performed using NHDF cells in the absence of MDA-MB-231 cells and the bottom well examined microscopically.Development of NHDF overexpression strainsTo overexpress human PDPN and FAP genes transiently in NHDFs, we constructed plasmids pPDPN-C3 and pFAP-C3. To construct the overexpression plasmids, the PDPN and FAP genes were amplified by PCR from the plasmids containing human PDPN cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=443900) and human FAP cDNA (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/GetCloneDetail.do?cloneid=43440) with the primer pairs PDPN-1/-2 and FAP-1/-2, respectively. The PCR amplified coding regions of the genes were cloned under the control of CMV promoter in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 (BD Bioscienes Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) by enzyme restriction with AgeI and SalI and followed by ligation. To generate a control expression plasmid pmCherry-C3, the EGFP coding region in the plasmid pEGFP-C3 was swapped with the mCherry gene that was amplified from a plasmid with mCherry by PCR with primer pair mCherry-1/-2. Primer pairs used for generating the overexpression and control plasmids are listed in S1 Table. All sequences of the genes were verified after cloning. To generate PDPN and FAP overexpression strains, NHDF-PDPNoe and NHDF-FAPoe transfections of the plasmids into NHDF cells were performed using FuGENE transfection reagent (www.promega.com) according to the supplier\u2019s specifications and confirmed by positive expression of mCherry.Treatment of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN mAbmAb NZ-1, described above, was affinity purified using a Protein G HP spin trap column (GE Healthcare, Cat.#28903134) and concentrated using an ultra-centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore, Cat.# UFC905024). The concentration was measured by a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) and 0.67 \u03bcg added to 4x104 F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs in 200 \u03bcl of medium. The preparations were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The contents of each tube were then divided equally between two collagen-coated wells. As controls, mAb in 200 \u03bcl PBS was processed similarly in the absence of cells. The plates were then incubated for 30 minutes at 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. An MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixture was then cast over the fibroblast cell layer as described above. Images were acquired daily for four days using the 10X objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope.MMP Gelatinase Zymography and treatment with MMP inhibitorSterile-filtered media were diluted 1:1 with zymogram sample buffer (BioRad) and 20 \u03bcl loaded into each well of a Tris-Glycine Novex 10% zymogram protein gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). SDS-Page gels were run at 118V constant voltage for 90 minutes. Gelatinase activity was detected following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Images of the gel demonstrating cleared regions of enzymatic activity were captured using a light box and Nikon CoolPix camera. Digital images were quantitated using ImageJ software. NHDFs were cultured in CC-FGM with or without 50 \u03bcM of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (http://www.emdmillipore.com) for 72 hours.Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12, anti- SDF-1-\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb and IL-6Recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and human/mouse SDF-1\u03b1 /CXCL12 mAb were obtained from R&D Systems (https://www.rndsystems.com) and reconstituted according to the supplier\u2019s specifications. MDA-MB-231 cells were grown for 24 hours in 10 ml of MCF media supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the reconstituted protein or supplemented with 3 \u03bcg of the protein plus 25 \u03bcg of the anti-SDF-1\u03b1 mAb. To test the effect of IL-6 on MDA-MB-231s, cells were grown for 24 hours in MCF medium supplemented with 50 ng/mL of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6, www.peprotech.co). To test the effect of rIL-6 on MDA-MB-231 cells, the rIL-6 treated MDA-MB-231 cells were embedded in 3D Matrigel as previously described. Images of 10 fields were taken at 24 hour intervals using a 4X objective.ResultsBreast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates NHDFs and alters gene expressionTo determine if treatment of fibroblasts with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells altered the shape and motility of the fibroblasts, NHDF cells were treated with cancer cell conditioned or fibroblast cell conditioned media as described in the Methods. A comparison of F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, fixed on a collagen substrate and stained with the anti-vimentin mAb AMF-1b, revealed markedly different morphologies (Fig 2 A and 2B). F-NHDFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 2A), whereas CC-NHDFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 2B). On a collagen-coated 2D substrate, cellular translocation tracks of F-NHDFs were long and persistent, (Fig 2C), while tracks of CC-NHDFs were random and less persistent (Fig 2D). Morphometric measurements revealed that CC-NHDFs were on average significantly longer (Fig 2E), presumably due to the numerous elongated lamellipodia and filopodia, while F-NHDFs were significantly narrower (Fig 2F), and possessed on average a much smaller perimeter (Fig 2G) and a significantly smaller area (Fig 2H), than CC-NHDFs. Instantaneous velocity, computed without directional bias, was similar for CC-NHDFs and F-NHDFs (Fig 2I), but the computed persistence of translocation was significantly higher for F-NHDFs than CC-NHDFs (Fig 2J). These results indicate that factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells alter both the morphology and behavior of dermal fibroblasts.Medium conditioned by the breast tumor-derived cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs affecting polarity, cellular translocation, morphology and gene expression.A, B. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained for vimentin (green) to visualize cell shape, and with DAPI (blue) to visualize nuclei. C-D.

The means and error bar (standard deviations) are presented in all panels for an N = 50. ***** indicates significance of p<0.00005, *** indicates significance p<0.0005, N.S indicates not significant. K. qRT-PCR analyses of the transcript levels of ten genes associated with fibroblast activation. Means and error bars (standard deviations) are presented for N = 3. Asterisk (*) indicates significance of p <0.05. L,M. F-NHDFs and CC-NHDFs, respectively, stained with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1. Arrows denote punctate plasma membrane staining. N. Western blot of F-NHDF and CC-NHDF lysates probed with anti-PDPN mAb NZ-1 and the anti-tubulin mAb E7.Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-NHDFs, expression of ten genes previously demonstrated to be involved in fibroblast activation and/or motility was assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The genes included vimentin (VIM), PDPN, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (ACTA), the tyrosine kinase discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2), desmin (DES), FAP, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB), Ca++ binding protein (FSP1/S100A4), and syndecan1 (SDC1). Five of the genes, PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB were up-regulated in CC-NHDFs by more than two-fold (Fig 2K). PDPN was upregulated nine-fold and FAP ten-fold (Fig 2K). F-NHDF cells did not stain with the anti-podoplanin mAb (Fig 2L), but CC-NHDF cells stained intensely (Fig 2M, arrows). Western blot analysis supported the fluorescence data, demonstrating that PDPN was expressed in CC-NHDFs, but not in F-NHDFs (Fig 2N). Western blot analyses of FAP revealed that it was present in F-NHDFs, and the level increased several fold in CC-NHDFs (S1A Fig). Therefore, factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells induce changes in NHDF gene expression consistent with fibroblast activation.CC-NHDF cells accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescenceIn the experimental protocol employed, in the absence of a fibroblast substratum, cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence (hereafter referred to as \u201caggregation and coalescence\u201d) occurred slowly over 192 hours. At 72 hours, cells had moved through the gel, forming small aggregates (Fig 3A, arrows). Aggregation and coalescence continued so that by 144 hours, the great majority of cells in the field resided in a few large aggregates, and the surrounding Matrigel was depleted of single cells as previously described. When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast over F-NHDFs, the rates of aggregation and coalescence were similar (Fig 3A, arrows). When MDA-MB-231 cells were cast in Matrigel over CC-NHDFs, aggregation and coalescence occurred at a dramatically accelerated rate, forming large aggregates by 72 hours (Fig 3A, arrows), at least four-fold greater than preparations cast over F-NHDF cells. Quantitative analysis of the size of aggregates in 10 different fields of duplicate 72 hour cultures confirmed these differences (Fig 3B). The median area of MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates formed over CC-NHDFs was more than four-fold larger than those formed over F-NHDFs (Fig 3B).CC-NHDFs but not F-NHDFs accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.A. Representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase is cast over the substrate in the absence of fibroblasts, over F-NHDF cells on collagen and over CC-NHDF cells on collagen. Red arrows indicate MDA-MB-231 aggregates. B. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-NHDF cells (blue) or CC-NHDF cells (orange). The median area of each population is noted as a blue or orange arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-NHDF when compared to F-NHDFs.CC-NHDFs attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds in the 3D model2D imaging suggested that accelerated aggregation and coalescence was more pronounced in the Matrigel region closest to the CC-NHDF substratum. To explore this observation, we used the 3D reconstruction software J3D-DIAS4.2. In Fig 4A and 4B, side views of reconstructions are presented of a MDA-MB-231/Matrigel preparation cast over F-NHDF and CC-NHDF substrates. Fibroblasts are color-coded yellow and MDA-MB-231 cells and aggregates color-coded red. The MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates over the F-NHDF substratum remained dispersed throughout the 3D Matrigel matrix after 24 hours (Fig 4A), whereas MDA-MB-231 cells and small aggregates accumulated in the Matrigel region closest to the interface with the CC-NHDF substratum (Fig 4B, white arrows). The F-NHDF or CC-NHDF cells were distinguishable from the MDA-MB-231 cells over time by visually monitoring the optical sections collected every 10 minutes.CC-NHDF cells attract MDA-MB-231 cells and function as scaffolds to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of cancer cells.A, B. Side views of 3D reconstructions of MDA-MB-231 cells (red) in Matrigel cast over NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen or CC-NHDF cells (yellow) on collagen, respectively, after 24 hours of incubation. Arrows point to MDA-MB-231 aggregates forming at or near the collagen/Matrigel interface and in physical contact with CC-NHDFs. C. 3D of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) over a 21 hour period, with both cell types tracked by analyzing the optical section stacks at 10 minute intervals. D. 3D reconstructions of CC-NHDFs (yellow) and MDA-MB-231 cells (red) between 50 and 60 hours of incubation. Reconstructions were performed with J3D-DIAS4.2 software.To further investigate the interactions between CC-NHDFs and MDA-MB-231 cells in the 3D Matrigel environment, we reconstructed single cells and clusters of cells using J3D-DIAS4.2. In the first reconstructions in Fig 4C, a CC-NHDF cell (yellow, 1), at the CC-NHDF-MDA-MB-231/Matrigel interface at 0 hours moved in a directed fashion (arrow) towards an MDA-MB-231 cell (red, 1) between 0 and 3 hours. At 5.5 hours, the CC-NHDF contacted MDA-MB-231 cell 1, changed direction, and migrated towards a developing aggregate, with MDA-MB-231 cell 1 in tow (Fig 4C). During that same time period, two additional MDA-MB-231 cells, (red 2 and 3), in contact with another CC-NHDF cell, moved in the direction of CC-NHDF cell 1, and by 21 hours, MDA-MB-231 cells 1, 2 and 3 had aggregated around several CC-NHDF cells, including CC-NHDF cell 1 (Fig 4C). In a second reconstruction in a later time period, shown in Fig 4D, MDA-MB-231 cells (red) aggregated using CC-NHDF cells (yellow), as scaffolds. These behaviors were observed in additional regions optically sectioned in a similar fashion in multiple preparations.CC-NHDFs penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlayIn examining optical sections, it also appeared that CC-NHDFs, but not F-NHDFs, penetrated the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay. To explore this observation, the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixtures were cast over NHDF-GFP cells treated with either fibroblast conditioned medium (\u201cF-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d) or MDA-MB-231-conditioned medium (\u201cCC-NHDF-GFP cells\u201d). DIC and fluorescent images were obtained at different distances through the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase after 72 hours of incubation. No F-NHDF-GFP cells were observed through 5 to 45 \u03bcm of the Matrigel phase (Fig 5A). However, CC-NHDF-GFP cells, were observed extending at least 30 \u03bcm into the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase (Fig 5B). After 96 hours, CC-NHDF-GFP cells (green) were enmeshed in the MDA-MB-231 cell aggregates within the Matrigel overlay (Fig 5C).CC-NHDFs act as scaffolds and penetrate MDA-MB-231 aggregates to support and facilitate aggregation.A. F-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer do not penetrate the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel overlay after 72 hours of incubation. B. CC-NHDF-GFP cells in the basal layer penetrate through at least 30 \u03bcm of the MB-231/Matrigel upper phase after 72 hours of incubation. Fluorescent images were combined with phase contrast images at ascending depths through the upper phase. Cells or their projections are numbered. C. Optical sections of an aggregate at 96 hours of culture formed in the Matrigel phase of a preparation in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells were plated on the collagen substratum. The fluorescent images of the CC-NHDFs and the phase DIC images of all the cells are merged for each optical section.A quantitative analysis was performed to verify that CC-NHDF cells had a greater propensity to invade the Matrigel and incorporate into MDA-MB-231 aggregates than F-NHDF cells. An examination of 10 independent aggregates at 172 hours in preparations containing F-NHDF-GFP cells revealed F-NHDF-GFP cells in 23% of MDA-MB-231 aggregates. The average number of F-NHDF-GFP cells within the 23% of aggregates containing them was 3 \u00b1 1.8. The highest level in the 150 \u03bcm z-series at which F-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 33.6 \u03bcm \u00b1 14.3. In contrast, 100% of the 10 aggregates examined in the CC-NHDF-GFP preparations contained CC-NHDF-GFP with an average number of 54 \u00b1 15 CC-NHDF-GFP cells per aggregate (p<0.005). The average highest level in which CC-NHDF-GFP cells appeared in the aggregates was 100 \u03bcm \u00b1 28.2 (p<0.0005).The role of PDPNBecause PDPN and FAP were upregulated at the transcript level more than nine-fold in CC-NHDFs, we assessed whether upregulation of either played a role in the acquisition of the capacity of CC-NHDFs to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells. To that end, we generated the PDPN and FAP overexpression strains NHDF-PDPN\u0153 and NHDF-FAP\u0153. We then tested whether overexpression of either resulted in activation of NHDF cells, thereby imbuing them with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence in a 3D environment. After 24 hours, there was minimal aggregation of the MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a control NHDF substratum (Fig 6A). In marked contrast, after 24 hours, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel cast over a NHDF-PDPN\u0153 substratum was accelerated (Fig 6B). After 72 hours, while MDA-MB-231 cells over the NHDF cells had formed medium-sized aggregates (Fig 6C), the majority of MDA-MB-231 cells over NHDF-PDPN\u0153 cells had coalesced into large aggregates (Fig 6D). Overexpressing FAP in NHDF cells, however, did not imbue them with the capacity to accelerate (S1B Fig). To further explore the role of PDPN, we tested whether anti-podoplanin mAb NZ-1 affected acceleration. Compared to the coalescence on a substratum of CC-NHDF cells (Fig 6E), NZ-1 reduced the rate of aggregation and coalescence (Fig 6F), reinforcing the conclusion that PDPN plays a central role in the capacity of CC-NHDF cells to accelerate aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells in a 3D environment.Overexpression of podoplanin imbues NHDFs not activated with MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium with the capacity to accelerate aggregation and coalescence, and pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-podoplanin mAb blocks its capacity to accelerate.A. Aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 preparations after 24 hours in which the substratum was NHDF cells on collagen. B. Aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 preparations after 24 hours in which the substratum was NHDF-PDPN\u0153 cells on collagen. C, D.

Aggregation and aggregate coalescence of MDA-MB-231 after 72 hours in which the substratum was either untreated CC-NHDFs (E) or CC-NHDFs pretreated with the anti-podoplanin mAb NZ-1 (F).Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 accelerate aggregation and coalescenceTo test whether CC-NHDFs also release soluble acceleration factors, MDA-MB-231/Matrigel mixtures were cast on the bottom wells in 24 well tissue culture dishes with removable filter inserts. The inserts were overlaid with a suspension of either F-NHDFs or CC-NHDFs and placed over the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase, the latter in the bottom wells (Fig 7A). The MDA-MB-231 cells that were separated from untreated F-NHDF cells underwent coalescence at a far slower rate than MDA-MB-231 cells separated from CC-NHDF cells (Fig 7B) and the aggregates were more spheroid than those formed on CC-NHDF scaffolds. Microscopic scanning revealed that no CC-NHDF cells or lamellipodia had traversed the micropore filter. The transwell experiment therefore demonstrated that, in addition to direct physical interaction, activated fibroblasts also stimulated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells by releasing soluble factors.CC-NHDFs release soluble signals that accelerate aggregation and coalescence.A.

D. Aggregation after 48 hours of MDA-MB-231 preparations over a CC-NHDF substratum in the absence and presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001. E. Western blot of media probed with anti-SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb. Recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 was used as a positive control. F. Coalescence after 48 and 72 hours of untreated MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 plus anti-SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb, and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with rIL-6.One possible candidate for acceleration factors released by activated fibroblasts were the MMPs. The levels of pro-MMP9, MMP9, MMP2 and MMP1, assessed by zymography were 5.5, 5.9, 1.3 and 7.5 fold higher, respectively, in CC-FGM taken after 72 hours on CC-NHDF cells (lane CC-FGM/CC-NHDF) (Fig 7C) than in F-FGM taken after 72 hours on NHDF cells (lane F-FGM). A small amount of pro-MMP2 was present in all samples of FGM, but apart from that weak band, MDA-MB-231 cells did not release detectable levels of MMPs into the CC-FGM (lane CC-FGM/MB-231s) (Fig 7C). Thus, dermal fibroblasts secreted relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media. To confirm these data, we tested whether the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, blocked acceleration of coalescence using the CC-NHDF cells. After 24 hours of incubation, MDA-MB-231 cells in Matrigel overlaying a CC-NHDF substratum had begun to aggregate, but MDA-MB-231 cells overlaid onto CC-NHDF cultures that had been treated with GM6001 remained randomly dispersed (Fig 7D).The chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is also released by activated fibroblasts with reported effects on cancer cell locomotion and metastasis. Our Western blot analysis confirmed that CC-NHDFs released SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 into the media at levels several fold higher than F-NHDFs or MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig 7E). We therefore grew MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 hours in the presence of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 and monitored their subsequent aggregation and coalescence in the 3D Matrigel environment. Accelerated MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and coalescence was noted after 48 hours and was quite evident after 72 hours (Fig 7F). Addition of the anti- SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 mAb to the culture medium containing SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 abrogated the effect (Fig 7F). Finally, we tested whether aggregation and coalescence were directly stimulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by treatment with rIL-6. To that end, rIL-6 was added to the growth medium for 24 hours prior to suspending the treated cells in Matrigel for the coalescence assay. Images acquired following 48 hours in Matrigel showed no effect from rIL-6 treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells, nor was acceleration observed at 72 hours (Fig 7F).Breast cancer cell-conditioned medium activates HPMFs affecting their polarity, morphology, gene expression, ability to accelerate coalescence and MMP releaseIn order to confirm the results obtained with CC-NHDFs, we performed similar experiments with conditioned and unconditioned primary mammary fibroblasts. As was the case with the dermal fibroblasts, dramatic changes in morphologies were noted in CC-HPMFs on a collagen substrate. That is, while F-HPMFs were spindle shaped and bipolar (Fig 8A), similar to F-NHDF cells and consistent with the morphology of young, non-senescent fibroblasts, CC-HPMFs were spread and multipolar (Fig 8B). Next, to determine if factors released by MDA-MB-231 cells altered gene expression in CC-HPMFs, we examined the expression of the same ten genes by qRT-PCR that we assessed in the dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, a different set of genes were upregulated in CC-HPMFs when compared to CC-NHDF cells. These included VIM, DES, FAP, PDFGRA and S100A4 while syndecan I (SDC1) was significantly downregulated (Fig 8 C). Nevertheless, when cast over CC-HPMFs, the rate of coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells far exceeded that observed with CC-NHDFs and was evident as early as 24 hours (Fig 8 D, arrows). In addition, destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer was even more pronounced (Fig 8E, dashed red line) and the area of aggregates appeared significantly greater (Fig 8F, solid red line), an observation that was confirmed by measuring aggregate areas (Fig 8G). To determine if CC-HPMFs, like CC-NHDFs, released elevated MMPs, pro-MMP9, MMP9, pro-MMP2, MMP2 and MMP1 were assessed by gel zymography (Fig 8G). Pro-MMP9 was not detectable in any of the HPMF-GM preparations while pro-MMP2 was present in all samples. MMP9 and MMP2 were only detectable in CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF while MMP1 was not detected in any of the media. Therefore, although dermal and mammary fibroblasts release different collagenase enzymes of the MMP family, both release relatively high levels of MMPs in response to treatment with cancer cell conditioned media.CC-HPMFs exhibit altered morphology, altered gene expression, accelerate MDA-MB-231 coalescence and release elevated MMPs.A, B.

E. Substrate level, 10x magnification of representative fields of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen reveals advanced coalescence and considerably more destruction of the CC-HPMF monolayer (dashed red line) in comparison to F-HPMF monolayer. F. Representative images of aggregating MDA-MB-231 cells cast over F-HPMF cells on collagen and over CC-HPMF cells on collagen at 72 hours at the 50 \u03bcm level demonstrate significantly larger aggregates over the CC-HPMF layer (solid red line) in comparison to the F-HPMF layer. G. Measurements of aggregate areas at 72 hours in cultures in which the MDA-MB-231/Matrigel phase was cast over F-HPMF cells (gray), and CC-HPMF cells (yellow). The median area of each population is noted as a gray or yellow arrow, respectively. The difference between MDA-MB-231 aggregate areas was significantly greater (p< 0.00001) in the presence of CC-HPMFs when compared to F-HPMFs. H. Gel zymogram and quantitation of pixel intensities of MMPs in HPMF-GM directly from the bottle of sterile, unused media (no cells); F-HPMF-GM, media from 72 hour cultures of F-HPMFs; CC-HPMF-GM/MB-231, media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cultures; and CC-HPMF-GM/CC-HPMF, media from 72 hour CC-HPMF cultures.To determine if components specific to the HPMF-GM were stimulating the MDA-MB-231 cells to secrete activating factors into the conditioned medium, we performed the coalescence assay with different varieties of media. First, in a reciprocal media experiment, we conditioned HPMFs with MCF media from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 (CC-MCF). Second, we prepared a minimal MCF medium (CC-minimal MCF) by omitting growth factors and supplementing with serum that had been stripped of growth factors. We then conditioned HPMFs with CC- minimal MCF from 72 hour MDA-MB-231 cells. As controls, we cultured HPMFs in unconditioned MCF and unconditioned minimal MCF. Again, aggregation and coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells were accelerated in the presence of conditioned HPMFs as compared to their unconditioned counterparts with obvious destruction of the fibroblast monolayer, similar to observations in CC-HPMF, with a slight delay at 24 hours in the CC- minimal MCF (S2 Fig). Therefore, secretion of fibroblast stimulatory factors by MDA-MB-231 cells is not media specific, although serum associated cytokines and growth factors, prevalent in the tumor microenvironment, likely enhance their ability to secrete these stimulatory factors.DiscussionBoth in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that CAFs and tumor cells interact to drive tumor progression, leading to several proposed models for reciprocal signaling. Given the significance of reciprocal signaling and the formation of tumors in a 3D environment, we have developed a 3D model to analyze not only signaling, but also physical interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells. We found that MDA-MB-231 cells release a fibroblast activation signal, and that these activated fibroblasts (CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs) then accelerate breast cancer cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by, in turn, releasing soluble factors and also by serving as physical scaffolds for breast cancer cell aggregation (Fig 9). The soluble factors appear to include matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and, in the case of CC-NHDFs, the chemokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12.A model showing how activation of fibroblasts leads to accelerated coalescence of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a 3D Matrigel environment.A. Activation of NHDFs and HPMFs to CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs, respectively, after exposure to a medium conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. B. Physical interactions between MDA-MB-231 cancer cells and CC-fibroblasts occur initially at the collagen 1/Matrigel interface but later throughout the 3D environment with CC-fibroblasts serving as scaffolds for MDA-MB-231 cell coalescence. C. Release of soluble signals by CC-NHDF and CC-HPMF cells accelerates coalescence of MDA-MB-231 cells.NHDF activationFibroblasts can be activated by a number of molecular signals, depending upon body location, developmental circumstances such as embryogenesis, tissue maintenance, wound healing and tumorigenesis. Here, we have demonstrated that medium conditioned by the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 activates NHDFs and HPMFs, transforming them into CAFs with altered morphology, motility and gene expression, most notably, the capacity to accelerate breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment.NHDF activation by MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium resulted in more than a two-fold increase in the expression of five of the ten tested genes, selected for their association with fibroblast activation. The five included PDPN, ACTA, DDR2, FAP and PDGFRB. Because PDPN and FAP were the most dramatically upregulated and also previously implicated in fibroblast activation, we tested whether overexpression of either imbued NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate MDA-MB-231 aggregation and coalescence. Overexpressing PDPN did imbue NHDFs with the capacity to accelerate, but overexpressing FAP did not. In addition, pretreatment of CC-NHDFs with anti-PDPN antibody blocked their capacity to accelerate. These results indicate that PDPN plays a central role in NHDF activation.PDPN has been shown to regulate the Wnt/\u00df-cat signaling pathway, presumably through its interaction with ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family proteins that link cytoskeletal structures to cell membranes. Because PDPN was undetectable in NHDF cells, we assume that the activating factor released by MDA-MB-231 cells does not function through interaction with PDPN, but rather another receptor, and that activation through the Wnt/\u00df-cat pathway results in PDPN upregulation.Suchanski et al (2017) found that PDPN overexpression in fibroblasts co-cultured with cancer cells did not enhance migration or invasion of cancer cells, but did increase the motility of fibroblasts, measured indirectly by the ability of activated fibroblasts to traverse a filter with an 8 \u03bcm pore size. Although we did not see increased velocity in our direct measurements of CC-NHDF cell motility in which PDPN was upregulated, our finding that activation causes shape changes and Matrigel invasion are consistent with their reported increased ability to penetrate a filter.Activation of HPMFs resulted in upregulation of FAP, VIM, DES, PDFGRA and S100A4, while, interestingly, SCDI was significantly downregulated. In contrast to our results, in a study by Liakou et al (2016), SCD1 was upregulated in HPMFs treated for 24 hours with media conditioned by MDA-MB-231 cells. However, we employed a different conditioning protocol and, perhaps more importantly, our conditioning period was considerably longer. Thus, the discrepancy in SCD1 expression may be attributable to fibroblast plasticity and the existence of transitional fibroblast states. The difference is quite likely due to time-dependent changes in gene expression, including transcription factor genes, in a program of differentiation. CAFs are remarkably heterogeneic and transitional states with overlapping gene expression patterns are common in the tumor stroma. The upregulation of VIM, DES, and FAP are features of myofibroblasts. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the longer conditioning period we employed may reflect a myofibroblast-like transitional state, and is consistent with the prevalence of stromal cells with myofibroblast characteristics in epithelial tumors.Acceleration by physical interactionsAlthough numerous studies have focused on diffusible, soluble factors released by CAFs, that promote cancer progression through EMT and the concomitant acquisition of cancer cell motility and metastasis, only a few have examined possible physical interactions between CAFs and cancer cells. Gaggioli et al (2007) showed that CAFs generated tracks in a Matrigel/collagen matrix into which overlying squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCCs) collectively migrated. When CAFs and SCCs were mixed, the leading cell was typically a fibroblast during collective migration of the SCCs. Pretreatment of the matrix with CAFs, followed by removal of CAFs and subsequent seeding of the SCC cells enabled SCC invasion, suggesting that during metastasis, CAFs generated tracks in the matrix that cancer cells subsequently entered. In a later study it was reported that when CAFs and SCCs were co-cultured as spheroids in a Matrigel/collagen matrix, SCC cells followed the CAFs as the cells exited the spheroids. Most relevant to the results presented here, Knuchel et al (2015) demonstrated that fibroblasts promote colorectal cancer (CRC) cell elongation and motility through direct cell-cell interactions, and that adhesion appears to be mediated by FGF-2, FGFR and integrin \u03b1v\u00df5. They also demonstrated that fibroblasts directed CRC cells to exit established CRC spheroids.Our experimental design allowed us to observe dynamic physical interactions between fibroblasts overlayed with cancer cells in a 3D environment in which each cell type was plated in its normal microenvironment; i.e. fibroblasts on collagen and cancer cells of epithelial origin in the basement membrane matrix Matrigel. Our 4D analysis of live cultures revealed that fibroblasts were able to penetrate the matrix, and by 48 hours, functioned as scaffolds for cancer cell aggregation. Movement of MDA-MB-231 cells was directional, towards and along the elongated CC-NHDFs in the process of aggregation. Aggregates enveloped the CC-NHDFs. CC-NHDF migration and scaffolding occurred as much as 70 \u03bcm above the original CC-NHDF/Matrigel boundary. In support of our findings, fibroblasts isolated from the interface zone between breast tumors and stroma actively modulated tumor cell behavior in co-cultures to a greater extent than normal fibroblasts or fibroblasts within the tumor. Importantly, the interactions revealed in our model might occur very early in in vivo tumorigenesis and may explain tumor growth and tumor heterogeneity in cases of field cancerization, a widely documented occurrence in many types of cancers, including breast cancer, in which discrete, multiple islands or foci of neoplastic cells are present within the diseased tissue. Based on an examination of 783 oral tumors, Slaughter suggested that these foci grow independently and eventually coalesce to form a tumor, a suggestion that has been more recently documented in histological analyses of melanoma development in humans.Acceleration of coalescence by soluble factors released by CC-NHDF cellsCC-NHDFs accelerated aggregation and coalescence across the filter in a transwell assay without penetrating the filter, demonstrating that the CC-NHDFs released one or more soluble acceleration factors. However, the aggregates induced by soluble factors alone were far more compact than the aggregates accelerated by CC-NHDF scaffolding. This suggests either that the mechanism of acceleration by soluble factors differs from that mediated by physical scaffolding, or that in the latter case, the CC-NHDFs caused larger but more diffuse aggregates because their presence interfered with compactness of MDA-MB-231 cells. To identify acceleration factors, we tested several molecules reported to be secreted by activated fibroblasts. First, we found that CC-NHDFs and CC-HPMFs release matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are released by activated fibroblasts and remodel ECM, at five to ten times the level of inactivated fibroblasts, and that the MMP inhibitor GM6001 retarded aggregation and coalescence. MMPs, by remodeling the ECM, may facilitate fibroblast and MDA-MB-231 translocation through the 3D matrix, thus accelerating the process of aggregation and coalescence. Secondly, we found that the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 is released by CC-NHDFs and accelerates aggregation and coalescence. SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which has been demonstrated to affect cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, must directly affect MDA-MB-231 behavior, probably through the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 receptor, which has been shown to be expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells.ConclusionBased on the tumor cell-specific characteristics of cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence in a 3D environment, we designed an assay to investigate bidirectional signaling and physical cell-cell interactions of fibroblasts and breast tumor-derived MDA-MB-231 cells. We first demonstrated that tumor cells activated fibroblasts by releasing an unidentified factor. Activation appeared to involve up-regulation of podoplanin in dermal fibroblasts, which plays a major role in the effects these fibroblasts have on tumor cells. In turn, activated fibroblasts released one or more soluble signals, tentatively identified as matrix metalloproteinases and the cytokine SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12, which accelerated the rate of tumor cell aggregation and aggregate coalescence by four-fold. HPMF activation involved a different gene expression pattern but nevertheless, similar to CC-NHDFs, MMP secretion was markedly increased along with the rate and extent of coalescence in breast cancer cells. We further demonstrated that activated fibroblasts also accelerate aggregation and coalescence by traversing a 3D Matrigel environment and physically acting as scaffolds for cancer cells. We hypothesize that the reciprocal signaling system, in conjunction with the direct interaction of activated fibroblasts with cancer cells, as revealed in the 3D Matrigel environment and described here, may reflect interactions between breast cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts in vivo. These interactions may ultimately facilitate tumor growth and coalescence in early stages of tumorigenesis in field cancerized tissue and may also reflect cancer cell-fibroblast interactions that do not involve coalescence during tumor development.Supporting informationReferencesStromal contributions to the carcinogenic processThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerIonizing radiation-mediated premature senescence and paracrine interactions with cancer cells enhance the expression of syndecan 1 in human breast stromal fibroblasts: the role of TGF-betaSyndecan-1 in breast cancer stroma fibroblasts regulates extracellular matrix fiber organization and carcinoma cell motilityMatrix crosslinking forces tumor progression by enhancing integrin signalingMatrix metalloproteinases as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in human cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsCarcinoma-associated fibroblasts: orchestrating the composition of malignancyFibroblast surface-associated FGF-2 promotes contact-dependent colorectal cancer cell migration and invasion through FGFR-SRC signaling and integrin \u03b1(v)\u03b2(5)-mediated adhesionFibroblast-led collective invasion of carcinoma cells with differing roles for RhoGTPases in leading and following cellsA mechanically active heterotypic E-cadherin/N-cadherin adhesion enables fibroblasts to drive cancer cell invasionReciprocal activation of prostate cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts stimulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stemnessA Computer-Assisted 3D Model for Analyzing the Aggregation of Tumorigenic Cells Reveals Specialized Behaviors and Unique Cell Types that Facilitate Aggregate CoalescenceMelanoma cells undergo aggressive coalescence in a 3D Matrigel model that is repressed by anti-CD44Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 promotes breast cancer metastasis by facilitating tumor cell intravasationThe hallmarks of CAFs in cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts induce metalloprotease-independent cancer cell invasion of the basement membraneCancer associated fibroblasts: An essential role in the tumor microenvironmentField cancerization in oral stratified squamous epithelium;

Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

(A2\u2013E2) Histograms demonstrating the distribution of expression levels of each of the factors in basal and luminal-A patient tumors. RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2). (B) CCL2 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (B1) and IL-1\u03b2 (B2). (C) CCL5 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (C1) and IL-1\u03b2 (C2). RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Pro-metastatic Chemokines Reach Their Highest Expression Levels When TNBC:Stroma \u201cContact\u201d Co-cultures Are Stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2To follow up on the above findings, we asked how the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 regulate TNBC:MSC interactions that may lead to elevated release of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK.

Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells. Studies of endothelial cell (HPMEC) migration in response to CM derived from different cell combinations of MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) (A) and MCF-7 cells (B). (A1, B1) Representative photos of HPMEC migration in response to TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10 ng/ml), from tumor cells alone, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 alone and from tumor cells grown under \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs only. Bars, 50 \u03bcm. (A2, B2) Migrated HPMEC were counted in multiple photos per insert of the experiments presented in A1 and B1. ***p < 0.001, *p < 0.05, ns=non-significant for comparisons between CM of different cell combinations and CM of tumor cells treated by vehicle. Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

Migration assays were performed in response to medium containing 10% FBS, for 12 h. ***p < 0.001, ns=non-significant for differences between migration of tumor cells in different combinations, compared to the migration of non-stimulated TNBC cells. \u2227In panel (A2), this value was significant in 1 out of 3 experiments.

In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

Instead, two representative photos out of many taken in n > 3 independent experiments, are provided for each treatment. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.TNBC-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Lead Through CXCL8 Activities to Increased Angiogenesis, as Well as to Elevated Migration and Invasion of TNBC CellsThe findings demonstrated so far indicated that tumor-stroma-inflammation networks can lead in TNBC to (1) increased production of pro-metastatic chemokines such as CXCL8 and (2) elevated angiogenesis, tumor cell migration and invasion. To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL. Parallel studies indicated that the efficiency of CXCL8 down-regulation was high [80\u201390% in most experiments, as in; Data not shown]. The cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml); then, the cells or their CM were assayed in the following tests: (A) Endothelial cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 8A). ***p < 0.001; (B) Tumor cell morphology (Procedures as in Figure 9A1).

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+.

Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are reportedly involved in invasion and metastasis in several types of cancer, including gastric cancer (GC), through the stimulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. However, the mechanisms underlying these tumor-promoting effects are not well understood, which limits the potential to develop therapeutic targets against CAF-mediated CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling. CXCL12 expression was analyzed in resected GC tissues from 110 patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We established primary cultures of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and CAFs from the GC tissues and examined the functional differences between these primary fibroblasts using co-culture assays with GC cell lines. We evaluated the efficacy of a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) and a FAK inhibitor (PF-573,228) on the invasive ability of GC cells. High CXCL12 expression levels were significantly associated with larger tumor size, increased tumor depth, lymphatic invasion and poor prognosis in GC. CXCL12/CXCR4 activation by CAFs mediated integrin \u03b21 clustering at the cell surface and promoted the invasive ability of GC cells. Notably, AMD3100 was more efficient than PF-573,228 at inhibiting GC cell invasion through the suppression of integrin \u03b21/FAK signaling. These results suggest that CXCL12 derived from CAFs promotes GC cell invasion by enhancing the clustering of integrin \u03b21 in GC cells, resulting in GC progression. Taken together, the inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in GC cells may be a promising therapeutic strategy against GC cell invasion.",

Peter P. Lee and colleagues from the City of Hope in Duarte, California, USA, analyzed protein and gene expression levels in brain metastases, and showed that it is the stromal cells (support cells such as fibroblasts), rather than the cancer cells themselves, that are the source of these homing signals. When compared against stromal cells derived from primary breast tumors or healthy breast tissue, they found that the stromal cells that had lodged themselves in the brain expressed the highest levels of CXCL12 and CXCL16, two chemokines involved in cell movement. Using three-dimensional aggregates, the researchers showed that these metastatic stromal cells promoted cancer cells migration more potently than stromal cells from primary tumors or normal breast tissues. Blocking the chemokine activity or that of its receptor impaired cancer cell movement, suggesting a possible therapeutic strategy for preventing brain metastasis in patients with breast cancer. These results highlight the importance of the tumor microenvironment and stromal cells in the metastasis process of breast cancer.IntroductionBrain metastasis is the most lethal outcome of breast cancer, leading to death within 4\u20136 months in 10\u201315% of patients once detected. For brain metastasis to occur, cancer cells from the primary tumor must migrate to the brain, traverse the blood\u2013brain barrier, and proliferate within the brain parenchyma. Emerging data suggest that outcome of metastasis is influenced by the specific organ microenvironment stromal cells that permit the effective colonization and growth of circulating tumor cells. We hypothesized that mesenchyme-derived fibroblasts, the major cell population of tumor stroma, promote invasion, survival, and proliferation of migrating cancer cells to facilitate breast cancer brain metastasis.Conventional methods to model the metastatic process ex vivo mainly involve two-dimensional (2D) monolayer in vitro systems, which do not recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) in vivo microenvironment. Cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions in 3D spatial environment are critical for understanding the complex cross-talk mechanisms between cancer and stromal cells. For example, both gene and protein expressions in an ex vivo 3D culture system appear to conserve various paracrine-dependent cellular interactions that occur in vivo microenvironment. Furthermore, studies have shown that testing of chemotherapy treatments or immunotherapies based on 2D monolayer systems does not correspond with results in an in vivo setting, further demonstrating the limitations of 2D monolayer systems. Hence, developing and testing the effectiveness of novel therapies for breast cancer in vitro require recreation of the 3D breast cancer microenvironment composed of stroma and cancer cells, ideally derived from the same patient, as one functional unit.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to produce various chemokines to facilitate angiogenesis and cancer cell migration. To investigate the role of CAFs in breast cancer brain metastasis, we isolated and expanded fibroblasts derived from normal breast, primary, and brain metastatic tumor tissues. Utilizing 3-D ex-vivo aggregates composed of different CAFs with cancer cells, we evaluated the expression of various chemokines and growth factors by RNA-Seq, real-time quantitative qPCR, immuno-histochemical staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These studies showed that metastatic CAFs from brain metastases produce high levels of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16, promoting the migration of patient-specific breast cancer cells in a 3-D aggregate system. Moreover, blocking of CXCR4, the chemokine receptor for CXCL12, and neutralization of CXCL16, the ligand for CXCR6 in patient-specific cancer cells significantly prevented the migration of cancer cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME). These novel findings from our 3D CAF aggregate system provide proof of principle that chemokine modulation represents an effective therapeutic strategy to prevent tumor progression and metastasis.ResultsIsolation of breast cancer cells and CAFs from patient tumor tissuesPatient characteristicsNumber of patients\tMedian age of patients\tMean age of patients\t\t\t\t\t \t5\t32\t37\t\t\t\t\t \tSample\tType\tMolecular subtype (ER, PR, Her2)\tTumor grade\tCancer stage\tAge\tBRCA\t \tBC56\tNormal\t\t\t\t48\t(+)\t \tBC78\tNormal\t\t\t\t32\t(+)\t \tBC82\tNormal\t\t\t\t32\t\t \tBC97\tNormal\t\t\t\t47\t\t \tBC 131\tNormal\t\t\t\t25\t(+)\t \tNumber of patients\tMedian age of patients\tMean age of patients\t\t\t\t\t \t8\t58\t55\t\t\t\t\t \tSample\tType\tMolecular subtype (ER, PR, Her2)\tTumor grade\tCancer stage\tAge\t\t \tBC68\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tII\tIA\t64\t\t \tBC80\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tIII\tIIA\t29\t\t \tBC84\tPrimary\t(+), (\u2212), (\u2212)\tIII\t\t72\t\t \tBC 95\tPrimary\t(+), (\u2212), (+)\tIII\tIA\t50\t\t \tBC105\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tIII\tIIA\t71\t\t \tBC108\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tII\tIIA\t39\t\t \tBC153\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tI\tIIIA\t59\t\t \tBC155\tPrimary\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\tII\tIIB\t57\t\t \tNumber of patients\tMedian age of patients\tMean age of patients\t\t\t\t\t \t7\t59\t59\t\t\t\t\t \tSample\tType\tMolecular subtype (ER, PR, Her2)\tTumor grade\tCancer stage\tAge\t\t \tBC25\tBrain Met\t(\u2212), (\u2212), (+)\t\t\t66\t\t \tBC55\tBrain Met\t(\u2212), (\u2212), (+)\t\t\t54\t\t \tBC66\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (+)\t\t\t52\t\t \tBC70\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\t\t\t63\t\t \tBC 122\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (+)\t\t\t59\t\t \tBC137\tBrain Met\t(+), (+), (\u2212)\t\t\t54\t\t \tBC 156\tBrain Met\t(\u2212), (\u2212), (+)\t\t\t62\t\t \tPrimary breast tumor patients are categorized based on molecular subtypes, tumor grade, cancer stage, and age.

As controls, we also obtained six normal breast tissue samples from either the contralateral breast of breast cancer patients, or patients who underwent prophylactic mastectomy. Histological analysis of both human primary breast and brain metastatic tumor samples showed the presence of vimentin-positive stromal cells surrounding cytokeratin-positive breast cancer cells (Fig.\u00a01a). To study these cells and develop an ex-vivo culture system that allows expansion of both patient-specific breast cancer cells and CAFs, human breast tumor tissue was mechanically dissociated into small fragments, and plated onto tissue culture plate in medium supplemented with epidermal and keratinocyte growth factor. Within 2 weeks, both CD326+ CD44\u2212 cancer cells and CD326\u2212 CD44+ CAFs expanded by outgrowth from the initial tumor fragments (Fig.\u00a01b). To investigate whether CD326\u2212 CD44+ adherent fibroblasts express mesenchyme-derived surface markers, we performed immunophenotypic characterization of the monolayer generated in breast tumor fragment cultures after 3 weeks by flow cytometry. Nearly all the ex vivo expanded mesoderm-derived fibroblasts from normal breast, and CAFs from primary and brain metastatic tumors expressed the common mesenchyme markers CD44, CD90, CD105, CD166, and CD140\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a01c). In contrast, CD326+ breast cancer cells did not display the surface markers expressed by CAFs (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01).  Both semi-quantitative and quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF), and Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) (factors known to support growth of cancer cells) were expressed by both primary tumor and brain metastasis CAFs (Fig.\u00a01d and Supplemental Fig.\u00a02). This provides evidence that cultured CAFs produce factors important for maintenance of patient-specific breast cancer cells. Since bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to reside within breast TME and express similar surface markers as CAFs, trans-differentiation assays were performed to determine if some of the CAF populations were capable of undergoing adipogenesis as observed in MSCs. In addition, we further investigated the expression of STRO-1, the surface antigen known to express by bone marrow MSCs. Our data showed that CAFs derived from primary breast tumor and brain metastasis express higher levels of STRO-1, and can differentiate into adipocytes, suggesting our CAF culture contains MSC-like cell populations (Supplemental Fig.\u00a03). Generation of human breast tumor-derived CAF aggregatesGeneration of 3-D human breast cancer microenvironment in vitro. a Schematic representation for generation of 3-D human breast stroma aggregates for in vitro model. Human breast cancer associated breast stromal cells were generated from patient specific primary or brain met tumor tissues ex vivo. Aggregates were then cultured on nucleopore membranes floating in D10 medium supplemented with human epidermal growth factor for 2 weeks for in vitro analyses. b Immuno-histochemical staining comparison between human breast cancer tissues and cancer-associated stromal aggregates. Paraffin-embedded stromal aggregates were sectioned and stained for vimentin, and activated fibroblast markers including alpha smooth muscle and fibroblast activating protein (FAP). Expression of ECM components was analyzed in both tissue section and aggregates. Antibody staining directed against fibronectin and collagen IV showed the presence of ECM in all aggregates. c Immuno-fluorescent antibody staining against Ki67 (red), cytokeratin (yellow) and vimentin (green) in patient-derived aggregates composed of cancer cells mixed with either normal, primary or metastatic stroma. Bar graph illustrates relative expression of Ki67 in cancer cells combined with either normal, primary or metastatic stroma patient samples2-D culture models do not fully replicate complexities in tumor tissues, such as multi-dimensional cellular structure, extracellular matrixes, and divergent gene expression patterns. Hence, we generated 3-D aggregates from cells cultured out of normal breast tissue, primary and metastatic tumors to recapitulate complexities displayed by the human TME. Normal breast fibroblast and patient-specific CAF aggregates were created by centrifugation of monolayers generated from tissue culture, followed by further culturing on nucleo-pore filters (Fig.\u00a02a). In order to demonstrate the ability of 3-D CAF aggregates to produce, and maintain ECM and CAF markers, cell aggregates were cultured and paraffin-sectioned for histological analyses. H&E stains of normal breast and tumor samples showed morphological similarities with their corresponding 3-D CAF aggregates (Supplemental Fig.\u00a04). IHC stains showed that important ECM components, such as Collagen IV and Fibronectin, were preserved in all aggregates as compared to fresh human breast tumor tissues (Fig.\u00a02b). Expression of fibroblastic activating protein (FAP) and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) has been described in myofibroblasts and CAF. As expected, FAP and \u03b1-SMA expressing cells were more prevalent in primary and brain metastasis CAF aggregates when compared to normal fibroblast aggregates (Fig.\u00a02b). To further investigate whether FAP+ \u03b1-SMA+ cells detected from brain metastasis aggregates originated from cell types of the central nervous system (CNS), such as astrocytes and ependymal cells, we examined the expression of glilal fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in brain metastasis aggregates (Supplemental Fig.\u00a05). CAFs from brain metastasis do not express GFAP, suggesting that they are of non-CNS origin. To demonstrate whether our CAF aggregate system can maintain and promote proliferation of cancer cells, we generated CAF aggregates mixed with breast cancer cells and measured Ki-67 expression in cancer cells. Here, we generated patient-derived cancer cells with patient-derived CAF aggregates in order to more fully mimic the natural TME setting. Data shown in Fig.\u00a02c demonstrate that our 3D co-culture system supports proliferation of patient-derived cancer cells. We detected significantly higher numbers of Ki-67-positive cancer cells in primary and metastatic CAF aggregates than from normal breast fibroblasts aggregates (Fig.\u00a02c). Mesenchyme-derived growth factors known to promote cancer cell proliferation (EGF, FGF1, FGF2, and IGF-1) were expressed in different CAF populations to different levels (Fig.\u00a01d and Supplemental Fig.\u00a02). Overall, these results showed that the ex vivo CAF 3-D aggregates system served as a sufficient ECM producing microenvironment and provided growth factors capable of cancer cells proliferation.mRNA level expression and histological analysis of chemokines in primary tumor and brain metastasis-derived human breast CAF 3-D aggregatesGene and protein expression analyses of 3-D human breast cancer CAF aggregates. a Heat map of hierarchical cluster analysis of RNA seq data derived from the normal, primary breast tumor CAF, and brain met CAF aggregates. BC82 and BC97 were used for the normal aggregate group; BC68 and BC80 were used for the primary tumor aggregate group; BC66, BC70 and BC55 were used for the brain metastasis aggregate group (see Table\u00a01). Individual gene dot plots showing changes in mean expression levels of transcripts PDGF\u03b1, CXCL12, and CXCL16. b Quantitative RT-PCR validation of relative changes in expression levels of the CXCL12, CXCL16, and PDGF\u03b1. c Immuno-fluorescent staining directed against CXCL12 and CXCL16 expression from patient tissue and patient-derived CAF aggregate. Representative immuno-fluorescence images show Vimentin (green) and CXCL12/CXCL16 (red) expression in both patient tissues and patient-derived stromal aggregates. Scale bar for zoomed images represent 50\u2009\u00b5m. d Measurement of soluble CXCL16 in media of patient-derived normal, primary and metastatic stroma by ELISA. Metastatic & primary stroma: (#\nP\u2009<\u20090.03)To investigate whether CAF aggregates generated from primary or metastatic breast tumor tissues display different gene expression patterns, RNA samples were extracted from each independent aggregate culture and analyzed via RNA-Seq. The raw FASTQ files obtained from RNA-seq were analyzed via CLC Genomic Workbench to compare gene expression levels between groups. Differences in relative gene expression levels between each CAF aggregate group (normal, primary tumor, and brain metastasis) are shown as a heat map (Fig.\u00a03a) generated through hierarchical clustering. Additionally, a list of the top differentially expressed growth factors and cytokines is shown in Supplemental Table\u00a01. Based on gene transcript expression differences, among the consistently over expressed transcripts in the metastatic aggregates were CXCL16, CXCL12, and platelet-derived growth factor alpha. Amongst these, CXCL16 showed the highest fold change in CAFs from metastatic tumors compared to normal breast or primary tumors (5.34 and 6.436, respectively). While reports have shown that tumors produce high levels of chemokines including CXCL12, these studies did not identify CAFs as the source within the TME. High level secretion of CXCL16 from patient-derived brain metastasis CAFs has not been reported. To further validate differentially expressed transcripts from each group of aggregate, quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Fig.\u00a03b) and IHC were performed on patient tissues and CAF aggregates (Fig.\u00a03c). Relative changes in chemokine genes expression and proteins levels were directly related to the RNA-seq and qRT-PCR data illustrated in Fig.\u00a03a, b. While CXCL16 can exist as either secreted or trans-membrane bound forms, only the soluble form is known to function as a chemotactic ligand for CXCR6-expressing cancer and immune cells. Production of the secreted form of CXCL16 was analyzed via ELISA from each representative CAF population (Fig.\u00a03d). High levels of secreted chemokines observed in the ELISA assay from brain metastatic CAF aggregates provides a mechanism by which breast cancer cells are attracted to the metastatic brain microenvironment.Effects of CAFs in migration of cancer cellsEffects of CAF in migration of cancer cells in vitro. a Immuno-fluorescent images comparing migration of cancer cell line MCF-Her2 (Red) to either normal, primary or metastatic patient-derived CAF aggregate. Bar graph quantifies relative migration of Her-2+ (CD340+) cancer cells to normal (BC69, BC82, BC97, and BC102), primary (BC80, BC95, BC105, and BC108), or metastatic (BC25, BC55, BC66, and BC70) CAF aggregates (see Table\u00a01). b Immunofluorescent images comparing migration of patient-derived cancer cells to either normal, primary or metastatic patient-derived CAF aggregate. Bar graph demonstrates relative migratory count of cancer cells to normal (BC69, BC82, BC97, and BC102), primary (BC80, BC95, BC105, and BC108), or metastatic (BC25, BC55, BC66, and BC70) CAF aggregates. c Immunofluorescence images compare migration of patient-specific cancer cells (green) towards either Primary CAF (Red) or Brain Metastasis CAF (Blue) on Day 0 and Day 4. Bar graph quantifies relative total cell fluorescence of patient-specific cancer cells that have migrated to primary or brain metastatic CAF aggregate. (#\nP\u2009<\u20090.01)Based on our studies indicating that brain metastatic CAF aggregates produced higher levels of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 as compared to normal breast fibroblasts or primary tumor CAF aggregates, we performed cancer cell migration assays (using MCF-HER2 cells or patient-derived cancer cells) to investigate the relative propensity of breast cancer cells to migrate to these different microenvironments. Each aggregate was embedded in hydrogel solution to maintain its overall 3D structure. Figure\u00a04a shows a schematic representation for cancer cell migration in vitro and an example photograph of CAF aggregates in hydrogel with a MCF-HER2 cell line or patient-derived cancer cells embedded in the center. Based on live cell imaging, immunofluorescent microscopy, and FACS analysis, we found that significantly higher numbers of MCF-HER2 cells or patient-derived cancer cells migrated to brain metastatic CAF aggregates than primary CAF or normal breast fibroblasts aggregates (Fig.\u00a04b and Supplemental Fig.\u00a06). To further explore the chemotactic activity of primary or brain metastatic CAF aggregates, we generated PKH-labeled primary (red color) or brain metastatic (blue) CAF aggregates mixed with green color-labeled patient-derived breast cancer cells (1:1 ratio), and positioned these aggregates against a separate CAF aggregate without cancer cells (Fig.\u00a04c). This hydrogel system maintains the architecture of 3-D aggregates, and also allows cancer cell migration and invasion to distant locations. We consistently observed that cancer cells already associated with primary tumor CAFs still migrated out towards brain metastasis CAF aggregates. This migration took a longer period of time than the earlier results observed in Fig.\u00a04a, b, suggesting that cancer cells were still being partially attracted by primary tumor CAFs as they migrated away towards brain metastasis CAFs. These data confirm that brain metastasis CAFs promote migration of breast cancer cells more effectively than normal fibroblasts or primary tumor CAFs.CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody treatments reduce cancer cell recruitmentCombination of CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody treatment reduces cancer cell recruitment. a FACS analysis of relative CXCR4 or CXCR6 expression on cancer cell line MCF HER2 and patient-specific cancer cells derived from brain metastasis or skin metastasis tissue. b Immuno-fluorescent images demonstrate relative migration of patient-specific cancer cells (green) to brain metastasis stroma (red) with or without CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralization in Hydrogel-Migration assay. c: Bar graph quantifies the relative migration of patient specific cancer cells that have been untreated or treated with CXCR4 antagonist, CXCL16 neutralization antibody, or a combination of both agents. An asterisk indicates significant differences between groups of animals (*P\u2009\u2264\u20090.02, **P\u2009\u2264\u20090.045, ***P\u2009\u2264\u20090.02). Each value represents the mean of 3\u20135 independent experiments. For the migration assay, BC25, BC55, BC66, BC70 brain metastatic CAF aggregates were independently utilized (see Table\u00a01). Consistent results were obtained in repeated experiments throughout. The vertical bold lines branching off from the top of the horizontal lines represent statistically significant P values when the untreated, CXCR4 antagonist, and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody groups were individually compared with all other groupsTo further investigate the importance of chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 secreted by metastatic CAFs on breast cancer cell migration, we analyzed the expression of cognate chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CXCR6 on patient-derived cancer cells. FACS analysis showed that patient-derived breast cancer cells expressed both CXCR4 and CXCR6 (Fig.\u00a05a). Utilizing our hydrogel assay system, patient-derived breast cancer cells were treated with a receptor-blocking antagonist directed against CXCR4 alone or in combination with neutralizing antibody directed against CXCL16 and tested for cancer cell migration to brain metastatic CAF aggregates. Unlike CXCR4 in which a small molecule antagonist Plerixafor (Selleckchem) is available, only anti-CXCL16 neutralizing antibody is available for blocking the CXCR6\u2013CXCL16 interaction. Indeed, CXCR4 antagonist treatment significantly reduced the ability of cancer cells to migrate to brain metastatic CAF aggregates, while CXCL16 antibody treatment was less effective than CXCR4 antagonist treatment alone (Fig.\u00a05b, c). Combination of both inhibitors resulted in blocking cancer cell migration most significantly. These data suggest that secretion of CXCL12 and CXCL16 by CAFs plays a critical role in attracting breast cancer cells to the brain metastatic microenvironment. DiscussionMetastasis involves the abnormal capacity of cancer cells to migrate, and aberrant cancer cell mobility is emerging as an important area of investigation. Why breast cancer cells migrate to the brain to cause metastasis remains incompletely understood, and requires further investigation. In this study, we isolated patient-derived CAFs and cancer cells from primary human breast tumors and brain metastases, and developed 3D models to study their interactions. Based on gene and immunohistological analyses, we found that expression levels of chemokines CXCL16 and CXCL12 are significantly higher in CAFs from brain metastasis than those from primary tumors or normal breast tissues. We further demonstrated that brain metastasis CAF 3D aggregates attract patient-derived breast cancer cells much more effectively than primary tumor CAF or normal fibroblast aggregates in a hydrogel assay system. Blocking CXCR4 and/or CXCL16 neutralization, alone or in combination, resulted in significant inhibition of patient-derived cancer cells migration to brain metastatic CAF aggregates, further supporting the importance of CXCL16 and CXCL12 in migration of CTCs into brain-associated microenvironment.CAFs have been shown to promote the growth of cancer cells via secreting various growth factors (EGF, Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), FGF, Tranforming Growth Factor-alpha (TGF-\u03b1), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) etc), and to induce invasion and metastasis of cancer cells by production of CXCL12, MMP, and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21). CXCL12 has been shown to play an important role in the attraction of CTCs towards future sites of metastasis, and CXCR4 (receptor for CXCL12) antagonism has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and decrease metastatic burden. CXCL16/CXCR6 interaction has also been shown to promote migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cell lines, and recent studies published by Xiao et al. have shown that this axis can induce invasiveness based on the activation of the ERK1/2 and F-actin pathways. While these previous studies explored the role of these chemokine axes within cell lines and the primary TME, none of these prior investigations examined or identified the source of the chemokines within the metastatic TME. Our findings confirm the clinical significance of CXCL12 and CXCL16 in the formation of brain metastatic niche, and point to CAFs as the primary source for these chemokines.In summary, this is the first report demonstrating the expression of both CXCL16 and CXCL12 in CAFs derived from human breast cancer metastasis in the brain. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody directed against CXCL16, alone or in combination with CXCR4 antagonist, significantly inhibited the migration of patient-derived breast cancer cells in our 3D CAF aggregate system. The unique expression of CXCL16 by brain metastasis CAFs provides an important area of cancer research that will further our understanding of metastatic progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding the specific role of CAFs on metastatic progression, and possible strategies to target chemokine interactions to prevent the migration of circulating breast cancer cells to the brain.Materials and methodsCulturing patient-derived cancer cells and fibroblastsNormal breast, primary, and brain metastatic tumor tissues were obtained from patients treated at City of Hope according to guidelines approved by the City of Hope Institutional Review Board. Tissues were mechanically dissociated into small fragments (\u22641\u2009mm diameter), and cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates (Fischer Scientific) with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) media (D10) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For the generation of human breast CAFs, breast tumor fragments were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (D10 medium), penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and L\u2010glutamine (Invitrogen). To promote adherence of tumor fragments, tissue culture plates were coated with 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). CAF cultures can be passaged for up to 4 weeks, and can be frozen for later use while maintaining their mesenchyme-derived surface markers consistenly. However, to maintain similar CAF characteristics in culture, isolated CAFs were passaged no more than four times for these experiments. Breast cancer cells were cultured in calcium-free DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS, cholera toxin (10\u2009ng/mL), bovine insulin (60\u2009ug/mL), hydrocortisone (0.5\u2009ug/mL), epidermal growth factor (20\u2009ng/mL), penicillin/stremptomycin, and L-Glutamine.Generation of patient-derived 3D aggregateTo generate normal, primary and metastatic patient-derived 3D aggregates, cancer or stromal cells were centrifuged at 1300\u2009RPM for 5\u2009min into pellets in 1.5\u2009mL microcentrifuge tubes. After removal of the supernatant, aggregates were retrieved using micropipette tips (approximately 10\u2009ul), and expelled onto nucleopore filter membrane (0.8\u2009\u00b5m pore size; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) floating on gel foam inserts (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) supplemented with D10 medium. Following 2\u20134 weeks, patient-derived aggregates were harvested in culture, and utilized for downstream experimentation, and analysis in both the hydrogel migration assay and immunohistochemistry.Chromogenic immunohistochemistryThe composition of the extracellular matrix and collagen architecture was examined by chromogenic immunohistochemistry. Three-micrometer paraffin embedded sections of tissues or aggregates were deparaffinized in xylene, and subsequently rehydrated in descending concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed utilizing a 1\u00d7 DIVA citrate buffer (pH\u2009=\u20096.0) in a Biocare Decloaker (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) for 30\u2009s at 125\u2009\u00b0C, then 3.5\u2009min at 90\u2009\u00b0C. The following primary antibodies were incubated on the tissue or aggregate sections for 1\u2009h: \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (mouse monoclonal clone 1A4) and vimentin (mouse monoclonal clone V9), both from Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA; Collagen IV (Mouse monoclonal Col94), Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA, USA, Fibronectin (mouse monoclonal sc-271098), Santa Cruz biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); and FAP (Rabbit polyclonal clone AB2), Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA. Based upon the species of each primary antibody, the following secondary antibodies were incubated on the tissue or aggregate of interest for 20\u2009min: MACH 2 Mouse HRP-polymer (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA) or MACH 2 Rabbit HRP-polymer. Following incubation and a rinse in Tris-Buffered Saline solution buffer, the DAB Chromogen Kit from Biocare Medical was used to illustrate the marker of interest.Fluorescent immunohistochemistryPatient-derived aggregates and tissue sections were paraffin embedded, and de-paraffinized in Xylene. Anti-Cytokeratin (mouse monoconal), and Vimentin (mouse monoclonal clone V9) antibodies were purchased from Dako (Carpinteria, CA, USA), anti-Ki67 (rabbit monoclonal) antibody was purchased from Biocare (Concord, CA, USA). The fluorophores Cy3, FITC, and Alexa 647 conjugates were used at a concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcg/mL (Biocare). Imaging was performed through the Zeiss Axio Observer. The chemokine composition of the patient-derived aggregate was identified by using primary antibodies on the tissue or aggregate of interest for 1\u2009h: Vimentin (mouse monoclonal clone V9), SDF-1 (rabbit monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and the CXCL16 (rabbit monoclonal; abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).Histological and immunofluorescent microscopyImaging of the 3\u2009\u03bcm formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues and aggregates were performed using an Olympus BX51WI fixed-stage upright microscope equipped with the Vectra platform (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Immunofluorescent imaging of the hydrogel assay was performed utilizing a Zeiss Axiovert 200\u2009M-wide field fluorescence microscope equipped with the RTE CCD 1300-XHS camera.Fluorescent cell membrane labelingTo elucidate and differentiate both the cancer and stromal cells migrating within the hydrogel, PKH26 Red Fluorescent membrane stain (Sigma Aldrich) was used to stain stromal cells, and PKH67 Green Fluorescent membrane stain (Sigma Aldrich) was utilized to stain cancer cells. Both stromal and cancer cells numbering 1.0\u20132.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106\u2009cells/mL were re-suspended in 1\u00d7 PBS. One-micromolar of either PKH67 green dye or PKH26 red dye was mixed with 500\u2009\u03bcl of Diluent C to a single cell suspension in a 2\u2009mL centrifuge tube in which 0.5\u2009\u03bcM PKH26/67 final dye concentration was used. The cells were then incubated in the dark for 5\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Subsequent washing of the cells in 800\u2009\u03bcL of FBS quenched the staining reaction, and cell mixtures were pelleted via centrifugation at 1000\u2009RPM for 10\u2009min. Brain metastasis stromal cells were labeled blue with Wheat Germ Agglutinin, Alexa Fluor\u00ae 350 Conjugated from Invitrogen. The cells were incubated for 10\u2009min at 37\u2009\u00b0C at a starting concentration of 5.0\u2009\u03bcg/mL, then washed twice in HBSS buffer. Following two washes in HBSS buffer, cells are pelleted, and placed onto the Millipore membrane filter /Foam system that served as the vehicle for the cells to form 3D aggregates.Hydrogel migration assayThe HyStem hydrogel kit (ESI-Bio) was utilized to create the proper scaffold for migration assays. Hydrogel is a hyaluronan-based gel that effectively crosslinks thio-reactive poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, and was formulated according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions consisting of three components: thiol-modified hyaluronan (Glycosil\u00ae), Thiol-reactive PEGDA crosslinker (Extralink\u00ae), and thiol-modified collagen (Gelin-S\u00ae). Glycosil and Gelin were separately dissolved in 1.0\u2009mL of deionized water, and allowed to dissolve for 1\u2009h. The cross-link agent Extralink\u00ae was then dissolved with 0.5\u2009mL of deionized water. Following the solvation of Glycosil and Gelin-S, the compounds were mixed in a 1:1 ratio. To form the hydrogel, Extralink was added to the Glycosil\u2009+\u2009Gelin-S mixed in a 1:4 volume ratio. The heterogeneous mixture of Gelin-S, Glycosil, and Extralink were then added in 60\u2009uL aliquots to a 35\u2009mm tissue culture dish. Once the gel became opaque in appearance, D10 medium was added onto the gel and surrounding area. The dish was then placed in a humidified 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator with O2 and 10% CO2. The relative migration of PKH green-labeled cancer cells was measured to normal, primary, or metastatic patient aggregates that were labeled with PKH red. Furthermore, a heterogeneous aggregate composed of cancer cells combined with either brain metastatic stroma or primary stroma was created. The relative migration of cancer cells within the aggregate system was measured through both fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry.CXCR4 antagonist and CXCL16 neutralization hydrogel migration assayCXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor (Selleckchem) and CXCL16 neutralizing antibody were prepared in a 1\u00d7 PBS (Dulbeccos\u2019s) at a stock concentration of 500\u2009mM. Cell lines or patient-specific cells were washed in 1\u00d7 PBS and re-suspended in 500\u2009\u00b5L of 1\u00d7 PBS supplemented with 100\u2009mM of Plerixafor and/or 0.25\u2009\u00b5g of anti-CXCL16 (purchased from Selleckchem and R & D Systems). The cancer cell-antagonist mixture was then incubated for 2\u2009h in a humidified incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C with O2 and 10% CO2. The antagonized cells were then pelleted at 1200\u2009RPM for 5\u2009min, and utilized for downstream hydrogel-migration assays.RNA-seq library preparation and data analysisPatient-derived aggregates were mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, subsequently the aggregates\u2019 RNA was purified using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The purified RNA libraries were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 at the City of Hope Integrative Genomics Core. The RNA-seq sequence reads were aligned with Human genome (hg19) using open source RNA-seq alignment tool Tophat (v2.0.8b). The alignment results were converted to RNA-seq gene expression measurement as RPKM (reads/kilo base of total exon length/million mapped) using CLC Genomic Workbench, and normalized to gene models in the NCBI Ref Seq database. Maximum expression <0.05\u2009RPKM was used to filter and exclude very low expressing genes. An EDGE test was then utilized to compare the gene expression between sample groups. The EDGE method was developed specifically for two-group comparisons in situations where many features are studied simultaneously but only a few biological replicates are available for each of the experimental groups (i.e., RNA-seq). Following the EDGE test, significantly differentially expressed genes characterized as cytokines or growth factors were selected (Supplemental Table\u00a01).Growth factor expression in stroma by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCRRNA was extracted from single cell suspensions utilizing an RNEasy RNA isolation kit from Qiagen. cDNA was prepared with a cDNA Super Script III RT kit (Thermo Scientific). For semi-quantitative PCR assays, Promega Master Mix was used to amplify growth factor genes. Cycling conditions consisted of a denaturation step for 5\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of denaturation (95\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min), annealing (72\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s) and extension (72\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009min), with final elongation cycle of 10\u2009min at 72\u2009\u00b0C. Quantitative PCR was performed with BioRad CFX96 and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).The following primers for amplification for RT-qPCR of growth factors were:FGF1 forward: 5\u2032-CACATTCAGCTGCAGCTCAG-3\u2032FGF1 reverse: 5\u2032-TGCTTTCTGGCCATAGTGAGTC-3\u2032FGF2 forward: 5\u2032-CTTCTTCCTGCGCATCCACC-3\u2032FGF2 reverse: 5\u2032-CACATACCAACTGGTGTATTTC-3\u2032EGF forward: 5\u2032-TGGATGTGCTTGATAAGCGG-3\u2032EGF reverse: 5\u2032ACCATGTCCTTTCCAGTGTGT-3\u2032IGF-1 forward: 5\u2032-TGGATGCTCTTCAGTTCGTG-3\u2032IGF-1 reverse: 5\u2032-TGGTAGATGGGGGCTGATAC-3\u2032CXCL12 forward: 5\u2032-GGGCTCCTGGGTTTTGTATT-3\u2032CXCL12 reverse: 5\u2032-GTCCTGAGAGTCCTTTTGCG-3\u2032CXCL16 forward: 5\u2032-GGCCCACCAGAA GCATTTAC-3\u2032CXCL16 reverse: 5\u2032-CTGAAGATGCCCCCTCTGAG-3\u2032Human CXCL16 ELISAPatient-derived stromal cells were cultured on 6-well tissue culture plates. 1\u2009mL of media was collected from each well, and stored at \u221220\u2009\u00b0C.

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

Despite many improvements gained in early detection and treatment of BC, the advanced disease still remains a main challenge. Metabolic traits that are usually linked with type 2 diabetes (T2D), including hyperinsulinemia, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, inflammation, oxidative stress and obesity, are well-known risk factors for BC and major contributors to its progression and metastatic dissemination. For instance, high plasma levels of insulin are associated with increased BC incidence and relapse, resistance to conventional and targeted therapies as well as poor outcome even in the absence of diabetes. Insulin regulates multiple signaling pathways implicated in the growth and metastatic features of BC by binding to and activating either the cognate receptor (IR) or the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). In this regard, it should be mentioned that approximately 80% of BCs express high levels of IR and its autophosphorylation is associated with high BC mortality. In particular, the isoform A of IR (IR-A) is frequently overexpressed in BC, where it regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem-like cell phenotype, cell invasion, metastasis and resistance to therapies. Epidemiological and retrospective clinical data have demonstrated that a first-line drug for T2D, namely metformin, is associated with a low risk of BC and reduced cancer-related mortality rate in T2D patients. Accordingly, extensive preclinical studies have indicated that metformin may exert antitumor effects in BC cells through both direct (insulin-independent) and indirect (insulin-dependent) mechanisms. One of the well-accepted insulin-independent effects of metformin involves the activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn downregulates main insulin-stimulated transduction pathways, such as IRS1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR transduction signaling. Furthermore, it has been reported that IR expression status, which is frequently related to insulin levels, may represent a predictive factor of the antitumoral activity of metformin.Here, we provide evidence regarding novel mechanisms by which metformin may elicit anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects in a naturally immortalized BC cell line named BCAHC\u20101. In particular, we show that the anti-cancer action triggered by metformin relies on its ability to inhibit the insulin/IR-mediated transduction pathway as well as the insulin-generated feedforward loop that couples CXCL12 induction by CAFs to CXCR4 expression by BCAHC\u20101 cells.MethodsReagentsInsulin and Metformin were purchased from Merck Life Science (Milan, Italy). The MEK inhibitor trametinib, the insulin receptor inhibitor OSI-906 and the PI3K\u03b1 inhibitor alpelisib were obtained from MedChemExpress (DBA, Milan, Italy). The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA, Milan, Italy). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except insulin, metformin and AMD3100 that were solubilized in water.Cell culturesBCAHC-1 cells were isolated and characterized as previously described, and maintained in DMEM/F-12 with phenol red, supplemented with 5% FBS and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 and switched to a medium without serum and phenol red the day before treatments to be processed for experiments. CAFs were obtained as previously described from 10 invasive ductal breast carcinomas and pooled for the subsequent studies. Briefly, specimens were cut into 1\u20132\u00a0mm diameter pieces, placed in a digestion solution comprising 400\u00a0IU collagenase, 100\u00a0IU hyaluronidase, 10% serum, antibiotics, and antimycotics, and incubated overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 90\u00d7g for 2\u00a0min, the supernatant containing fibroblasts was centrifuged at 485\u00d7g for 8\u00a0min; the pellet obtained was suspended in Medium 199 and Ham\u2019s F12 mixed 1:1 (supplemented with 10% FBS and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin). CAFs were then expanded into 10-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for three population doublings within a total of 7 to tissue dissociation. Primary cell cultures of fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) (data not shown). FAP\u03b1 antibody (H-56, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) was used to characterize activated fibroblasts (data not shown). We used CAFs passaged for up to 10 population doublings for the experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture.Gene expression studies and PCR arraysTotal RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described. The expression of selected genes was quantified by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and are as follows: 5\u2032-CGAGCCCTTTGATGACTTCCT-3\u2032 (c-Fos forward) and 5\u2032-GGAGCGGGCTGTCTCAGA-3\u2032 (c-Fos reverse); 5\u2032-AGCTGTGCATCTACACCGAC-3\u2032 (cyclin D1 forward) and 5\u2032-GAAATCGTGCGGGGTCATTG-3\u2032 (cyclin D1 reverse); 5\u2032-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA-3\u2032 (ACTB forward) and 5\u2032-CACCTCCCCTGTGTGGACTT-3\u2032 (ACTB reverse); 5\u2032-CCTTGGAGCCAAATTTAAAACCT-3\u2032 (CXCR4 forward) and 5\u2032-GCTGGACCCTCTGCTCACA-3\u2032 (CXCR4 reverse); 5\u2032-CAGATGCCCATGCCGATTCT-3\u2032 (CXCL12 forward) and 5\u2032-TTCTTCAGCCGGGCTACAAT-3\u2032 (CXCL12 reverse). Assays were performed in triplicate and the results were normalized for actin beta (ACTB) expression and then calculated as fold induction of RNA expression.PCR arrays were performed using a TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplification reaction and the results analysis were carried out using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy).Reporter gene assaysFor reporter gene assays, cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500\u00a0mL/well culture medium containing 5% FBS and transfected for 18\u00a0h using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent, as recommended by the manufacture (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy). A mixture containing 0.5\u00a0mg of gene reporter (Fos-luc, kindly obtained from Dr. K. Nose, Department of Microbiology, Showa University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hatanodai, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan; Cyclin D1-luc, kindly obtained from Dr. R. G. Pestell, Kimmel Cancer Center, Department of Cancer Biology and Jefferson Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), and 5\u00a0ng of pRL-TK was then transfected, after 18\u00a0h cells were treated with insulin in the presence or absence of metformin, OSI-906, trametinib and alpelisib for additional 12\u00a0h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the internal transfection control provided by the Renilla luciferase activity. Normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle (\u2212) were set as onefold induction, upon which the activity induced by treatments was calculated. For gene silencing experiments, cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes and transfected by X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent for 24\u00a0h before treatments with a control vector and the plasmid DN/c-Fos (kindly obtained from Dr. C. Vinson, NIH, Bethesda, USA) encoding a c-Fos mutant that heterodimerizes with c-Fos dimerization partners but not allowing DNA binding.Western blot analysisCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments and then lysed in 500\u00a0\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (1.7\u00a0mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u00a0mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u00a0mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u00a0mmol/l sodium orthovanadate and 100\u00a0mmol/l sodium fluoride). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u00a0rpm for 10\u00a0min and protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). Equal amounts of whole-protein extract were resolved on 8\u201310% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy), which were probed with primary antibodies against: phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E4), ERK2 (C-14), AKT, c-Fos (E-8), CXCR4 (4G10), Insulin R\u03b1 (N-20) and \u03b2-actin (AC-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy), cyclin D1 (TA801655) (OriGene Technologies, DBA, Milan, Italy), p-IR (Y1146), p-AKT (D9E) and CXCL12 (3740) (Cell Signaling Technology, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). Proteins were detected by horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) and then revealed using the chemiluminescent substrate for western blotting Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).Acetone precipitation of proteinsProtein precipitation from conditioned medium derived from CAFs was carried out using the precipitation method with acetone. Briefly, four volumes of ice-cold acetone (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy) were added to one volume of sample. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at \u2212\u200920\u00a0\u00b0C overnight. This was followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7g for 15\u00a0min at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Afterwards, the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was air dried, then it was dissolved in 2\u00d7 Laemmli buffer and used in the appropriate experiments. In western blot analysis, the protein loading of conditioned medium samples was checked by Ponceau red staining [0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid] of the blotted membranes.Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on a cover slip, exposed to treatments and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with PBS and incubated at 4\u00a0\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies anti-CXCL12 (3740) (Cell Signaling Technology, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS, probed with Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy) for 1\u00a0h at room temperature. Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:1000) for 3\u00a0min and, after washing, immunofluorescence images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Phalloidin stainingCells were exposed to treatments, washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10\u00a0min, washed briefly with PBS and then incubated with Phalloidin-Fluorescent Conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). The images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Cell cycle analysisTo analyze cell cycle distribution, BCAHC-1 cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105) were cultured in regular medium in 6 well plates and shifted in medium without serum. Next, BCAHC-1 cells were exposed to treatments, then pelleted, once washed with PBS and fixed in 50% methanol overnight at \u2212\u200920\u00a0\u00b0C, before to stain with a solution containing 50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml propidium iodide (PI) in 1\u00d7PBS, 20\u00a0U/ml RNAse-A and 0.1% Triton (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy). Cell phases were estimated as a percentage of a total of 10\u2009000 events. Samples were then analyzed with CytoFLEX flow cytometry (Beckman-Coulter, Milan, Italy).Proliferation assayBCAHC-1 cells (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were seeded in 24-well plates in regular growth medium, washed once they had attached, incubated in medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS and then exposed to treatments. Treatments were renewed every day. The proliferation rate was calculated counting the cells on day 5 using the Countess Automated Cell Counter, as recommended by the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy).Colony formation assayBCAHC-1 cells were cultured in regular growth medium to 90% confluence. Cells were then trypsinized, counted and seeded (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103) in 6-well plates in medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS and then exposed to treatments, as indicated. Treatments were renewed every 3\u00a0days. After 10\u00a0days, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1) for 3\u00a0min at room temperature and then stained with Giemsa (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy) for 10\u00a0min. A total of 10 pictures for each condition was detected using a digital camera and colony number was measured by ImageJ program.Spheroid formation assayFor spheroid generation, 100\u00a0\u03bcl/well of BCAHC-1 cell suspensions (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were placed into 2% agar coated 24-well plates in medium containing 2.5% charcoal stripped FBS. Three days after seeding, tumor spheroids (a single spheroid per well) were exposed to treatments and a 50% medium and treatment renewal was performed every 2\u00a0days. Images were obtained on day 20 using a conventional inverted microscope, thereafter cell number per spheroid was determined by trypsinizing three different spheroids, mixing the cell suspension with trypan blue and counting the number of viable cells. The total number of cells obtained was divided by the number of trypsinized spheroids.Conditioned mediumCAFs were placed in medium without serum and treated with vehicle (\u2212) or 10\u00a0nM insulin for 4\u00a0h. Thereafter, CAFs were washed and fresh medium was added without serum for additional 8\u00a0h. The supernatants were then collected, centrifuged at 3500\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in the appropriate experiments.Migration assayTranswell 8\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate membranes (Costar, Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy) were used to evaluate in vitro cell migration. In 300\u00a0\u03bcl serum free medium, BCAHC-1 cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) previously exposed to treatments were seeded in the upper chamber. Conditioned medium of CAFs was added to the bottom chambers. 8\u00a0h after seeding, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were then removed by wiping with Q-tip, and migrated cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with Giemsa (Merck Life Science, Milan, Italy), photographed using a digital camera and counted using the WCIF ImageJ software.Matrigel evasion assayThe Matrigel drop assay was performed as previously described and modified by suspending 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104/drop of BCAHC-1 cells, previously exposed to treatments, in 15\u00a0\u03bcl of complete medium and gently mixed with 15\u00a0\u03bcl of Corning\u00ae Matrigel\u00ae Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix (Biogenerica, Catania, Italy). The cell/matrigel suspension was layered onto the surface of 12-well plate to form a well-defined drop and placed at 37\u00a0\u00b0C to solidify. 2\u00a0ml of conditioned media collected from CAFs previously treated with vehicle (\u2212) or 10\u00a0nM insulin were placed over the drop. Cells were observed at specified time points and drops were photographed using the ImageFocus Plus V2 software of the inverted Oxion Inverso microscope (Euromex Microscopen bv, The Netherlands). The number of cells migrated out of the drop was measured.TCGA database and data collectionBioinformatics studies were performed using the Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort data of the publicly available dataset The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The patient clinical information, gene expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) and the pathway activity (z-scores) were retrieved from UCSC Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/) on the 7th March 2022. Samples (n. 1247) were filtered for missing values.Survival analysisThe survival analyses were performed using the IR-mediated signaling pathway activity and the IR and CXCR4 gene expression data of the TCGA patients along with the overall survival (OS), and disease-free interval (DFI) information. The survivALL package was employed to examine Cox proportional hazards for all possible points of separation (low\u2013high cut-points). The cut-point with the lowest p-value was selected, therefore dividing the patients with high (n\u2009=\u2009488) and low (n\u2009=\u200987) IR-mediated signaling pathway activity, high (n\u2009=\u2009166) and low (n\u2009=\u200990) IR expression or high (n\u2009=\u2009145) and low (n\u2009=\u2009107) CXCR4 expression. The Kaplan Meier survival curves were generated using the R survival and survminer packages.Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by NewmanKeuls\u2019 test to determine differences in means. Densitometric analysis was performed using the freeware software ImageJ that allowed to quantify the band intensity of the protein of interest with respect to the band intensity of the loading control. All bioinformatics analyses were carried out using R Studio. Box plots were performed with the tidyverse package and the related statistical analysis was carried out by using the t-test. Heatmaps were drawn on the log2 fold changes of gene expression using the pheatmap package. p\u2010values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsMetformin prevents the growth effects triggered by insulin/IR signaling in BCAHC-1 cellsAssessment of IR signaling.

Therefore, we began our study analyzing the expression and activity of IR in the TCGA cohort of ER-positive and negative BC patients. First, we ascertained that the IR mRNA expression as well as the IR-mediated signaling pathway are significantly higher in ER-positive than ER-negative BCs (Fig.\u00a01A, B). In addition, stratifying the BC patients on the basis of the PAM50 gene signature, both IR expression and signaling were found higher in the BC luminal A and luminal B patients respect to the other BC subtypes (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A, B). In accordance with these data, was found enriched and associated with a worse overall survival (OS) (Fig.\u00a01C) in ER-positive respect to ER-negative BC patients. Pre\u2011clinical and currently ongoing clinical trials indicate that the insulin-sensitizer metformin elicits anti-tumor effects in ER-positive BCs and is associated with a lower risk of developing BC in patients with T2D respect to control patients. Hence, we aimed to ascertain whether metformin may inhibit insulin-dependent signaling pathways like phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). To this end, we used as a model system a BC cell line namely BCAHC-1, which is characterized by the peculiar expression of IR and the 46\u00a0kDa ER\u03b1 splice variant (ER\u03b146). First, the insulin-induced IR phosphorylation was prevented using the IR inhibitor OSI-906, but not in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Fig.\u00a01D). The activation of AKT upon insulin exposure was totally abrogated by OSI-906 and alpelisib, but only partially dampened by trametinib (Fig.\u00a01E) as previously reported, whereas the insulin-promoted activation of the ERK1/2 pathway was inhibited by OSI-906 and trametinib but not using alpelisib (Fig.\u00a01F). Next, we assessed that metformin reduces the IR phosphorylation prompted by insulin, without any change in total IR protein expression (Fig.\u00a01G). Moreover, we determined that metformin prevents the activation of both AKT and ERK1/2 upon insulin exposure in BCAHC-1 cells (Fig.\u00a01H, I). On the basis of these findings and in line with previous studies showing that PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 transduction pathways mediate the expression of insulin target genes, such as c\u2010Fos and Cyclin D1, we found that insulin induces c-Fos expression in BCAHC-1 cells at both mRNA (data not shown) and protein levels (Fig.\u00a02A\u2013C). Worthy, OSI-906, alpelisib, trametinib and metformin abrogated either the protein increase (Fig.\u00a02A\u2013C) or the activation of a promoter construct of c-Fos transiently transfected in BCAHC-1 cells (Fig.\u00a02B\u2013D). Similarly, we established that OSI-906, alpelisib and trametinib prevent the Cyclin D1 protein increase and the transactivation of a Cyclin D1 promoter construct upon insulin exposure (Fig.\u00a02E, F). Reminiscing our previous findings showing that c-Fos is involved in the regulation of Cyclin D1, we demonstrated that the protein induction of Cyclin D1 by insulin is prevented transfecting BCAHC-1 cells with a DN/c-Fos expression vector (Fig.\u00a02G). Furthermore, we showed that metformin abolishes the Cyclin D1 protein increase (Fig.\u00a02H) and the activation of a Cyclin D1 promoter construct (Fig.\u00a02I) triggered by insulin. Taken together, these findings indicate that in BCAHC-1 cells metformin inhibits the insulin-induced IR/PI3K/MAPK/c-Fos transduction pathway, thus preventing the up-regulation of Cyclin D1. In line with the acknowledged role of Cyclin D1 as a regulator of G1/S transition in the cell cycle, we found that metformin leads to the arrest within the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in BCAHC-1 cells (Fig.\u00a03A, B). Interestingly, the results of flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide (PI)-staining showed that insulin induces S-phase entry in BCAHC-1 cells, however this effect is no longer evident in the presence of metformin (Fig.\u00a03A, B) and using OSI-906, alpelisib or trametinib (data not shown). In accordance with these observations, the proliferation and colony-forming ability of BCAHC-1 cells upon insulin treatment were abolished by metformin (Fig.\u00a03C\u2013E) as well as in the presence of OSI-906, alpelisib, trametinib (Additional file 2: Fig. S2A\u2013C). In addition, the spheroid expansion of BCAHC-1 cells prompted by insulin was inhibited by metformin (Fig.\u00a03F, G) as well as OSI-906, alpelisib and trametinib (Additional file 2: Fig. S2D, E). Overall, these data indicate that metformin impairs the growth responses induced by insulin in BCAHC-1 cells.Metformin inhibits the up-regulation of the pro-tumorigenic chemokine receptor CXCR4 triggered by insulin in BCAHC-1 cellsCXCR4 is associated with poor outcome in ER-positive BC and stimulated by insulin.

B Kaplan\u2013Meier plot showing the correlation between insulin receptor (IR) expression and disease-free interval (DFI) in ER-positive BC patients exhibiting CXCR4 levels above the median value. C Kaplan\u2013Meier plot showing the correlation of CXCR4 expression with DFI in ER-positive BC patients exhibiting IR levels above the median value. mRNA (D) and protein (E) levels of CXCR4 evaluated respectively by real-time PCR and immunoblotting in BCAHC-1 cells exposed to vehicle (\u2212) or 10\u00a0nM insulin (Ins), as indicated.

F Protein levels of CXCR4 in BCAHC-1 cells exposed for 8\u00a0h to vehicle or 10\u00a0nM Ins alone or in combination with 1\u00a0\u00b5M IR inhibitor OSI-906. G Immunoblot of CXCR4 from BCAHC-1 cells treated for 8\u00a0h with vehicle or 10\u00a0nM Ins alone or in combination with 2\u00a0mM metformin (Met), which was added to culture medium 18\u00a0h before the treatment with vehicle or insulin. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to the loading control. Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. (*) indicates significant differences with respect to vehicle sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05); (black square) indicates significant differences with respect to Insulin treated sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05)Considering that a negative correlation between metformin and the metastatic spread of BC has been reported, we then assessed whether metformin may abolish the capability of insulin to induce a metastatic gene signature in BCAHC-1 cells. In this vein, we performed a TaqMan Gene Expression Assay consisting of a Human Tumor Metastasis Array in BCAHC-1 cells exposed to insulin in the presence or absence of metformin. Among the genes that showed at least a 0.25 log2 fold change upon insulin treatment respect to vehicle and the reduction of this increase in the presence of metformin, we focused on the C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (CXCR4) due to its acknowledged role as prognostic marker and main driver of BC metastasis. Evaluating the expression of CXCR4 in ER-positive BC samples of the TCGA dataset, we assessed by pairwise comparison that CXCR4 levels are significantly higher in ER-positive BCs respect to matched normal tissues (Fig.\u00a04A). Thereafter, we ascertained whether the mRNA expression of both CXCR4 and IR would be predictive of the outcome of ER-positive BC patients. In this regard, survival analyses revealed that high IR levels are associated with a short disease-free interval (DFI) in BC patients showing increased CXCR4 expression (Fig.\u00a04B). Similarly, a correlation between high CXCR4 levels and poor prognosis characterizes BCs displaying enhanced IR levels (Fig.\u00a04C). Considering that insulin modulates pro-metastatic mediators involved in the regulation of CXCR4 in BC cells, we ascertained that insulin increases both mRNA (Fig.\u00a04D) and protein levels (Fig.\u00a04E) of CXCR4 in BCAHC-1 cells. Next, immunoblot experiments showed that either the IR inhibitor OSI-906 (Fig.\u00a04F) or metformin (Fig.\u00a04G) prevent the up-regulation of CXCR4 triggered by insulin, suggesting that metformin prevents the expression of CXCR4 mediated by insulin/IR axis in BCAHC-1 cells.Insulin induces the secretion of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)Insulin triggers CXCL12 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). mRNA (A) and protein (B) expression of CXCL12 evaluated respectively by real-time PCR and immunoblotting in CAFs exposed to vehicle (\u2212) or 10\u00a0nM insulin (Ins), as indicated. In RNA experiments, values were normalized to actin beta (ACTB) expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression upon treatments respect to vehicle. C CXCL12 expression evaluated by immunofluorescence assays in CAFs treated with vehicle or 10\u00a0nM insulin for 8\u00a0h. Nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue signal). Fluorescence intensities were quantified in 10 random fields for each condition and results are expressed as fold change of relative fluorescence units (RFU) over cells treated with vehicle (set as one-fold change). Scale bar: 25\u00a0\u03bcm. D Assessment of CXCL12 protein levels in conditioned medium (CM) collected from CAFs treated for 8\u00a0h with vehicle (\u2212) and 10\u00a0nM Ins. Ponceau red staining was used as a loading control for CM. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to the respective loading control. Results shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. (*) indicates significant differences with respect to vehicle (\u2212) sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05)A crosstalk between tumor cells and cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs) may fuel the growth and metastasis of BC. In particular, the CAF-secreted CXCR4 ligand, namely CXCL12 (also known as SDF-1), is an important factor linking stromal and BC cells toward aggressive malignant features. On the basis of the aforementioned findings and considering that insulin has been implicated in the release of pro-tumorigenic and inflammatory mediators by stromal cells, we ascertained whether insulin may promote the expression and secretion of CXCL12 in breast CAFs. By real-time PCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence experiments we demonstrated that the expression of CXCL12 increases at both mRNA (Fig.\u00a05A) and protein levels (Fig.\u00a05B, C) in CAFs exposed to insulin. Moreover, CXCL12 was found up-regulated in conditioned medium (CM) of CAFs treated with insulin (Fig.\u00a05D), as ascertained by acetone precipitation assays. Altogether, these data suggest that insulin induces the increase of the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 and stimulates its release by CAFs.Metformin suppresses the insulin-driven feedforward loop linking CXCR4 induction in BCAHC-1 cells to CXCL12 expression and secretion by CAFsInsulin-stimulated CXCL12/CXCR4 axis promotes the cytoskeleton reorganization and migration in BCAHC-1 cells.

Cells were then cultured for additional 3\u00a0days to conditioned medium (CM) collected from CAFs, which were previously treated for 8\u00a0h with vehicle or 10\u00a0nM insulin, as indicated. Arrows point to the matrigel drop border. B Percentage of cells around the drop upon 3\u00a0days treatment from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Scale bar: 500\u00a0\u03bcm. (*) indicates significant differences with respect to BCAHC-1 (+vehicle) exposed to CM/CAFs (+vehicle) sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05); (black square) indicates significant differences with respect to BCAHC-1 (+Insulin) exposed to CM/CAFs (+vehicle) sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05); (black circle) indicates significant differences with respect to BCAHC-1 (+vehicle) exposed to CM/CAFs (+Insulin) sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05); (white circle) indicates significant differences with respect to BCAHC-1 (+Insulin) exposed to CM/CAFs (+Insulin) sample (p\u2009<\u20090.05)Considering the pivotal role played by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in BC development and metastasis, we evaluated whether insulin may engage the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling, leading to aggressive features in BCAHC-1 cells. Hence, in order to visualize the F-actin pattern CM from CAFs exposed to vehicle and insulin was collected and used as culture medium in BCAHC-1 cells, which were previously treated with vehicle and insulin. These experimental conditions allowed us to observe a marked increase in F-actin assembly in BCAHC-1 cells treated with insulin and cultured with CM from insulin-stimulated CAFs (Fig.\u00a06A, B). These effects were prevented using the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and metformin (Fig.\u00a06A, B). The aforementioned findings were corroborated by transwell migration assays performed in BCAHC-1 cells that were previously treated with insulin and cultured as described above. Of note, the migration of BCAHC-1 cells prompted by insulin was further potentiated culturing cells with CM obtained from insulin-treated CAFs (Fig.\u00a06C, D), however this response was no longer evident treating BCAHC-1 cells with AMD3100 and metformin (Fig.\u00a06C, D). Similarly, three-dimensional motility assays showed that AMD3100 and metformin prevent the outflow from the matrigel drop of insulin-treated BCAHC-1 cells cultured with CM from insulin-stimulated CAFs (Fig.\u00a07A, B). Taken together, these results suggest that the insulin-activated CXCL12/CXCR4 axis sustains a paracrine feedforward loop coupling cancer and stromal cells, thus fostering a motile phenotype in BCAHC-1 cells.DiscussionInsulin-resistance and related metabolic disorders, such as obesity, T2D and metabolic syndrome, contribute to cancer development and progression dysregulating many oncogenic pathways mediated by hormones, growth factors and cytokines. For instance, an early indicator of metabolic dysfunction as hyperinsulinemia, has been considered an independent risk and prognostic factor for BC. In this regard, insulin has been shown to facilitate BC progression through multiple signaling pathways that promote mitogenic and metastatic responses. An additional insight toward a better understanding of insulin action in BC derives from the observation that the IR isoform A (IR-A) is frequently overexpressed in BC patients. Contrary to the isoform B (IR-B) that is predominantly expressed in adult tissues and mediates metabolic effects of insulin, IR-A is involved in fetal development and is re-expressed in malignant tissues, where it triggers the oncogenic responses to insulin. In addition, it should be mentioned that the dysregulation of the IR-A/IR-B ratio may be involved in pro-tumorigenic effects elicited by insulin. In this scenario, we have recently isolated a naturally immortalized BC cell line named BCAHC\u20101, which is distinguished by a peculiar receptor expression profile that may allow to better dissect the mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effects of insulin/IR-A axis in BC. Considering that insulin and IGFs are able to bind to and activate each other\u2019s receptors and share common downstream signaling pathways, BCAHC\u20101 cells may represent a valuable model system for a comprehensive evaluation of insulin/IR signaling in BC.Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is the most commonly prescribed drug for T2D treatment worldwide, displaying a remarkable balance between efficacy and safety profile. The effectiveness of metformin in improving the sensitivity to insulin, and therefore in lowering insulin circulating levels, may provide a rationale to investigate the potential benefits of metformin in cancer patients affected by metabolic disorders. As it concerns BC, several preclinical findings have demonstrated that metformin can interfere with cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, metformin may modify the expression of main pro-tumorigenic genes and exert a synergic action with chemotherapeutics in BC cells. Therefore, metformin has been suggested as a potential antitumoral agent in BC also considering the results of epidemiological studies in both diabetic and non-diabetic women. Cumulatively, these data recently paved the way for numerous trials aimed at investigating whether patients with diverse BC subtypes may take advantage from the use of metformin either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics. In this regard, a recent meta-analysis revealed an increased objective response rate (ORR) in metformin-treated patients with inoperable BCs. Moreover, data from a prospective study evidenced that the use of metformin is associated with a decreased risk of progression in ER-positive BC associated with T2D, whereas this beneficial effect was absent in ER-negative BC associated with T2D. These investigations may suggest that ER is involved in the reduced risk of BC by metformin, likely through the inhibition of either ER expression or ER-mediated transcriptional activity. Accordingly, we have previously demonstrated that a bi-directional crosstalk between ER\u03b146 and IR may occur in BCAHC\u20101 cells upon estrogen and insulin stimulation toward growth and pulmonary metastases, in line with the cooperation between ER\u03b1 and IR transduction pathways assessed in BC cells.In this study, we provide novel insights on the ability of metformin to prevent BC growth and motility stimulated by insulin/IR signaling. First, an integrated bioinformatics analysis allowed us to show that the expression and activation of IR are both associated with a worse outcome in ER-positive respect to ER-negative BC patients. Next, we focused on the characterization of the molecular mechanisms by which metformin might inhibit the stimulatory responses triggered by the insulin/IR axis in an IGF-deficient model system as BCAHC\u20101 cells. In line with previous evidence demonstrating that metformin lowers IR phosphorylation, we observed that metformin inhibits the insulin-dependent activation of IR in BCAHC\u20101 cells, without changes in IR expression. Previous studies have also reported a reduction or even an increase of IR protein levels upon metformin treatment, suggesting a differential regulation of IR expression depending on the cell context. We next ascertained that in BCAHC\u20101 cells metformin prevents the activation of two main insulin-stimulated signaling pathways, namely PI3K/AKT and MAPK, leading to the downregulation of insulin target genes like c-Fos and Cyclin D1. In accordance with these data, metformin was shown to down-regulate the expression of transcription factors as well as cell-cycle regulators. Nicely recapitulating these observations, we found that metformin inhibits the proliferative responses triggered by insulin in BCAHC-1 cells, including cell cycle progression, spheroids expansion and colony formation. Notably, metformin increased the proportion of BCAHC-1 cells in G0/G1 phase, reduced cell growth and inhibited the rate of colony formation. Reminiscing previous studies revealing that metformin exerts per se anti-proliferative effects in BC through diverse mechanisms, our current findings may suggest the potential usefulness of metformin toward new comprehensive strategies targeting BC.Cartoon depicting metformin action in BCAHC-1 cells. Metformin inhibits the insulin-induced IR, MEK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT activation, c-fos and Cyclin D1 expression as well as proliferative responses in BCAHC-1 cells. Moreover, metformin reduces the insulin-driven feedforward loop linking CXCR4 induction in BCAHC-1 cells to CXCL12 secretion by CAFs, therefore preventing BCAHC-1 cell motilityThe tumor microenvironment has been recognized as an important player in BC progression toward the acquisition of aggressive features. CAFs, which are the largest population of stromal cells of BC, influence cancer growth and metastatic spread through the secretion of a variety of hormones, growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. In this vein, a distinctive pro-inflammatory molecule released by CAFs is the chemokine CXCL12, which drives a metastatic phenotype interacting with the cognate receptor CXCR4. CXCR4 is a G protein-coupled chemokine receptor implicated in hemopoietic cell trafficking from bone marrow and lymphoid organs. In addition, emerging data have strengthened the prominent role of CXCR4 in regulating many aspects of BC progression as growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis and resistance to therapies. In particular, the signaling cascade triggered by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis orchestrates the chemotaxis of BC cells towards CXCL12-enriched tissues, which may therefore arrange the metastatic niche. In the present study, CXCR4 emerged as one of the most induced metastatic genes in BCAHC-1 cells exposed to insulin. In line with previous findings showing an association between CXCR4 expression and poor outcome in BC patients, we performed bioinformatic analysis in ER-positive BC cohorts of patients. Notably, we found that high levels of both CXCR4 and IR are correlated with a worse DFI in ER-positive BC patients. On this basis and considering that a crosstalk between IGF and CXCR4 promotes migratory responses in BC cells, we assessed that the up-regulation of CXCR4 expression induced by insulin in BCAHC-1 cells is prevented by metformin. Of note, we also found that insulin triggers CXCL12 induction and release in CAFs. Consistent with the recognized ability of stromal cells to acquire a metastatic secretory phenotype upon insulin exposure, we next demonstrated that insulin may drive a feed-forward loop coupling CXCL12 secretion by CAFs to CXCR4 induction in BCAHC-1 cells. Remarkably, we showed that metformin inhibits the acquisition of a migratory and invasive phenotype by BCAHC-1 cells sustained through the aforementioned cooperative network (as schematically depicted in Fig.\u00a08). Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to determine whether metformin may prevent BC motility also via other mechanisms, for instance interfering with recently-identified targets of insulin signaling like the actin filament cross-linking protein filamin-A (FLNA), which has been implicated in the growth and metastatic spread of BC and other hormone-dependent tumors. Overall, our data may provide novel insights on the usefulness of metformin in combination therapies targeting the growth effects and motility of the insulin/IR axis in BC.Supplementary InformationAbbreviationsACTBActin betaAMPKAdenosine monophosphate activated protein kinaseAKTProtein kinase BBCBreast cancerBCABicinchoninic acidCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCMConditioned mediumCXCL12C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12CXCR4CXC chemokine receptor 4DAPI4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindoleDFIDisease-free intervalDMEM/F-12Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12DN/c-FosDominant negative c-FosEMTEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transitionEREstrogen receptorER\u03b14646 kDa ER\u03b1 splice variantERK1/2Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2FAP\u03b1Fibroblast activation protein alphaFBSFetal bovine serumFLNAFilamin-AGFRGrowth Factor ReducedIGF-1RInsulin-like growth factor 1 receptorIGFsInsulin-like growth factorsIRInsulin receptorIR-AIR isoform AIR-BIR isoform BISR1Insulin receptor substrate 1MAPKMitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK/ERK kinasemTORMechanistic target of rapamycinORRObjective response rateOSOverall survivalPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPIPropidium iodidePI3KPhosphoinositide 3-kinasepRL-TKHSV-thymidine kinase promoterRSEMRNA-Seq by expectation\u2013maximizationSDSSodium dodecyl sulfateT2DType 2 diabetesTCGAThe Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of the Cancer Genome AtlasPublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Domenica Scordamaglia, Francesca Cirillo and Marianna Talia contributed equally to this workAuthor contributionsDS, FC, RL and MM conceived and designed the study.

Although these functions could support a tumor suppressor function for geminin, ablation in mouse embryos or human cells didn\u2032t induce endoreplication or tumorigenesis without stimulus. To date, there have never been any reports describing any genetic or epigenetic alterations in the geminin gene in human breast cancer. Our sequencing efforts of the whole gene in ~150 breast tumors confirmed this lack of alterations in geminin gene.In contrast, geminin is overexpressed in many cancers, including breast cancers, suggesting an oncogenic function instead for\u00a0geminin. Mechanisms to explain this oncogenic role range from ability to maintain pluripotency in early cell lineages, promotion of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in embryonic stem cells, and geminin ability to control proper cytokinesis in G2/M/early G1-phases in normal human mammary epithelial (HME) cells, while cytokinesis failure and production of aneuploid, aggressive breast cancer cells when overexpressed.In normal cells, during G2/M/early G1, geminin helps Aurora B chromosome condensation function, and TopoII\u03b1 chromosome decatenation function. In breast cancer cells, geminin overexpression blocks Aurora B histone H3-(serine 10) phosphorylation, leading to failure in chromosome condensation, aborted cytokinesis, and aneuploidy. In geminin-overexpressing breast cancer cells, TopoII\u03b1 is prematurely de-sumoylated and released from chromosomal decatenation sites, also leading to aneuploidy due to elevated chromosomal breakage.Our recent work showed that, while during S-phase, geminin is a nuclear soluble-serine/threonine (S/T) phosphorylated protein, during G2/M/early G1-phases, it becomes chromatin bound-tyrosine (Y) phosphorylated protein. While overexpression of wild-type geminin triggers aneuploidy, a single Y-to-A mutant geminin (contains 3 Y-residues at position: 98, 111, and 150) triggers apoptosis, suggesting geminin oncogenic function requires simultaneous phosphorylation on all 3Ys, implicating the upstream kinases in this function. Our intense search for these kinases revealed the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Abl phosphorylates geminin-Y150 in vitro, and in vivo. Indeed, imatinib and nilotinib (two c-Abl inhibitors) promote geminin-overexpressing cell death, in vitro, and geminin-overexpressing tumor regression, in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of several large human breast tumor cohorts revealed geminin overexpression in ~50% of the tumors, while c-Abl overexpression in >90% of the tumors. These analyses also revealed geminin-negative tumors (i.e., expressing normal tissue level), overexpress cytoplasmic c-Abl, while geminin-overexpressing tumors (especially TNBCs) overexpress nuclear c-Abl. We now refer to geminin/nuclear c-Abl co-overexpressing tumors as \u201cGemOE\u201d tumors.High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a ubiquitous DNA-binding protein with essential DNA metabolism functions. HMGB1 can be released passively from necrotic cells or actively from activated immune cells, hypoxic, or inflamed cancer cells. HMGB1 secretion requires hyper-acetylation on the chromatin. Recently, we described how geminin helps acetylate chromatic HMGB1 and release it from\u00a0GemOE tumor cells, where it through binding to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) on GemOE tumor cells activates NF-\u03baB-induced survival, especially those exposed to the harsh condition of hypoxia and inflammation within the tumor core (aka \u201caggressiveness niche\u201d). Binding of extracellular Ac-HMGB1 to RAGE on na\u00efve mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) activates NF-\u03baB signaling-induced CXCR4 expression. CXCR4-expressing MSCs are then recruited to CXCL12/SDF1-secreting GemOE cells, in vitro, and into the aggressiveness niche, in vivo.We expand these data, here, and show MSCs activated by Ac-HMGB1 secrete the calcium-binding protein, S100A4 (aka metastasin), a known promoter of breast cancer proliferation, invasion, and\u00a0metastasis. In, TNBCs, expression of a nuclear/cytoplasmic S100A4 is associated with high histological tumor grade and inferior metastasis-free and overall survival. We show S100A4 entrains GemOE cells to recruit macrophages into the aggressiveness niche and polarizes them to Gas6-secreting M2-TAMs. GemOE tumor cells overexpress the tyrosine kinase receptor, AXL, that binds Gas6. AXL is overexpressed in breast cancers (especially ER\u03b1-negative tumors). Activation of AXL and RAGE in GemOE tumor cells converts them into metastatic precursors capable of dissemination from primary tumors through exacerbating the stemness and EMT phenotypes in them, and the expression and functional interaction of the intravasation-inducing CD151 and \u03b13\u03b21-integrin.ResultsGemOE cells recruit and activate MSCs into S100A4-secreting CAFsGemOE cells recruit and activate MSCs.

(F) The level of S100A4 secreted from MSCs exposed 24\u2009h to indicated cell lines CM\u00a0under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in the absence or presence of HMGB1 NeuAb. Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (G) Schematic representation showing the data discussed in the Figure.Extracellular Ac-HMGB1 activation of RAGE on na\u00efve MSCs triggers CXCR4 expression and recruitment towards CXCL12-secreting GemOE cells. To expand these data, normal HME, or two of the 1\u00b0 orthotopic GemOE mammary tumors; Gem240, and Gem257 cells were grown (24\u2009h) under normoxia (20% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) in Dox-containing media in the presence or absence of imatinib. ELISA revealed that compared to CM from cells expressing low-level geminin, induced Gem240 and Gem257 cells CM contained ~3-fold higher HMGB1 (Fig.\u00a01A, white, and compare white to blue, Suppl. Fig.\u00a01). Hypoxia did not affect normal HME or Dox-uninduced cells (Fig.\u00a01, red, and compare blue and black, Suppl. Fig.\u00a01), while exacerbated HMGB1 secretion from Dox-induced cells (Fig.\u00a01A, red, and Suppl. Fig.\u00a01). Imatinib blocked hypoxia-induced effects (compare black to red, Fig.\u00a01A). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a02).Na\u00efve MSCs (see [\u2212], Fig.\u00a01B) are RAGE-negative, remain negative after exposure to HME cells CM (Fig.\u00a01B). In contrast, exposure (24\u2009h) to Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells CM induced RAGE expression on MSCs surface (blot for membrane proteins, Fig.\u00a01B). In contrast, whether na\u00efve or exposed to CM from any of these cell lines, MSCs express equally high levels of TLR4 (a second HMGB1 receptor) on their surface (Fig.\u00a01B).RNAs were isolated from na\u00efve MSCs exposed (24\u2009h) to Ac-rHMGB1 (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml), or CM from Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells in the presence of vehicles (IgG isotype\u2009+\u2009DMSO), HMGB1 neutralizing antibody (NeuAb, 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml), imatinib, TLR4 TAK-242, glycyrrhizin, Bay 11-7082, or MK-2206. RT/qPCR showed RAGE mRNA increases ~30fold in na\u00efve MSCs exposed to Ac-rHMGB1, or CM from Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells (compare [\u2212] to vehicles, white, Fig.\u00a01C). All drugs except glycyrrhizin and MK-2206 blocked this increase (white bars, Fig.\u00a01C). Moreover, previously, we showed that CXCR4 expression increases in na\u00efve MSCs by Ac-HMGB1 downstream of RAGE. CXCR4 mRNA level was also increased by ~30fold in na\u00efve MSCs exposed to Ac-rHMGB1 or CM from Dox-induced Gem240 cells or Gem257 cells (compare [\u2212] to vehicle, black bars, Fig.\u00a01C). All drugs except MK-2206 blocked this increase in CXCR4 mRNA expression (black bars, Fig.\u00a01C). Together reinforce our previous published data and expand them to show Ac-HMGB1 activates TLR4 first to trigger RAGE expression, which then also through activation by Ac-HMGB1 triggers CXCR4 expression. Noteworthy, Ac-HMGB1 in both situations activated NF-\u03baB rather than AKT signaling in MSCs.Na\u00efve MSCs layered in inserts of Boyden chambers efficiently migrated towards Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells CM not MSCs CM or HME cells CM added in the lower chamber within 24\u2009h (Fig.\u00a01D). The recruitment was almost completely blocked in the presence of HMGB1 or CXCL12 NeuAbs (Fig.\u00a01D). Together, reinforce that a primary function for RAGE/CXCR4 activation in na\u00efve MSCs is to promote their\u00a0 migration\u00a0towards GemOE tumor cells (step 1, Fig.\u00a01G).Unlike na\u00efve MSCs (Fig.\u00a01B), HME and Dox-induced GemOE cells express no TLR4 while expressing equally high-levels of RAGE on their surface (Fig.\u00a01E, upper). Hypoxia did not alter this pattern (Fig.\u00a01E, lower). RAGE also binds the S100 family members. Since RAGE is constitutively expressed on GemOE cells, we evaluated whether activated MSCs express/release HMGB1 or S100 proteins.RNAs were isolated from na\u00efve MSCs exposed (24\u2009h) to na\u00efve MSCs CM, normal HME cells CM, Dox-induced Gem240, or Gem257 cells CM. RT/qPCR showed that only exposure to Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM induced expression of S100A2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, not S100A1, 7, or HMGB1 mRNAs in na\u00efve MSCs (Suppl. Fig.\u00a03A). Because of\u00a0S100A4 role in breast cancer metastasis, we pursued it further. We found that HMGB1 NeuAb blocked the elevation of S100A4 mRNAs expression in MSCs following exposure to Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM (Suppl. Fig.\u00a03B).Moreover, ELISA showed that neither normal HME cells nor Dox-induced GemOE cells secrete S100A4 (not shown). In contrast, na\u00efve MSCs exposed (24\u2009h) to Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM only secrete high-levels of S100A4 (Fig.\u00a01F, white bars). This secretion increased further when hypoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells CM was used instead (Fig.\u00a01F, red) and almost completely blocked by HMGB1 NeuAb (Fig.\u00a01F, black). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a04). Together suggest that in the vicinity of GemOE cells, MSCs differentiate into S100A4-secreting cancer-associated fibroblasts (i.e., CAFs, Fig.\u00a01G, step 2).S100A4-activated GemOE cells attract and polarize macrophages into Gas6-secreting M2-TAMsRecently, we showed that IRISOE cells secrete high-levels of CCL2, in vitro, and in vivo to recruit macrophages. To define whether bidirectional interaction between GemOE cells and MSCs through S100A4 exists was studied next.MSCs-reactivated GemOE cells recruit and activate macrophages. (A) Schematic representation of the co-culture experiments performed in this study. (B) The level of CCL2 secreted from the indicated cell lines under normoxic or hypoxic condition co-cultures with MSCs in the absence or presence of S100A4 NeuAb or glycyrrhizin. Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (C) Real-time RT/PCR analysis of the CCR2 mRNA in THP1-macrophages exposed 24\u2009h to the co-cultures of the indicated cell lines with MSCs supplemented with CCL2 NeuAb or BMS CCR2 22.

The blot was repeated 3 separate times. (E) The effect of the CM from the indicated co-cultures with MSCs for 24 on the migration of THP1-macrophages performed for 24\u2009h in Boyden chambers in the presence of vehicle or CCL2 NeuAb. Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (F) The levels of AXL in the indicated cells. The blot was repeated 3 separate times. (G) The level of Gas6 secreted from THP1-macrophages exposed 24\u2009h to the indicated co-cultures generated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions in the absence or presence of CCL2 NeuAb or BMS CC2 22. Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (H) Schematic representation showing the data discussed in the Figure.CM from normal HME cells or Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (24\u2009h) re-conditioned by exposure to MSCs (another 24\u2009h, Fig.\u00a02A1) were re-added to the same cell line in the absence or presence of S100A4 NeuAb or glycyrrhizin (24\u2009h, Fig.\u00a02A2). ELISA showed MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, blue), and normal HME cells exposed to their normoxic or hypoxic CM re-conditioned by MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, orange and red, respectively) or not (Fig.\u00a02B, white) did not secrete CCL2. In contrast, Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells secreted low-levels of CCL2 when exposed to their CM (Fig.\u00a02B, white), slightly increased following exposure to their normoxic CM re-conditioned by MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, orange), and increased even further when exposed to their hypoxic CM reconditioned by MSCs (Fig.\u00a02B, red). Importantly, S100A4 NeuAb (Fig.\u00a02B, green) and glycyrrhizin (Fig.\u00a02B, black) both blocked these increases. One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a05).The receptor for CCL2, CCR2, controls the trafficking of monocytes into damaged tissues or tumors. Recently, we showed CCL2 upregulates CCR2 expression on unpolarized macrophages. PMA-treated THP1-macrophages (hereafter THP1s) were exposed (24\u2009h) to HME cells/or Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-cultures CM (Fig.\u00a02A3). Real-time RT/qPCR and western blot analysis of these THP1s showed low-levels CCR2 mRNA in unexposed THP1s ([\u2212], Fig.\u00a02C). While MSCs only CM did not induce CCR2 mRNA and protein expression, a slight increase was detected in THP1s exposed to hypoxic HME cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02C,D). In contrast, high-levels CCR2 mRNA was detected in THP1s exposed to hypoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02C). This induction was significantly blocked by CCL2 NeuAb and BMS CCR2 22 (Fig.\u00a02C). Importantly, high-levels CCR2 protein expression was detected in THP1s exposed to Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM only (Fig.\u00a02D). Taken together, confirming the role of\u00a0CCL2 in CCR2 expression in THP1s and primary macrophages.Many THP1s layered in inserts of Boyden chambers migrated 24\u2009h later towards Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-cultures CM only in the lower chambers. Importantly, in the presence of CCL2 NeuAb, this migration was significantly blocked (Fig.\u00a02E), supporting the CCL2/CCR2 role in macrophages recruitment into GemOE tumors.Our analysis of receptors upregulated on the surface of the 1\u00b0 orthotopic GemOE mammary tumors revealed many important metastasis inducing receptors. One such receptor, AXL, was chosen for further analysis in this study due to its pronounced role in intravasation and breast cancer metastasis. Compared to normal HME cells, Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells express significantly higher levels of AXL on their surfaces (western done on cell membrane extracts, Fig.\u00a02F).The ligand for AXL; Gas6 also has a notable role in breast cancer progression. Interestingly, compared to normal HME cells CM, Dox-induced Gem240, or Gem257 cells alone CM induced low-levels Gas6 secretion from THP1s (see Fig.\u00a02A4,G, white). This secretion was significantly increased when THP1s were instead exposed to normoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02G, orange). Even higher secretion was detected when hypoxic Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-culture CM (Fig.\u00a02G, red). Importantly, CCL2 NeuAb and BMS CCR2 22 significantly blocked Gas6 secretion from THP1s exposed to the hypoxic co-cultures CM (Fig.\u00a02G, green and black, respectively). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a06). Together suggest S100A4 re-activate GemOE cells to secrete CCL2 that\u00a0attracts macrophages and polarizes them into Gas6-secreting M2-tumor-associated macrophages (M2-TAMs, Fig.\u00a02H).Imatinib-sensitive MSCs and TAMs recruitment in vivoPreviously, we injected shCtrl-, sh-geminin- or shc-Abl-expressing GemOE cells into athymic female mice mammary fat pads. Geminin- or c-Abl-depleted cells developed <20% size tumors, compared to control cells, supporting the intimate relationship between c-Abl and geminin and giving credence to using imatinib to treat GemOE mammary tumors (especially TNBC) see introduction and.GemOE tumor cells recruit and interact with MSCs and TAMs, in vivo. (A) Schematic representation of the in vivo assay discussed in the Figure. Representative images of GFP-MSCs (B1) or GFP-THP1-macrophages (B2) found in GemOE tumors treated in vivo with vehicle (lefts) or imatinib (rights) according to the protocol in (A). The tumors were dissociated into single cells and cultured overnight before photographing. The numbers of GFP-MSCs (C1) or GFP-THP1-macrophages (C2) found in GemOE tumors treated in vivo with vehicle (blacks) or imatinib (red and organ) according to the protocol in (A).

The levels of HMGB1 (D), CXCL12 (E), and S100A4 (F) in sera isolated from PBs of na\u00efve mice (before tumor cells injection), tumor-bearing mice before or after vehicle or imatinib treatments. (G) Kaplan Meir curve of the recurrence-free survival in indicated numbers of patients overexpressing geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009S100A4 vs. low expressing patients.We injected 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 Gem240 or Gem257 cells in athymic female mice (n\u2009=\u200924/cell line, Fig.\u00a03A), and kept the mice on Dox-supplemented drinking water. Mice developed ~0.5\u2009cm3 tumors within 4weeks, at which time (i.e., day\u00a0-1), mice were randomized into two groups: one received vehicle (DMSO, n\u2009=\u200912/cell line), and the other 10\u2009mg/kg of imatinib (orally, n\u2009=\u200912/cell line, Fig.\u00a03A). We activated GFP-human MSCs (GFP-hMSCs) by culturing for a week in CM from Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells (changed daily), and GFP-THP1s by culturing in Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells/MSCs co-cultures CM (also changed daily). On day (0), 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 of activated GFP-hMSCs or GFP-THP1s were intracardiac (i.c., through the left ventricle) injected in vehicle (n\u2009=\u20096/cell line) or imatinib (n\u2009=\u20096/cell line) treated mice and treatments were administrated at that time and daily thereafter on days 1, 2, and 3 (Fig.\u00a03A). Tumors and peripheral blood (PB) were collected from all mice on day 4 (Fig.\u00a03A).Part of each tumor was dissociated into single cells and grew in culture overnight. Next day GFP+-cells were counted in at least five high magnification fields (HF) from at least three tumors treated with vehicle or imatinib, and data for both cell lines were pooled (similar results). We detected 10.1\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 GFP-hMSCs/HF in cultures from vehicle-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B1, left, and 3C1, black) vs. 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 in cultures from imatinib-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B1, right and 3C1, red, p\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126). Similarly, there was 11.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4 GFP-THP1s/HF in cultures from vehicle-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B2, left and 3C2, black) vs. 1.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6 in cultures from imatinib-treated tumors (Fig.\u00a03B2, right, and 3C2, orange, p\u2009=\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126).ELISA performed on sera isolated from the PBs showed (here too, data for similar treated\u00a0mice were pooled, similar results) that consistent with others and our previous data, HMGB1 level was 14.9\u2009\u00b1\u20097.4\u2009ng/ml in sera from na\u00efve mice (n\u2009=\u200948, Fig.\u00a03D, yellow), increased to 154.0\u2009\u00b1\u200936.3\u2009ng/ml in sera from tumor-bearing mice (n\u2009=\u200948, collected on day (\u22121), p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03D, blue), remained high at 155.2\u2009\u00b1\u200942.9\u2009ng/ml in sera from vehicle-treated mice (n\u2009=\u200924, collected at euthanasia, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03D, red), dropped to 24.8\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5\u2009ng/ml in sera from imatinib-treated mice (n\u2009=\u200924, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03D, brown). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a07).Similarly, CXCL12 level was 1.8\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\u2009ng/ml in sera from na\u00efve mice (Fig.\u00a03E, yellow), increased to 18.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.4\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03E, blue), remained high at 17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20096.3\u2009ng/ml in vehicle-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03E, red), dropped to 4.1\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1\u2009ng/ml in imatinib-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03E, brown). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a08).Finally, S100A4 level was 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u2009ng/ml in sera from na\u00efve mice (Fig.\u00a03F, yellow), increased to 15.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03F, blue), remained high at 16.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.1\u2009ng/ml in vehicle-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03F, red), dropped to 6.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.7\u2009ng/ml in imatinib-treated mice (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a03F, brown). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a09). Interestingly, analysis of TCGA data confirmed that compared to low geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009S100A4-expressing patients, patients expressing high levels had an inferior recurrence-free survival (RFS, p\u2009=\u20090.007, compare red to black, Fig.\u00a03G).Further evidence for the recruitment of MSCs and TAMs into GemOE tumorsBi-directional interaction of GemOE cells\u00a0 with\u00a0stromal cells in GemOE tumors. (A) Schematic representation of the in vivo assay discussed in the Figure. (B) Gem240 tumor volume (Gem257 cells produced identical data) following the protocol described in (A) in the presence of the indicated inhibitors. The red arrow indicates the start of treatments. Student t-test was used to compare vehicle-treated tumors and each treatment separately. Fluorescence IHC staining of sections from the tumors above using mouse-specific anti-CD105 (MSCs specific biomarker) and anti-TLR4 (C), or mouse-specific anti-CD163 (macrophage-specific biomarker) and anti-CCR2 (D). (E) The level of CCL2 (upper) and Gas6 (lower) in na\u00efve mice, tumor-bearing mice before or after vehicle, imatinib, FPS-ZM1, and TAK-242 treatments at tumor resection. (F) Schematic representation showing the data discussed so far.Again, based on our previous experience with imatinib, and because our model specifically calls for macrophages recruitment as a subsequent step for the MSCs recruitment (Fig.\u00a02H), we aimed at further analyze these interactions through inhibiting the two receptors; RAGE and TLR4 we propose mostly involved in MSCs recruitment. We injected 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 Gem240, or Gem257 cells in athymic female mice (n\u2009=\u200924/cell line, see Fig.\u00a04A) kept on Dox-supplemented drinking water. The mice developed ~0.5\u2009cm3 tumor volume within 4weeks, at which time they were randomized into 4 groups received vehicle (DMSO, n\u2009=\u20096), imatinib (10\u2009mg/kg, n\u2009=\u20096), FPS-ZM1 (10\u2009mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.], 1\u2009mg/kg, n\u2009=\u20096), or TAK-242 (10\u2009mg/kg, i.p. n\u2009=\u20096). Drugs were administered 3times/week for 4weeks (Fig.\u00a04A).Vehicle-treated Gem240 (identical results were obtained using Gem257) tumors grow ~200% by day 60 (Fig.\u00a04B, black), while imatinib (Fig.\u00a04B, red), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a04B, green) or TAK-242 (Fig.\u00a04B, blue) treated tumors regressed by ~50% (p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126 for all drugs, Fig.\u00a04B). All tumors were resected, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 4\u2009\u00b5m, and immune-stained. Vehicle-treated tumors only showed high-levels CD105 (mouse MSCs fibrogenic differentiation biomarker)/TLR4 co-stained cells (Fig.\u00a04C1\u20133), and CD163 (M2-macrophage-specific biomarker)/CCR2 co-stained cells (Fig.\u00a04D1\u20133). Imatinib (Fig.\u00a04C5\u20137,D5\u20137), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a04C9\u201311,D9\u201311), or TAK-242 (Fig.\u00a04C13\u201315,D13\u201315) treated mice were negative for both cells.Finally, sera were isolated from PBs from these mice at euthanasia.

One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a010).Similarly, 1.865\u2009\u00b1\u20090.999\u2009ng/ml of Gas6 was detected in na\u00efve mice sera (n\u2009=\u200948, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-black), increased to 33.534\u2009\u00b1\u20096.738\u2009ng/ml in tumor-bearing mice sera (n\u2009=\u200948, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-red), remained high at 35.505\u2009\u00b1\u20094.378 in the vehicle-treated mice sera (n\u2009=\u200912, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a04E, lower-green).

One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a011). Together, suggest blocking HMGB1 secretion or function prevents recruitment of MSCs and TAMs into GemOE tumors and their conversion into pro-tumor S100A4-secreting CAFs and Gas6-secreting M2-TAMs (Fig.\u00a04F) leading to tumor regerssion.The bi-directional loops are involved in GemOE-induced TNBC metastasisThe bi-directional pathways elevate the GemOE tumor metastasis.

At ~0.5\u2009cm3 around week 4, mice were randomized and divided into 4 groups treated with vehicle, imatinib, FPS-ZM1, or R428 daily for 2 weeks (weekend off). Refer to the Results section for more information. Student t-test was used to compare vehicle-treated tumors and each treatment separately.

(H) Kaplan Meir curve of the overall survival of geminin\u2009+\u2009RAGE\u2009+\u2009AXL overexpressing patients vs. low expressing patients.To evaluate HMGB1/S100A4 and CCL2/Gas6 bi-directional loops role in GemOE cells metastatic potential (cf. Fig.\u00a04F), we injected 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 Gem240 or Gem257 cells admixed with 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 hMSCs in female athymic mice (48mice/cell line, Fig.\u00a05A) kept on Dox-supplemented drinking water. The mice developed ~0.5\u2009cm3 tumor volume within 4weeks (Fig.\u00a05A), at which time they were randomized into 4 groups/cell line treated with vehicle (DMSO, n\u2009=\u200912), imatinib (n\u2009=\u200912, 10\u2009mg/kg, orally), FPS-ZM1 (n\u2009=\u200912, 1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.), or R428 (n\u2009=\u200912, 150\u2009mg/kg, orally) daily for 2 weeks (Fig.\u00a05A). Half of the mice were maintained for tumor growth (Fig.\u00a05B). In the other half, tumors were resected in survival surgeries, and metastasis was followed using IVIS for a maximum of 4months (Fig.\u00a05A).Tumors in vehicle-treated mice increased ~50% within the treatment period (Fig.\u00a05B, black). In contrast, tumors in mice treated with imatinib (Fig.\u00a05B, red), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a05B, green), or R428 (Fig.\u00a05B, blue) regressed by >50%.Only in vehicle-treated mice, we detected macro-metastases, especially to the lungs (n\u2009=\u200912, i.e., 6/cell line, Fig.\u00a05C, upper right). Noteworthy, one mouse also developed a lymph-node metastasis (Fig.\u00a05D, upper), and another developed widespread metastasis in almost all organs (Fig.\u00a05D, lower). In contrast, none of the mice injected with either cell line developed metastasis following imatinib (Fig.\u00a05C, lower left), FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a05C, lower middle), or R428 (Fig.\u00a05C, lower right) treatment, although few mice developed very small micro-metastases (arrowheads and insets in Fig.\u00a05C, lower). Detail analysis of these metastases will be reported elsewhere. Importantly, only in vehicle-treated mice, we detected AXL+/vimentin+ cells in the tumors (compare Fig.\u00a05E1\u20134 to E5\u20138,E9\u201312,E13\u201316).To support these data further, we carried out Kaplan Meier analysis using several publicly available breast cancer data sets. Geminin-overexpressing patients had inferior recurrence-free survival (RFS, n\u2009=\u20093955, HR\u2009=\u20091.6, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.43\u20131.78, p\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126, Fig.\u00a05F) and distance metastasis-free survival (DMFS, n\u2009=\u20091747, HR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01\u20131.49, p\u2009=\u20090.039, Fig.\u00a05G). Geminin\u2009+\u2009RAGE\u2009+\u2009AXL-overexpressing patients had inferior overall survival (OS, n\u2009=\u2009594, HR\u2009=\u20092.27, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.28\u20134.03, p\u2009=\u20090.0005681, Fig.\u00a05H), and geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009RAGE\u2009+\u2009CCL2\u2009+\u2009AXL-overexpressing patients had inferior lung metastasis-free survival (LMFS, n\u2009=\u200958, HR\u2009=\u20097.35, 95% CI\u2009=\u20092.38\u201322.63, p\u2009=\u20090.0005123, Suppl. Fig.\u00a012). Together, confirm that positive feedback loops with MSCs/CAFs and/or M2-TAMs, especially within the aggressiveness niche through RAGE and AXL, respectively (cf. Fig.\u00a04F) worsen the outcomes for patients with GemOE/TNBC tumors.AXL and RAGE enhance GemOE cell invasion abilityHME, Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells were switched to Dox-containing serum-free (SF)-media for 24\u2009h before they were treated in Dox-containing SF-media with none or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428, or both for 30\u2009mins or 24\u2009h.The roles of RAGE and AXL in promoting invasion in GemOE tumor cells. The expression of the indicated proteins in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h of growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by a switch to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none, or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428, or FPS-ZM1\u2009+\u2009R428 for 30\u2009mins (A) or 24\u2009h (B). (C) Representative images of the invasion of Dox-induced Gem240 or Gem257 cells through Matrigel-coated inserts of Boyden chambers 24\u2009h after incubation with SF-media supplemented with none, or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1, plus R428, or plus FPS-ZM1\u2009+\u2009R428. (D) Quantitative analysis of the data presented in (C). Assay performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (E) The expression of geminin and AXL in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by switching to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none or S100A4 with or without FPS-ZM1. (F) The expression of geminin and AXL in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF- media followed by switching to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none or Gas6 with or without R428. (G) The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 (pro and active forms) in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by switching to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none, or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1, plus R428, or plus FPS-ZM1\u2009+\u2009R428 for 24\u2009h. (H) Schematic representation showing the data discussed in the Figure.Following 30\u2009min treatments, the membrane/cytoplasmic fractions were isolated. HME cells express no/low-levels of the total (T-)AXL (see below), p-AXLY779, T-AKT, p-AKTT308/S473, T-ERK, p-ERKT183/Y185, NF-\u03baB and survivin under all conditions (Fig.\u00a06A). In contrast, in SF-media, Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells express >5-fold higher T-AXL (see below), T-AKT, NF-\u03baB, and survivin, and similar levels of T-ERK compared to HME cells (Fig.\u00a06A). Treatment with FPS-ZM1, R428, or both did not significantly affect the expression of total proteins (Fig.\u00a06A). Although the levels of p-AXLY779, p-AKTT308/S473, and p-ERKT183/Y185 were not significantly affected by S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle treatment, FPS-ZM1, R428 and even more so in both treatments significantly decreased the levels of these proteins (Fig.\u00a06A), suggesting cross-talk between AXL and RAGE that activates AXL, AKT, and to some extent, ERK signaling in GemOE cells (cf. Fig.\u00a06H).Following the 24\u2009h treatments, cells were sonicated, and whole-cell extracts prepared. HME cells grown in SF-medium expressed low levels of geminin, CDH2, and survivin, while detectable levels of Twist1, Slug, Oct4, and Sox2 (Fig.\u00a06B). In contrast, in SF-media, all Dox-induced GemOE cells expressed high levels of geminin, CDH2, and survivin, and even higher levels of Twist1, Slug, Oct4, and Sox2 compared to HME cells (Fig.\u00a06B). None of the treatments significantly affected the expression of these proteins in HME cells (Fig.\u00a06B), while in SF-media, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle elevated the expression of all proteins to different degrees in the three Dox-induced GemOE cell lines (Fig.\u00a06B). In SF-media, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus FPS-ZM1 significantly decreased the expression of the majority of the proteins except for geminin to different degrees in the three Dox-induced GemOE cell lines (Fig.\u00a06B), plus R428 treatment decreased expression of all proteins in some instances marginally, e.g., Twist and Sox2, yet in others significantly, e.g., Slug and Oct4 (Fig.\u00a06B). In SF-media, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both drugs treatment, decreased the expression of all proteins even geminin to a level similar to that observed with R428 alone (Fig.\u00a06B), suggesting that RAGE perhaps primes AXL effects.Next, we layered Gem240 or Gem257 cells in Matrigel-coated inserts of Boyden chambers. In the lower well, we added SF-media containing Dox and none or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428, or both. After 24\u2009h, we counted cells invaded the Matrigel and migrated to the other side of the inserts as an in vitro confirmation of their stemness and EMT phenotype described above.Although, many Dox-induced Gem240 and Gem257 cells invaded in SF-condition (Fig.\u00a06C,D), a significant increase in the number of invaded cells was detected in the presence of S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle (Fig.\u00a06C,D). On the other hand, in the presence of FPS-ZM1 or R428, S100A\u2009+\u2009Gas6 effect on invasion was significantly blocked (Fig.\u00a06C,D). Again, the reduction in invasion was the same in the presence of both drugs or R428 alone (Fig.\u00a06C,D). One-way ANOVA test followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests confirmed these data (Suppl. Figs.\u00a013 and 14). Together, reinforces that RAGE activation perhaps primes GemOE/TNBC cells to Gas6 effects by affecting geminin and/or AXL expression and/or activity.To test this hypothesis, we grow HME, Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 in Dox-containing SF-media for 24\u2009h then switched them to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with S100A4 plus vehicle or FPS-ZM1 (Fig.\u00a06E) or supplemented with Gas6 plus vehicle or R428 (Fig.\u00a06F). First, in SF-media, S100A4 elevated geminin and AXL levels in all Dox-induced GemOE (not HME) cells (compare green to red in Fig.\u00a06E). Importantly, the expression of geminin and AXL proteins were significantly decreased in the presence of S100A4 plus FPS-ZM1 (compare blue to green in Fig.\u00a06E). It is possible that S100A4/RAGE signaling stabilizes geminin protein (exogenous geminin is expressed from a heterologous promoter) and/or induces its\u00a0transcription. Geminin, then could affect AXL gene transcription and/or protein stabilization.Second, in SF-media, Gas6 did not affect geminin expression, while increased AXL expression in all Dox-induced GemOE cells (compare green to red in Fig.\u00a06F). R428 did not affect geminin expression in Dox-induced GemOE cells but inhibited AXL expression (compare blue to green in Fig.\u00a06F). It is possible that S100A4/RAGE signaling separately affects geminin or AXL. Alternatively, positive feedback between geminin and AXL is also possible. We favor the latter since only in Dox-induced GemOE cells, AXL was expressed (Fig.\u00a06E,F).Finally, in SF-media, Dox-induced Gem240 and Gem257 cells express relatively high levels of pro-/active-MMP2 and -MMP9. Expression of both significantly increased in the presence of S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle (Fig.\u00a06G) and was blocked in the presence of FPS-ZM1, R428, or both drugs (Fig.\u00a06G). The bidirectional interactions with MSCs/CAFs and M2-TAMs through S100A4/RAGE and Gas6/AXL signaling that activated AKT, ERK, and NF-\u03baB in GemOE cells elevate geminin and/or AXL expression triggering TNBC cells stemness, EMT, and their invasion ability (cf. Fig.\u00a06H).AXL and RAGE enhance GemOE cells\u2019 intravasation abilityThe integrin \u03b13 and \u03b21 (hereafter \u03b13\u03b21-integrin) complex with CD151 (expressed specifically on intravasating tumor cells) is essential to initiate and maintains a tight interaction with the extracellular matrices (ECMs); e.g., laminin I (LMN I), collagen IV (COL IV) and fibronectin (FN) on the basal side of endothelial cells of the vessel. To study this in our system, we grew Gem240 or Gem257 for 24\u2009h on uncoated wells or wells that were coated with LMN I, COL IV, or FN in SF-media containing Dox and supplemented with none or S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428 or both. The next day, wells were washed 3 times, and the cells remaining attached to each well were counted in HF and blotted.The roles of RAGE and AXL in promoting intravasation in GemOE tumor cells. (A) The number of Gem240 cells (Gem257 cells showed identical results) attached to non-coated or LMN I-, COL IV-, or FN-coated wells 24\u2009h after platting followed by washing and counting of attached cells in at least 4 HPFs. Each assay was performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (B) The expression of the indicated proteins in the indicated cell lines following 24\u2009h growth in Dox-containing SF-media followed by a switch to Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none, or Gas6 plus vehicle, or plus R428 for 24\u2009h. Note, the actin blot is the same as in Fig.\u00a06F because it is from the same experiment. Percentage of AXL+/\u03b21-integrin+ populations (red), the AXL+/CD151+ populations (white), or \u03b21-integrin+/CD151+ populations (black) derived from FACS analysis of non-permeabilized Dox-induced Gem197 (C), Gem240 (D), and Gem257 (E) treated as indicated. Each assay was performed 3 separate times, each in triplicates. (F) Schematic representation of the data in the entire study as well as future directions.The Gem240 cells (identical results were obtained with Gem257 cells, not shown) showed a high binding ability to uncoated wells under all conditions (white, Fig.\u00a07A). In comparison, binding to LMN I, COL IV, and FN was significantly decreased under SF conditions (none, Fig.\u00a07A). The binding to all matrices was restored in SF containing S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle (Fig.\u00a07A), which was blocked by FPS-ZM1, R428, or both treatments (Fig.\u00a07A). One-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests, confirmed these data (Suppl. Fig.\u00a015). Together, suggest that AXL and/or RAGE positively affect the binding of intravasating tumor cells with the ECM on the vessels within GemOE tumors.To study the contribution of CD151 and \u03b13\u03b21 in this binding, we again in SF-media grow normal HME cells, or Dox-induced Gem197, Gem240, or Gem257 cells in the presence of none, or Gas6 plus vehicle or plus R428. HME expressed very low levels of \u03b13-integrin, \u03b21-integrin, while a high level of \u03b24-integrin (\u03b24) and no CD151 (Fig.\u00a07B). In contrast, in SF-media, all Dox-induced GemOE cell lines expressed high levels of \u03b13-integrin and \u03b21-integrin, low levels of \u03b24-integrin, and very high levels of CD151 (red in Fig.\u00a07B). Gas6 treatment did not affect the expression of these proteins in normal HME cells, but significantly increased expression of \u03b13-integrin, \u03b21-integrin and CD151 in all Dox-induced GemOE cells by >2fold (compare green to red in Fig.\u00a07B). Importantly, inactivating AXL significantly blocked Gas6-induced expression of all four proteins in all Dox-induced GemOE cell lines (compare blue to green in Fig.\u00a07B), suggesting a direct role for AXL in GemOE intravasation ability.To establish this further, Gem197, Gem240, and Gem257 cells (HME cells were omitted from this analysis since they did not express CD151) grown in Dox-containing SF-media supplemented with none or A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, FPS-ZM1, R428 or both (24\u2009h). Non-permeabilized cells were first stained with FITC-anti-CD44, PE-anti-CD24. The stem-like (i.e., CD44+/CD24\u2212) population within each cell line was FACS sorted out and stained with PE-Cy7-anti-AXL, 561 620_20-anti-\u03b21-integrin, and APC-anti-CD151 for FACS analysis.AXL+/\u03b21+ cell populationsAll cell lines contained ~40% of AXL+/\u03b21+ cell populations in SF-media (red, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E), that\u00a0didn\u2019t change in the presence of S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle in any of the cell lines (red, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Although, S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus FPS-ZM1 or plus R428 didn\u2019t change this population in any of the cell lines, in S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both a slightly yet significantly decreased in the AXL+/\u03b21+-populations in all cell lines was detected (red, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E).AXL+/CD151+ cell populationsAll cell lines contained >60% of AXL+/CD151+ cell populations in SF-media (white, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E), that\u00a0didn\u2019t change in S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1 or plus R428 treatments (white, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Importantly, a significant decrease in the percentage of the AXL+/CD151+ population was observed in all cell lines following S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both drug treatment (Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E).\u03b21-integrin+/CD151+ cell populationsAll cell lines contained 25\u201340% of \u03b21+/CD151+ cell populations in SF-media (black, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Again, this percentage was not significantly changed in S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus vehicle, plus FPS-ZM1 or plus R428 treatments (black, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Importantly, a significant decrease in the percentage of this \u03b21+/CD151+ cell populations was observed in all cell lines following treatment with S100A4\u2009+\u2009Gas6 plus both drugs (black, Fig.\u00a07C\u2013E). Taken together, we propose that GemOE triggers expression and/or activation of AXL and RAGE through interactions with the microenvironment that, in turn, enhances the expression and the functional interaction between \u03b13\u03b21-integrin and CD151. This complex by tightly binding to the ECM on the tumor side of endothelial cells enhances the intravasation ability of GemOE/TNBC metastatic precursors through the endothelium barrier upon dissemination (cf. Fig.\u00a07F).DiscussionThe vast majority of breast cancer deaths are due to metastatic diseases. Inflammation and hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment, especially the core (i.e., the aggressiveness niche) exacerbate metastasis. Here, we elucidated the mechanistic role of the bi-directional interactions between GemOE tumor cells and the microenvironment in promoting GemOE metastatic precursors invasion and intravasation abilities.MSCs and TAMs are recruited into tumors through tumor secreted factors. MSCs are recruited by Ac-HMGB1/CXCL12, while TAMs by CCL2. We resolved an issue that was unclear in our previous study, how Ac-HMGB1 induced CXCR4 expression through RAGE in the RAGE-negative na\u00efve MSCs? We found that Ac-HMGB1 activates TLR4 first, which then upregulates RAGE expression in na\u00efve MSCs (cf. Fig.\u00a01G). Earlier reports also showed that HMGB1 promotes CXCR4 expression through RAGE and TLR4.Interestingly, in our experiments, Ac-HMGB1 activated NF-\u03baB rather than AKT signaling via TLR4. A recent study showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling activates AKT via TLR4 to promote breast cancer metastasis. It is possible that during breast cancer metastasis, Ac-HMGB1 and LPS each initiate a specific signaling pathway downstream of TLR4.Another important aspect of our studies is that extracellular S100A4 instigates a tumor-supportive microenvironment in GemOE/TNBC tumors, as was recently shown. High S100A4 expression associates with poor outcome in early-stage cancers and direct interaction between S100A4 and RAGE was recently shown to promote motility in colorectal cancer cells via ERK-dependent mechanism, and prostate cancer cells via NF-\u03baB-activated pathway. Chronic inflammation enhances RAGE expression in many cancers, which was directly linked to low-rate patient survival. In our current analysis of a public dataset of >1700 breast cancer samples, low RFS in patients with high geminin\u2009+\u2009HMGB1\u2009+\u2009S100A4 (two RAGE ligands)-expressing patients was observed (Fig.\u00a03H). This observation supports the conclusion that RAGE signaling is involved in enhancing aggressiveness in GemOE TNBC tumors (cf. Fig.\u00a03G). We propose that Ac-HMGB1 plays a previously unappreciated role in early-stage TNBCs.TAMs presence within TNBC tumors is recognized as a critical factor in tumor progression and could be a prognostic factor of a worse outcome. Most human tumors exhibit TAMs with an M2-like phenotype involved in promoting EMT and contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance. In keeping, the presence of a high number of CD163+-M2 macrophages in GemOE orthotopic TNBC tumors was correlated with aggressive behavior. We propose that TAM secretome, including Gas6, contributes to this aggressiveness through activation of the AXL receptor, which is overexpressed on GemOE/TNBC tumor cells. Indeed, recently published reports demonstrate that mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells induce the release of Gas6 selectively from M2-type macrophages.It is possible that along with c-Abl, AXL is an additional therapeutic target to prevent GemOE metastatic precursors dissemination from TNBC primaries. It is possible that in vivo selective inhibition of AXL using R428 could cooperate with imatinib to impair GemOE/TNBC cell invasion and intravasation, entrapping these GemOE/TNBC metastatic precursors within primaries to be resected during surgery reducing the metastatic burden. In support of this conclusion, we found that high geminin\u2009+\u2009AXL expression was associated with reduced RFS, DMFS, OS and LMFS in TNBC patients (cf. Fig.\u00a05F\u2013H, and Suppl. Fig.\u00a012)Our study has some limitations. Although, we provide evidence for intrinsic ability in GemOE/TNBC tumor cells to recruit and activate stromal elements, such as MSCs and TAMs, the specific requirement of RAGE and AXL for the interaction with MSCs and TAMs, and the distinct biological role in different subtypes of the TNBC disease warrant further studies. Despite these limitations, our results suggest that RAGE and AXL are prognostic indicators of outcome in GemOE/TNBCs patients.Another limitation is the fact that direct testing for S100A4 in TAMs recruitment into GemOE/TNBC tumors should be done, in vivo. Although all the drugs used in this study are specific for their cognate target, their effect in our system should be tested in future studies to provide mechanistic insight, for instance, using the same assays except in cell lines harboring knockdown/knockout of these targets. Also, in future assays, we will assess whether the recruitment of M2-macrophages only or the macrophages, in general, is affected by imatinib, for example, using FACS analysis for the CD11b/F4/80 population within GemOE/TNBC tumors.Moreover, we demonstrated AXL-mediated elevation in CD151, \u03b13, and \u03b21-integrin expression and functional interaction enhance binding to ECM in vitro, which could also be the case on vessels within tumors. This observation would be consistent with previous reports suggesting AXL\u2019s role in breast cancer cells intravasation of the endothelium barrier into the bloodstream. Noteworthy here, in preliminary data (not shown), we found that \u03b21-integrin is phosphorylated in GemOE. An exciting possibility is that this phosphorylation is AXL- or AXL/CD151-driven. In support of the former, R428 abolished this phosphorylation event in GemOE cells (not shown). CD151 may also be a target along with c-Abl and AXL for therapy of GemOE/TNBC tumors.Our analysis showing the opposite effect for GemOE on \u03b24-integrin expression is intriguing. At present, the functional significance of this observation remains unknown. It is possible since \u03b13\u03b24-integrin is also a receptor for ECM binding in breast cancers, that \u03b24 is involved in the extravasation rather than the intravasation step of GemOE/TNBC metastatic spread, as described recently. This will be investigated further in a follow-up study. Another critical experiment that will also be reported in a soon to be published article is the importance of MSCs/CAFs in the proposed intravasation of GemOE/TNBC cells.These findings implicate synergistic signals simultaneously mediate multiple mechanisms in GemOE/TNBC intravasation. This study provides new understanding of the signaling pathways activated in GemOE/TNBC cells through interactions with stromal cells (MSCs/CAFs and M2-TAMs) that modulate the intravasation ability of tumor cells and underlines the importance of probing the process of tumor dissemination from an essential yet hitherto under-explored bi-directional interactions between GemOE/TNBC tumor cells and their microenvironmental cells. The dependence of tumor intravasation on the microenvironment provides yet another point of intervention to prevent tumor cell dissemination and patients\u2019 demise.MethodsCell cultureHuman MSCs were purchased from Texas A&M HSC COM Institute for Regenerative Medicine, expanded, and frozen down. THP-1 cells were purchased from ATCC (catalog number: TIB-202TM), expanded, and frozen down. For both cell types, one vial is usually propagated for \u22645 generations to perform experiments before a new vail is used. Parental HME cell line (i.e., normal HME, used as control through the studies performed here) was transfected with a retrovirus expressing doxycycline (Dox)-inducible geminin allele. Several clones from these cells were generated by antibiotic-selection, expanded, and tested for geminin expression. A clone named Gem9 overexpressing a level of geminin similar to that observed in breast cancer cell lines was selected to use further. Gem9 cells were orthotopically injected in Dox-supplemented female SCID mice mammary fat pads (n\u2009=\u200910) and the primary (1\u00b0)-geminin overexpressing tumors developed were collected and used to generate the 1\u00b0 geminin-overexpressing tumor cell lines we named; Gem197, Gem240, Gem256, Gem257, and Gem270. These cell lines were described earlier, and are usually maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotics, and 2\u2009\u00b5g/ml doxycycline to induce geminin expression will be used to perform the assays in this study.

R-S100A4 (GTX62977) was from GeneTax. All antibodies were tested before use.Serum isolation from mouse bloodSerum over plasma was chosen to study because it is more representative of inflammation. Samples were collected in a covered test tube and allowed to clot undisturbed at RT for ~30\u2009min. The clot was then removed by centrifuging at 1,000\u20132,000\u2009g for 10\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The isolated serum is immediately transferred into a clean polypropylene tube aliquoted into 0.5\u2009\u00b5l aliquots and stored in \u221280\u2009\u00b0C.ELISA analysisWells of a PVC microtiter plate were coat with the antigen by pipetting 50\u2009\u03bcl of the conditioned medium (CM) or Serum (or dilution thereof in PBS) in triplicates and plate covered and incubated for overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After washing 3x with PBS, blocking of none-specific sites was done using 5% BSA in PBS incubated for ~2\u2009h at room temperature (RT) followed by 3x washing in PBS. Diluted 1\u00b0 antibody was added for 2\u2009hours at RT, followed by 3x washing in PBS. HRP-conjugated 2\u00b0 antibody diluted in blocking buffer was incubated 1\u2009hour at RT then 3x washed with PBS. Detection using OPD (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) tables and detection at 492\u2009nm was done.Cytokine arrayHME and HME/geminin cells were assessed for differential cytokine secretion using human cytokine antibody array (RayBio). Conditioned media from an equal number of HME and HME/geminin cells plated in a serum-free medium for 20\u2009h under standard conditions were used to perform according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and previously described.Co-culture experimentBoyden chambers (BD biosciences) of 8\u2009\u00b5m (for migration) or 0.4\u2009\u00b5m (for secretome) pore size were used. Certain cells (or their CM) were layered in the lower chamber with or without neutralizing antibodies, and test cells were layered in the transwell inserts. Cells migrated to the lower compartment of the Boyden chamber were counted and plotted 24\u2009h later. Occasionally, hypoxia was introduced.Conditioned media transfer experimentConditioned medium (CM) generated for analysis of secreted cytokines and surface receptor expression under normoxia (20% O2 for 24\u2009h), or hypoxia (1% O2 for 24\u2009h) conditions from an equal number of cells were transferred onto MSCs in the presence or absence of drugs or NeuAb. MSCs re-CM medium was transferred onto HME or GemOE cells with or without drugs or NeuAb for 24\u2009h to re-reconditioned. The resultant CM was then transferred to an equal number of THP1-macrophages for 24\u2009h to be re-re-reconditioned. Finally, this CM was re-added onto HME or GemOE cells for 24\u2009h. At every step, the receiving cells were seeded at equal numbers to avoid number variations discrepancies. At various points, ELISA on CM and western blot on membrane fractions or whole-cell extracts generated by sonication was done.Quantitative Real-time RT/PCRIn brief, 100\u2009ng of total RNA isolated using TRIzol was used for qRT/PCR using iScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad) as previously described.

All experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and regulations. Six- to eight-week-old anesthetized immune-compromised Nu/Nu (Harlan) mice were injected with cells re-suspended in 100\u2009\u00b5l RPMI medium and Matrigel (1:1) using a 27-gauge needle orthotopically in the 2nd left mammary gland. Tumors were monitored weekly by i.p. injection of 100\u2009\u00b5l of D-luciferin (15\u2009mg/mL in PBS) and anesthetized mice using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane gas were photographed for luciferase in vivo signals with IVIS machine (Xenogen). Tumor volume was assessed twice weekly by caliper (Life Sciences) using the formula L.W/2 (L\u2009=\u2009longest and W\u2009=\u2009shortest diameter of the tumor). Tumor initiation was defined as the time when tumors were 3\u2009mm in diameter. Mice were sacrificed when the tumors reached <1.5\u2009cm3 in volume or at the indicated time points in Results. At the end of the experiments, mice were euthanized by compressed 100% CO2 gas, tumors and organs (e.g., lung) were resected, weighed, fixed in formalin, and later cut at 4\u2009\u00b5m for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Some tumor parts were flash-frozen for DNA, RNA, and protein preparation later. In some instances, from anesthetized mice (using a mix of oxygen and isoflurane gas), 200\u2009\u00b5l of blood was drawn from the heart before they were euthanized.In vivo drug treatmentsTumor-bearing mice were treated with the drugs, concentration, and routes indicated in Results.Preparation and injection of GFP-MSCs or -THP1sGFP-expressing MSCs or THP1 were generated using lentivirus GFP-expressing plasmid. Antibiotics selected clones were propagated and stored frozen. Tumor-bearing mice and treated as described in Results were intracardiac injected through the left ventricle. Following tumor resection, part of the tumor was dissociated using Collagenase I and the protocol used by, grown in culture for 24\u2009h to adhere, and GFP-cells were photographed, counted, and plotted using Prism 7\u00ae.Fluorescence IHCIHC was performed as previously described. Briefly, 5\u03bcm thick paraffin-embedded sections of tumor tissue excised from GemOE orthotopic mammary tumors were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in PBS. Antigen retrieval for all antibodies was done using Sodium citrate buffer (10\u2009mM Sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0), 10\u2009min at 95\u2009\u00b0C. Slides were blocked with 10% normal serum (2\u00b0 antibody species) for 1\u2009h at RT, washed, and probed with 1\u00b0 antibodies overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Slides were exposed to Alexa Fluor 568 (red), and 488 (green) conjugated secondary antibody for 1\u2009h at RT and counterstained and mounted with VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (Vector) and imaged under the fluorescence microscope.Overall survival (OS) and replace-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) analysisThe association of geminin alone or combined with the other factors was investigated for stratified patient cohorts using overall (OS) and relapse/recurrent- (RFS), or distant metastasis- (MFS), or lung metastasis- (LMFS) -free survival using the PROGgeneV2 - Pan-Cancer Prognostics Database (http://watson.compbio.iupui.edu/chirayu/proggene/database) or the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.Statistical analysisComparisons of treatment outcomes were tested for statistical differences using the Student t-test for paired data. Additionally, SPSS software was used to perform the ANOVA test followed by a post hoc Bonferroni correction for comparing multiple groups. The association of mRNA transcript expression with various clinicopathological parameters was also analyzed. Statistical significance was assumed at a P-value are *\u22640.05, **\u22640.01 and ***\u22640.001.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationis available for this paper at 10.1038/s41598-019-55702-w.Author contributionsW. e.S. performed the in vivo experiments, analyzed all the data, interpreted all the data, and wrote the manuscript, D.R. performed some in vitro experiments, and J.K. performed statistical analysis.

        "content": "CXCL12 is positively associated with the metastasis and prognosis of various human malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the main cells secreting CXCL12, are capable of inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer cells. However, it has not been completely understood whether CXCL12 is involved in EMT of breast cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of CXCL12 on the EMT and cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotypes formation by transfecting pEGFP-N1-CXCL12 plasmid into MCF-7 cells. Real time-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated the successful over expression of CXCL12 in MCF-7 cells. Cell counting kit-8 assay, wound healing assay and Transwell invasion analysis confirmed that over expression of CXCL12 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells (P&lt;0.05). In addition, ALDH activity was dramatically enhanced compared with parental (P&lt;0.001), accompanied by the notably elevated mRNA and protein levels of OCT-4, Nanog, and SOX2 in CXCL12 overexpressed-MCF-7 cells (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, we observed the down regulation of E-cadherin and up regulation of vimentin, N-cadherin, and \u03b1-SMA in CXCL12 overexpressed-MCF-7 cells (P&lt;0.01). Meanwhile, western blot and immunofluorescence assay showed that over expression of CXCL12 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway to induce EMT of MCF-7 cells, as evidenced by the increased expression of E-cadherin after silencing \u03b2-catenin by siRNA interference (P&lt;0.001). Collectively, our findings suggested that over expression of CXCL12 could trigger EMT by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce CSC-like phenotypes formation to promote the proliferation and metastasis in MCF-7. Hence, CXCL12 may become a promising candidate for breast cancer therapy. ",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484).

The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively.

The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score.

Among different stromal cells, fibroblasts play pivotal roles in initiation and progression of epithelial tumors. During tumor progression, cancer cells secrete signaling molecules to recruit resident tissue fibroblasts and activate them. These cells, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the most abundant stromal cells in solid tumors and associate with cancer cells at all stages of tumor progression. Histopathological analysis of human tumors shows that advanced tumors with poor prognosis are abundant in CAFs. In breast cancer, CAFs and their ECM cause a tumor to be palpable. When epithelial cancer cells breach the basement membrane and invade the ECM, they come in direct contact with CAFs. Additionally, CAFs secrete various pro-invasive signaling molecules into the tumor microenvironment and deposit and remodel the ECM. Physical and biochemical interactions with CAFs and their associated ECM promote proliferation of cancer cells and alter their morphology to an invasive mesenchymal-like shape. Therefore, CAFs are a critical component of solid tumors and a key regulator of tumor-stromal interactions.Cell cultures and animal models are typically used to study tumor-stromal interactions. Culture of cancer cells and fibroblasts in an intermixed monolayer or in separated sheets provides a convenient method to study interactions between the two cell types. However, monolayer cultures do not reproduce complexities of tumors that are three-dimensional (3D), including oxygen and nutrients distribution profiles, cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, diffusive barrier to drug delivery, etc.. Mouse models provide physiological systems for cancer research but lack human tumor stroma and need complex biological assays and sophisticated imaging to study effects of stroma on tumor cells. To address the technological need for human tumor models, 3D cultures of cancer cells as spheroids have been developed. Spheroids are compact clusters of cells that reproduce properties of solid tumors such as diffusive transport of oxygen and nutrients, hypoxia and necrosis, drug delivery barriers, and deposition and degradation of ECM proteins. Co-culture spheroids of cancer cells with various stromal cells have been used to study tumor-stromal interactions that promote proliferation and drug resistance of breast cancer cells, and their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Despite their benefits, co-culture spheroids do not mimic the architecture of native solid tumors in terms of spatial distribution of cancer and stromal cells and cell-ECM interactions. Matrigel has been used to develop spheroid cultures to study cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions and ECM invasion of cancer cells. However, Matrigel is an animal-derived protein cocktail and not amenable to adjusting its composition and physicochemical properties. To gain control over spatial distribution of cells and ECM properties, microfluidics technology has been widely used to develop 3D tumor models. Recently, microfluidic co-culture systems containing hydrogel-based 3D matrices were used to study tumor-stromal interactions, cancer cell invasion of ECM, and anti-metastatic drug testing. Major drawbacks of microfluidic cell culture devices are their complexity and need for user expertise to develop and maintain them especially for long-term cultures, incompatibility with industrial-scale high throughput drug screening applications, and adsorption of drugs and proteins on the surface of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic devices.To overcome these limitations of existing cultures, we developed a 3D organotypic breast tumor model that resembles the architecture of avascular solid tumors and consists of three major components of the tumor microenvironment: mass of cancer cells, dispersed fibroblasts, and ECM. We also adapted this technology to a microwell plate format to enable convenient, reproducible formation of cultures, high throughput drug screening, and adaption by other users. To establish the validity of our model, we used triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling as a disease model. CXCL12, or stromal-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1), is a major paracrine signaling molecule produced by CAFs and signals through its cognate CXCR4 receptor often overexpressed on the surface of TNBC cells. Therefore, we use engineered CXCL12-secreting fibroblasts and CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells in our microtissues to recapitulate paracrine stromal-cancer cells signaling. Using different molecular analyses and imaging techniques, we demonstrated that CXCL12-secreting fibroblasts significantly contract the ECM. Additionally, signaling between the fibroblasts and TNBC cells promoted ECM invasion of cancer cells by activating oncogenic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We also demonstrated that blocking tumor-stromal interactions inhibits cancer cell invasiveness as a potential treatment strategy. This organotypic model is a convenient-to-adapt tool broadly useful to study different cancers. It offers straightforward implementation to facilitate dissemination to academic and industrial settings, allows adjusting added components including single to multiple cell types and ECM, and its compatibility with microwell plates uniquely enables high throughput drug testing against tumor-stromal interactions to identify novel therapeutics.Materials and MethodsCell cultureTwo different fibroblast cells were used: normal human mammary fibroblasts (gift of Dr. Daniel Hayes, University of Michigan) stably transduced with mCherry protein (labeled HMFs) and human mammary fibroblasts stably transduced to secrete 0.75 ng/ml/h of CXCL12\u03b1 fused with mCherry (labeled CXCL12+HMFs). MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells (purchased from the ATCC and labeled TNBC) overexpressing CXCR4 receptors (labeled CXCR4+TNBC) were transduced to stably express eGFP. These cells were generated in Dr. Luker\u2019s laboratory in University of Michigan. The authenticity of cells after stable transduction was verified by short tandem repeat profiling. Cells were tested for mycoplasma and maintained in Plasmocin prophylactic (Invivogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in a T75 flask (Thermo Fisher Scientific). When the cells were about 80% confluent, they were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma), dislodged using 0.25% trypsin (Life Technologies), and sub-cultured.Culture of fibroblasts in collagenFibroblast cells were harvested from a confluent monolayer and mixed with ice-cold collagen solution. Collagen solutions of desired concentrations were prepared from stock solutions of rat tail type I collagen (Corning) using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All the reagents were kept on ice during collagen preparation to prevent premature gelation of collagen. The pH of solutions was measured with a pH meter (Mettler Toledo) and maintained at 7.5 by adding 1 N NaOH or 1 N HCL dropwise. Of the stock collagen solution, 1 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml solutions were prepared and stored at 4\u00b0C for up to 1 h before use. The 1 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml collagen gels are referred to as softer and stiffer gels, respectively, for convenience. Different densities (number of cells per well) of HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs were used to study collagen contractility. For example, to form stiffer collagen gels with 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells in each well of a 384-well plate, 7.5 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were mixed with 1 ml of 4 mg/ml collagen solution, and 20 \u03bcl of the resulting suspension solution was dispensed into each well. Incubation at 37\u00b0C for 30 min resulted in hydrogel formation. Cultures were maintained in DMEM supplemented with only 1% FBS. Phase images were captured using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer A1, Zeiss). Contraction of collagen gels was quantified as a matrix contractility = (1 \u2013 ratio of projected area of a culture before and after contraction). Prior to this experiment, nanoindentation of collagen gels prepared from various concentration of 1.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.5, 7.0, and 8.5 mg/ml was conducted using an atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instruments). Plasma cleaning and UV radiation were performed on indentation probe and tip-holder to remove organic contaminants before each experiment. PBS buffer was used as a rehydrating medium for gels during indentation. We used 300 nm radius silicon-oxide probe with a cantilever spring constant of 0.06 N/m. Velocity of extension and recession of cantilever during indentation was controlled at 500 nm/s, slow enough to avoid hydrodynamic force from flow of buffer solution. A Poisson\u2019s ratio of 0.5 was used. At least 30 indentations were made on each sample to generate force versus indentation curves that were analyzed using the Hertz model to generate elastic modulus values for collagen gels of various protein concentrations.Spheroid formationCXCR4+TNBC spheroids were formed using our established protocol with an aqueous two-phase system. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Mw: 35 kDa, Sigma) and dextran (DEX) (Mw: 500 kDa, Pharmacosmos) were used to form 5.0% (w/v) aqueous PEG phase and 6.4% (w/v) aqueous DEX phase solutions in a complete growth medium. The PEG phase solution was supplemented with 0.24% of methylcellulose powder. CXCR4+TNBC cells were mixed thoroughly with the DEX phase solution to form a cell suspension with a density of 2.5\u00d7104 cells/\u03bcl. Next, 30 \u03bcl of the PEG solution was loaded into a round-bottom, ultralow attachment 384-well plate (Corning) labeled as the destination plate. A robotic liquid handler (SRT Bravo, Agilent Technologies) was used to dispense a 0.3 \u03bcl drop of the DEX phase containing 7.5\u00d7103 cells into each well of the destination plate. This process was done column-by-column to reduce the need for large volumes of high-density cell suspensions. The plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h to allow formation of a spheroid in the DEX phase drop within each microwell.Immunofluorescence of 3D cultures of dispersed fibroblastsAfter 5 days of incubating collagen gels containing only fibroblasts (1.5 \u00d7104 cells), cultures were transferred from the microwells into a Petri dish using a micro-spatula (Fine Science Tools). The gels were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS, each time for 10 min. The gels were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% goat serum. Cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were incubated overnight with a mouse anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (1:200 dilution, Abcam, Cat. No. ab6276) prepared in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Gels were washed and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h followed by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged at 60x with a confocal microscope (Nikon A1). FITC was excited by a 488 nm laser and the emission isolated with a 500\u2013550 nm filter, while Hoechst was excited by 405 nm and isolated with a 425\u2013475 nm emission filter.Metabolic activity of fibroblast cells in 3D culturesHMFs and CXCL12+HMFs were included toin separate collagen solutions in a 384-well plate at a density of 1.5 \u00d7104 cells per well. The collagen solutions were gelled and then medium with 1% FBS was added. The growth of the fibroblasts in collagen was evaluated for 2 weeks using a standard Prestoblue metabolic activity assay (Invitrogen). After 15 min of incubation, the fluorescent signal was measured with a standard plate reader (Synergy H1M, BioTek Instruments) at 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission wavelengths. Collagen gels without fibroblasts were used as a negative control.Conditioned medium culturesCXCL12+HMFs cells were seeded in a flask containing medium with 1% FBS. Conditioned medium was collected from a confluent monolayer of the CXCL12+HMFs and added to a culture of HMFs in 3D collagen gels every other day by replacing 60 \u03bcl of existing medium. Contraction of ECM was quantified using phase contrast images.Wound healing assayBoth HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs were seeded as a monolayer culture in 35 mm Petri dishes (Corning) and cultured until confluent. Using a pipette tip, a straight scratch was made in the cell layer. Cells were imaged for 48 h and the migration of cells in the cultures was quantified as gap closure=, where A1 was the initial gap area and A2 was the final gap area.Organotypic Microtissue formation, ECM invasion, and AMD3100 treatmentAfter formation of compact spheroids, medium was robotically removed from the wells. The protocol was optimized to ensure that spheroids remained in the wells during aspiration. This was done by adjusting the height of the pipette tip from the bottom of each well to 0.2 mm, maintaining a low aspiration rate of 0.6 \u03bcl/sec, and offsetting the position of the pipette tip 30% from the center of the well where spheroids were located. Cold collagen solution containing 1.5\u00d7104 fibroblasts (HMFs or CXCL12+HMFs) was dispensed into each well containing a spheroid. The well plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to form a collagen gel and then 60 \u03bcl of medium containing only 1% FBS was added (Fig. 1A). For convenience, microtissues containing HMFs or CXCL12+HMFs are labelled +HMFs and +CXCL12+HMFs, respectively. As a negative control, microtissues without fibroblasts were generated by adding the collagen solution to wells containing a cancer cell spheroid. Medium was refreshed every 72 hrs. Both aspirating and dispensing of collagen solution and medium were carried out robotically for accuracy and speed of sample preparation. Confocal images were taken with a 10x objective on days 1, 3, and 5 to assess matrix invasion of cancer cells. A 488 nm laser was used to excite the fluorophore, while a 500\u2013550 nm filter was used to capture eGFP fluorescence from CXCR4+TNBC cells. Z-stacks were constructed from images of samples acquired with a z-spacing of 20 \u03bcm. NIS software was used for image acquisition and Fiji (ImageJ, NIH) was used for analysis and 3D reconstruction. CXCR4+TNBC cell invasion of the ECM was quantified by analyzing images from both z-projected images and from the individual images of each z-stack.ECM invasion of cells was analyzed in two different ways. First, all the confocal images from each sample were collapsed to form a z-projected image. This image was opened in ImageJ and the scale was removed to set the scale to pixels and measure area in pixels. Then, color thresholding was used to select the area covered by the cells, and pixel areas were measured to quantify invasion area. Because this commonly-used method masks vertical displacement of cells, the vertical scattering of cancer cells was also analyzed. Briefly, each image from a stack of the confocal images was analyzed to measure the pixel area occupied by the CXCR4+TNBC cells. The area of pixels (labeled as invasion area) was then plotted against the z-distance of the images from each stack to obtain a histogram. Each microtissue resulted in one histogram and each data point in the histogram represented pixels area from one image. Area under the curve (AUC) was measured from each histogram in MATLAB (MathWorks). AUC values were averaged to express as 3D invasion cell area.Because dispersed fibroblasts contracted the collagen matrix, the contractility of the matrix in each microtissue containing a cancer cell spheroid and fibroblasts was expressed between 0 \u2013 1, with 1 being the highest matrix contraction. Then, ECM invasion of the CXCR4+TNBC cells was normalized with contractility and expressed as normalized invasion cell area=* invasion cell area. To block signaling from CXCL12+HMFs to CXCR4+TNBC cells, microtissues were treated with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100. Medium change was done every other day using 40 \u03bcl of fresh medium containing AMD3100. ECM invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells was imaged using a confocal microscope and analyzed as above.Western blottingMicrotissues were treated with collagenase I (Sigma) for about 10 min with added mechanical agitation by pipetting to dissociate and dissolve the matrix. Collagenase activity was neutralized by adding triple amounts of complete growth medium using the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer containing 1% protease inhibitors and 1% phosphatase inhibitors. The suspension was further sonicated twice at a 20% amplitude for 5 sec (Vibra-Cell, Sonics). A BCA protein quantification assay (Life Technologies) was used to measure total protein concentration from the samples, of which 25 \u03bcl was loaded onto a 4\u201315% gel (Bio-rad) for electrophoresis. The gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk prepared in wash buffer for 1 h, and incubated overnight with a primary antibody. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-phospho-Myosin Light Chain 2 (Thr18/Ser19) antibody (Cat. No. 3674), rabbit anti-Myosin Light Chain 2 antibody (Cat. No. 3672), rabbit anti-phospho-PI3K antibody (Cat. No. 4228), rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (p-Erk1/2) antibody (Cat. No. 9101), rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) antibody (Cat. No. 9102), rabbit anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) antibody (Cat. No. 4060) and GAPDH antibody (Cat. No. 5174), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The membranes were washed and then incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat. No. 7074) for 1 h. Detection was carried out using ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) with FluorChem E imaging system (ProteinSimple).Statistical AnalysisData were first checked for normality using Anderson-Darling method in MINITAB. For normally distributed data, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparisons were used to compare means among three or more samples. Two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to compare two experimental groups. Normally distributed data from experiments were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Non-Gaussian distributed data were analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Values of p < 0.05 denoted statistical significance.ResultsFibroblasts contract the ECMTo reproduce solid breast tumors, we generated organotypic tumor models containing a CXCR4+TNBC cell mass within a collagen matrix with dispersed fibroblasts (HMFs or CXCL12+HMFs). After forming a compact CXCR4+TNBC spheroid using our ATPS technology, we aspirated the medium robotically, dispensed collagen solution containing fibroblasts to embed the spheroid in each well and incubated the plate to allow collagen to gel (Fig. 1A). Prior to this, we also performed nanoindentation of collagen gels to determine the elastic modulus value of the collagen gel to match that of breast tumor tissues (Fig. S1A-B). Fig. 1B shows a 3D reconstructed volume view of the microtissue where a spheroid of CXCR4+TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231; blue) is surrounded by fibroblasts (green) dispersed in the collagen gel.We observed that the cultures detached from walls of microwells and shrank over time. To understand this phenomenon, we created microtissues of collagen-embedded CXCR4+TNBC spheroids only or collagen-embedded dispersed fibroblasts only. Cultures containing only CXCR4+TNBC spheroids in collagen did not shrink the gel even after two weeks of culture, whereas both HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs contracted the collagen gel time-dependently. To quantitatively study contraction of the ECM by fibroblasts, we used known numbers of fibroblast cells in collagen gels of two different protein concentrations. We first examined the spatial distribution of fibroblasts in collagen and consistency of preparation. Fibroblasts were uniformity distributed in the 3D space and the number of cells included closely matched the number of cells quantified from the confocal images (Fig. 2A-B). Next, we captured phase images of the cultures and quantified ECM contraction over time. This study considered effects of collagen gel elastic modulus, fibroblast cell density, and fibroblast type (HMFs or CXCL12+HMFs) (Fig. 2C-G).We found that with the softer ECM, the effect of fibroblast cell density was minimal and by day 4, the ECM shrank by 75\u201388% with HMFs and 88\u201394% with CXCL12+HMFs (Fig. 2E-F). The stiffer ECM showed significantly less contraction than the softer ECM for a given cell density. For example, on day 4 and with 1\u00d7104 HMFs, the stiffer ECM showed only 10% contraction, whereas the softer ECM had 87% contraction. With both fibroblasts, there was a cell density-dependent contractility effect, and larger cell densities caused a greater ECM contraction. For example, with the stiffer ECM on day 10, increasing the density of HMFs from 5\u00d7103 to 1.5\u00d7104 cells increased ECM contraction from 41% to 66%. Increasing density of CXCL12+HMFs in this range increased ECM contraction from 52% to 85%. CXCL12+HMFs more significantly contracted the ECM than HMFs at all cell densities used, and this effect was more pronounced with the stiffer ECM. For example, with a similar 1\u00d7104 cell density and on day 10, CXCL12+HMFs caused 78% ECM contraction compared to 56% with HMFs. Fig. 2G statistically compares ECM contraction by CXCL12+HMFs and HMFs at the largest cell density used. This analysis used for different cell densities showed that CXCL12+HMFs always generate significantly greater matrix contraction than HMFs (p<0.05).Mechanism of ECM Contraction by FibroblastsConsistent with our results, fibroblasts in human tumor stroma show ECM remodeling ability and increased contractility. To determine whether potential morphological differences between HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs contribute to their ability to generate force and contract the ECM, we conducted whole gel immunofluorescence of fibroblasts stained with \u03b2-actin and Hoechst. Confocal imaging showed that unlike HMFs, CXCL12+HMFs had a spindle-like, elongated morphology (Fig. 3A). CXCL12+HMFs had a five-fold higher cell aspect ratio than HMFs (Fig. 3B).To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we evaluated activity of myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) protein that regulates actomyosin contractility and cell polarity. CXCL12+HMFs had 1.40-fold higher p-MLC2/MLC2 than HMFs (Fig. 3C-D). This was also consistent with the significantly higher motility (Fig. S2A-B) and RhoA and ROCK I activity (Fig. S2C) in CXCL12+HMFs than HMFs. Using a ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, fully blocked collagen contraction by both fibroblasts (Fig. S2D), establishing the RhoA/ROCK/MLC2 signaling as a major mechanism of collagen contraction by fibroblasts. Both fibroblasts dispersed in collagen had a similar level of metabolic activity, indicating that the difference in their contractility was not due to potential differences in their proliferation in culture (Fig. S3). Additionally, supplementing CXCL12-conditioned medium to HMFs did not make these cells more contractile (Fig. S4), negating a role for this chemokine in fibroblast cell contractility. Overall, activities of the signaling molecules that regulate cell-ECM mechnaotransduction support the greater contractility of CXCL12+HMFs than HMFs in the organotypic tumor model.The role of fibroblasts in matrix invasion of cancer cellsNext, we studied the role of fibroblasts on CXCR4+TNBC cell invasion of ECM in the organotypic cultures. We used collagen-embedded CXCR4+TNBC cell mass as a negative control to evaluate how HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs regulate breast cancer cell invasiveness. In the absence of fibroblasts, CXCR4+TNBC cells invaded the ECM and showed astral-like protrusions from the spheroid (Fig. 4A). CXCR4+TNBC cells showed contrasting behaviors when cultured with different fibroblasts. While CXCL12+HMFs promoted a significant ECM invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells, HMFs suppressed CXCR4+TNBC cell invasiveness (Fig. 4A). To quantitatively compare cancer cell invasion of ECM among the three models, we normalized the invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells of each model on a measurement day by its matrix contractility (Fig. 4B). This compensated the effect of ECM contraction on masking the invasion distance of cancer cells. Cancer cell spheroids in the three models showed a similar morphology after 24 h of incubation. However, significant differences emerged after 3 days. CXCR4+TNBC cells in the model containing CXCL12+HMFs showed a significantly more invasion than the other two models containing HMFs or without any fibroblasts. With CXCL12+HMFs, invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells was 2.70-fold higher than that with HMFs, and 1.30-fold higher than that without fibroblasts (Fig. 4C). Maintaining the cultures for 5 days increased these differences to 4.0-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively.To develop a holistic view of 3D distribution of invading CXCR4+TNBC cells in the three models, we quantified CXCR4+TNBC cell numbers in different imaging planes and constructed histograms of position of the cells along the z-axis (Fig. 5A, Fig. S5). On day 3, CXCR4+TNBC cells in models including CXCL12+HMFs or without fibroblasts showed similar invasion profiles and a larger number of cells that invaded a greater distance than the model with HMFs (Fig. 5A). Results from day 5 samples showed a striking difference in the distribution of invading cells between these models, which could not be captured from the commonly-used analysis of a collapsed z-stack of images. In the presence of CXCL12+HMFs, CXCR4+TNBC cells showed the most scattering along the z-direction, whereas HMFs significantly inhibited invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells. In the absence of fibroblasts, there was no significant difference in the travel distance of cancer cells in the z-direction from day 3 to day 5. To enable statistical comparison, we averaged the invasion results from each model that confirmed a significant increase in the ECM invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells from day 3 to day 5 only in the presence of CXCL12+HMFs (Fig. 5B).To identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells due to signaling with CXCL12+HMFs, we evaluated activities of several prominent protein kinases associated with tumor cell invasiveness. Results showed that ERK1/2 activity was significantly higher by 1.4-fold in microtissues containing CXCL12+HMFs than those with HMFs (Fig. 6A-B). In addition, we determined ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mono-cultures of only fibroblasts or TNBC spheroids in collagen gel. The active levels of ERK1/2 in both fibroblasts were comparable and even lower in TNBC spheroids. These results suggest that CXCL12 signaling with CXCR4+TNBC cells in the organotypic culture accounts for the increased ERK1/2 activity. We did not observe any significant difference in activities of p-AKT or p-PI3K between the two organotypic models (data not shown).Inhibition of ECM invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cellsWe treated the CXCL12+HMFs-containing microtissues with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100, which is a potent antagonist of CXCR4. We imaged the microtissues on days 1, 3, and 5 and used the z-projected images to investigate the effect of blocking CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on ECM invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells. Only after 24 h of incubation, the treatment significantly reduced ECM invasion of cancer cells (Fig. 7A-B). While cancer cell invasion of the matrix increased during culture without treatment, blocking CXCR4 signaling maintained the cancer cells as a minimally-invasive spheroid (Fig. 7A-B). Our molecular analysis showed that blocking CXCR4 signaling significantly reduced p-ERK1/2 levels in the CXCR4+TNBC:CXCL12+HMFs microtissue (Fig. 7C). These results further established the role of MAPK pathway in TNBC cell invasiveness and the potential of inhibiting tumor-stromal signaling as a therapeutic approach.DiscussionUnlike approaches using co-cultures or Matrigel to form 3D cultures, our high throughput organotypic tumor model both mimics the architecture of solid tumors and reproduces physical and biochemical properties of the stroma. As a proof of concept in this study, we used breast tissue fibroblasts as stromal cells and type I collagen as the primary component of ECM in breast tissue. To demonstrate feasibility of adjusting properties of the system, we developed tumor models that replicated elastic modulus of breast tumors. The 1 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml collagen matrices had elastic moduli of 0.96 and 2.53 kPa to mimic bimodal stiffness of human breast tumors. We also adjusted the cellular composition of the model to a 2:1 ratio of fibroblast:cancer cells to mimic advanced breast tumors that have a larger stromal content, which correlates with tumor progression and poorer prognosis.We observed significant contraction of the collagen matrix as early as 48 h after forming the models. This ECM contraction was solely due to the dispersed fibroblasts as a spheroid of CXCR4+TNBC cells did not shrink the matrix even after 2 weeks of culture. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the matrix contraction of fibroblasts when the culture contained or lacked tumor spheroids (data not shown). This is consistent with the known capability of fibroblasts to remodel the ECM in normal and pathological conditions such as wound healing, fibrosis, and cancer. We characterized ECM contraction as a function of density and type of the fibroblasts (HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs), and elastic modulus of collagen gel. Consistent with results from 3D contraction assays, our finding suggests that fibroblasts contract softer collagen hydrogels faster than stiffer ones, and that a greater density of fibroblasts expedites the process. More importantly, we found that CXCL12+HMFs contract the collagen matrix more significantly than their normal counterparts, regardless of cell density or elastic modulus of the matrix. We verified that the two fibroblasts in the organotypic model have similar proliferation rates (Fig. S3), excluding the possibility of potential differences in their proliferative activities causing the difference in their contractility.Previous studies showed that activated fibroblasts, known as myofibroblasts, enhance contraction of collagen lattices and feature elongated morphology with stress fibers. In addition, myofibroblastic stromal cells derived from diseased fibrotic tissue have enhanced collagen contraction than stromal cells derived from normal tissue. We hypothesized that CXCL12+HMFs may exhibit myofibroblastic morphology responsible for their higher ECM contraction than HMFs. Indeed, CXCL12+HMFs dispersed in collagen hydrogels had an elongated morphology compared to HMFs that showed a branching morphology (Fig. 3A). Seeding the fibroblasts on the surface of collagen gels also reproduced this morphological difference (Fig. S6A). Additionally, the clear difference in the morphology of these two fibroblasts persisted at the same contractile time point. That is, CXCL12+HMFs on day 13 and HMFs on day 4 had a similar matrix contractility of about 0.75 (Fig. 2G) but displayed drastically different morphologies (Fig. S6B). Consistent with this finding, CXCL12+HMFs were more migratory than HMFs in a wound healing assay (Fig. S2A-B). Our molecular analysis showed that CXCL12+HMFs dispersed in collagen gels have a significantly greater cell-matrix mechanotransduction activity than HMFs, i.e., higher levels of contractility-associated proteins in the RhoA/ROCK I/MLC2 pathway (Fig. 3C-D & Fig. S2C). This is consistent with studies that show CAFs generate actomyosin-mediated contraction and remodel ECM through this pathway. These results suggest that the different morphologies of HMFs and CXCL12+HMFs are inherent properties of the cells.To validate the biological relevance of our organotypic tumor model, we investigated the effect of CXCL12-producing fibroblasts on matrix invasion of breast cancer cells by focusing on the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling axis. Among different soluble signaling molecules of CAFs, CXCL12 is a prominent chemokine promoting invasion of cancer cells. CXCL12 enhanced invasiveness of CXCR4+TNBC cells significantly and by four-fold compared to HMFs that lacked this chemokine. It is important to note that we normalized invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells with matrix contractility that was quantified from 2D projected area of collagen gels. However, gels contract volumetrically. Considering volumetric contraction of the matrix would increase invasion of cancer cells in the model containing CXCL12+HMFs even more. For example, approximating the shapes of hydrogels and quantifying invasion of cancer cells in day 5 cultures using the volumetric approach resulted in eight-fold increase in the invasion of cancer cells in the model containing CXCL12+HMFs than that with HMFs. Overall, this is consistent with studies that showed increased cancer cell invasion in microenvironments enriched with CAFs, and that CAFs promote invasion and metastasis of tumor cells in vitro and in mouse models. We found this signaling converges on MAPK pathway and amplifies ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CXCR4+TNBC cells to mediate enhanced invasion of cancer cells, consistent with the established role of ERK in tumor cell migration and invasiveness. As a therapy strategy, we demonstrated that blocking CXCR4 leads to a significant reduction in ECM invasion of CXCR4+TNBC cells. This is a promising treatment strategy for TNBC disease because the lack of hormone receptors and low HER2 expression renders endocrine and targeted therapies not feasible.To further delineate the importance of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling in cancer cell invasion, we generated organotypic models containing parental TNBC cells and CXCL12+HMFs fibroblasts. Results showed minimal matrix invasion of parental TNBC cells on day 5 of cultures (Fig. S7). This is because parental TNBC cells do not express detectable levels of CXCR4 receptors, highlighting that invasiveness of breast cancer cells depends on both components of this signaling axis. It is important to recognize that in tumor microenvironments, there are temporally dynamic changes in the expression levels of signaling molecules as the disease progresses. That is, the expression of CXCR4 receptor may be induced due to the persistent presence of its chemokine ligand in tumor microenvironments. These changes often occur over several months to years, and capturing them with in vitro systems may not be readily feasible. In addition, in the organotypic CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs model that lacked CXCL12 to initiate CXCR4 signaling, invasion of cancer cells was significantly reduced and cancer cells remained confined to a spheroid (Fig. 4). This is consistent with studies that showed normal mammary fibroblasts limit and even reverse malignant transformation of breast epithelial cells, which restore their baso-apical polarity, secretion of a tissue-specific glycoprotein into the acinar lumens, and deposition of basement membrane. Normal fibroblasts were also shown to inhibit proliferation and invasion of malignant cells through processes including changes in ECM architecture and pro-inflammatory molecules. Elucidating inhibitory effects of normal fibroblasts on invasiveness of TNBC cells in our model requires further studies.Because co-culture spheroids are routinely used in cancer research, we aimed to compare the ECM invasion of cancer cells in our organotypic model with intermixed co-cultures of fibroblasts and cancer cells embedded in collagen. Results from intermixed co-cultures showed that cancer cells from both CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs and CXCR4+TNBC:CXCL12+HMFs co-cultures invaded the ECM without any significant difference (Fig. S8A-B). Consistent with incompatibility of cell adhesion molecules of fibroblasts and cancer cells, our previous study showed that the fibroblasts and CXCR4+TNBC cells segregate from an intermixed spheroid, and that this effect was greater with HMFs than with CXCL12+HMFs. Considering that intermixed co-cultures do not mimic the architecture of solid tumors in terms of spatial distribution of cancer and stromal cells, our results suggest that their use for cancer cell invasion studies can lead to misleading information.Overall, this study underscores the value of our organotypic model that reproduces spatial positioning of cells in solid tumors where cancer cells are bordered by stroma containing dispersed CAFs. The modularity of our model allows convenient compositional adjustments, including addition of other stromal cells such as immune and endothelial cells and adjusting physicochemical properties of the ECM by supplementing various ECM elements of tumor microenvironment such as hyaluronan and fibronectin or using functionalized synthetic matrices. The compatibility of our model with microwell plates enables high throughput testing of chemical compounds using off-the-shelf robotic liquid handling tools for cancer drug discovery applications.ConclusionsWe developed high throughput organotypic tumor microtissues that mimic the structure and composition of solid breast tumors and reproduce dynamic interactions between breast cancer and stromal cells in presence of a natural ECM. This model allowed us to mechanistically study the role of fibroblasts in contraction of collagen matrix and invasiveness of TNBC cells. We demonstrated that both components of the CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 tumor-stromal signaling are required to promote ECM invasion of TNBC cells through oncogenic MAPK pathway. We showed that blocking tumor-stromal signaling using a targeted therapeutic molecule may be used as a therapy strategy to inhibit matrix invasion of breast cancer cells. This convenient-to-use and scalable tumor model offers a great potential to study tumor-stromal interactions and as a drug discovery tool in compound screening applications.Supplementary MaterialData AvailabilityThe data required to reproduce these findings, both raw and processed, is available upon request.Conflicts of InterestAuthors declare no conflict of interest.This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

IntroductionBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Clinically, breast cancers are categorized into four subtypes based on their intrinsic characteristics of cancer cells to facilitate targeted therapy. Immunohistochemical determinations of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67 status are used to categorize these tumors. In accordance with the more recent criteria, breast cancers are classified as: (1) luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative); (2) luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%); (3) HER2-enriched (HER2 amplified, ER- and PR-negative); and (4) triple-negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative) subtypes.Prognosis and survival are different depending on these subtypes. Luminal tumors, the most frequent (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses, while HER2-overexpressing and triple-negative tumors are associated with worst prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. For this reason, novel markers to improve prognosis and to decide therapeutic strategies are required.Tumors are complex tissues composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells, including cancer-cells and stromal cells. It is known that characteristics of stromal cells may dictate tumor outcome in breast cancer. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute the principal component of the tumor stroma. CAFs display a high proliferation rate and show capacity to facilitate tumor progression by degrading and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting an angiogenic shift, inducing a metabolic reprogramming toward a reverse Warburg phenotype, or stem cell trait achievement, compared with normal fibroblasts. CAFs promote these actions by the secretion of growth factors and cytokines that influence the epithelium behavior. In this context, CAFs can activate the NF\u03baB signaling pathway to evoke a pro-inflammatory response, and through the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and SDF-1, induce the recruitment of immune cells.In the present study, we have investigated the gene expression of 19 factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas, and their variation after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Those factors were: the calcium-binding protein S100A4, several growth factors (FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, and IGF2), and we also studied inflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL8), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL12), important proteases (uPA, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP11), the nuclear factor NF\u03baB, and the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP1.2. Material and Methods2.1. Patient Selection and Their Characteristics, and Tissue Specimen Handling This study is a non-randomized prospective research which includes 19 women with a histological confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma of luminal type. We selected consecutive cases of T1 or T2 invasive ductal carcinoma of luminal type with sufficient tissue for cell culture, during the period between July 2011 and August 2013, who underwent for a tumor resection as their first therapeutic approach. The exclusion criteria were: prior history of malignant tumor, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, uterine cervix cancer in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of breast cancer, and a history of having received any type of therapy prior to surgery. Table 1 shows characteristics of the 19 patients with invasive breast carcinoma, all included in the analyses performed in this study and classified as luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative) or luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%).During the follow-up period, a total of 6 patients developed distant metastases. The follow-up period was 43 months for patients with recurrence and 58 months for patients without. Women were treated according to the guidelines used in our Institution (Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove). Before the evaluation of tumor samples, all patients gave their written informed consent. The study adhered to National regulations and was approved by the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove Ethics and Investigation Committee.2.2. Cell LinesThe estrogen-independent human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, were both purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).The MCF-7 cell line was cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Lonza, Visp, Switzerland), and the MDA-MB-231 cell line was maintained in high glucose DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, North Darmouth, MA, USA) and the antibiotic mixture 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, Paisley, UK).2.3. Primary Cell Culture Tumor samples were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and enzymatically dissociated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Roche, Hertfordshire, UK) at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h.After enzymatic digestion, the suspension obtained was centrifuged at 400\u00d7 g for 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended and cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin (Gibco), 1 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 5 ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell cultures exhibited, predominantly, fibroblast morphology after three or four passages. Fibroblast culture purity was analyzed by flow-cytometry (Figure 1) using the antibody CD90 clone AS02 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) incubated at 1:50 (4 \u00b5g/mL) for 45 min. After, two washes with PBS 1X, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (FITC, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, ref.: 0103) for 30 min. CD90 clone AS02 antibody specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry before being used on study samples. Also, we analyzed the expression of CD34 (555822, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), which is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors as well as by a multitude of other non-hematopoietic cell types, including epithelial progenitors and vascular endothelial progenitors.2.4. Co-Culture ExperimentsTranswell 24-well plates were used to perform co-cultures of fibroblasts with breast cancer cell lines. Fibroblast cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 104 cells in the bottom of the wells, whereas breast cancer cell lines were seeded (2 \u00d7 104 cells) in the 0.24 \u03bcm pore size tissue culture inserts, which were introduced into the fibroblasts-containing wells later on. Cells were co-cultured for 72 h in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Then, RNA extraction was performed using the following protocol.2.5. Real Time-PCR \u201cRNeasy Mini Kit\u201d (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including the DNAse treatment was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for total RNA isolation. As described previously, the integrity and concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by using a NanoDrop Technologies device, (Wilmington, DE, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the \u201cTranscriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit\u201d (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reverse transcription step was carried out using the following program: firstly, an incubation at 65 \u00b0C during 10 min was performed to ensure denaturation of RNA secondary structures, and then, the reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, 60 min at 50 \u00b0C, and 5 min at 85 \u00b0C.Expressions of different factors were measured using RealTime ready custom panel plates (Roche). These custom-designed plates contained the specific primers and probes for the factors studied and for three reference genes (Table 2). The mRNA levels were measured in a LightCycler 480 II (Roche) with the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 s.The expression was quantified using advanced relative quantification. In this method, the crossing point (Cp) is automatically calculated using the LightCycler software as the first maximum of the second derivative of the curve. A combination of two housekeeping genes (\u03b2-actin and SDHA (Succinate dehydrogenase subunit A)) as a normalization factor was used to minimize sample variability and to increase the accuracy and resolution of gene expression normalization.2.6. ImmunohistochemistryTo study the protein expression of IGF2, immunohistochemistry staining was performed on tissue sections of breast cancer using a TechMate TM50 autostainer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), a primary antibody against IGF2 (ab9574, Abcam, antigen retrieval pH6, incubation 1 h) and the EnVision Detection kit (Dako). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol and permanently coverslipped, as previously described.2.7. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test was used to determine whether sample data were normally distributed. As data were normally distributed, comparison between groups was performed with the Student\u2019s t test. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Differences were considered significant when the p-value \u2264 0.05. The PASW Statistics program was used for all calculations.3. Results3.1. Molecular Profile of CAFsWe determined whether CAFs from luminal tumors presented phenotypic variability at their basal expression of several genes implicated in tumor progression (S100A4, FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, IGF2, IL6, IL8, CCL2, CXCL12, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11, NF\u03baB, and TIMP1). CCL2 and MMP9 gene expressions were significantly higher in CAFs from luminal B tumors compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively, Figure 2). However, we found no significant differences in other pro-tumoral factors between CAFs from these two tumor subtypes.3.2. Molecular Profile of CAFs Co-Culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cell LinesWe next examined the effect of breast tumor cell lines over different CAFs from luminal A or luminal B subtypes. We found different patterns in the expression of pro-tumoral factors depending on the CAF\u2019s luminal type co-cultured with the different cancer cell lines. CAFs from luminal A tumors co-cultured with the luminal cell line MCF-7, showed an increase in VEGFA levels (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A), but a decrease in the gene expression of HGF (p = 0.028), CCL2 (p = 0.028), NF\u03baB (p = 0.046), and MMP-9 (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A). CAFs from luminal B tumors co-cultured with MCF-7 showed a decrease in CCL2 (p = 0.003) and NF\u03baB (p = 0.009) gene expression, while they showed an increased gene expression of other important pro-tumoral factors such as TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.007), CXCL12 (p = 0.013), MMP-2 (p = 0.039) and VEGF A (p = 0.003) (Figure 3B). When CAFs were co-cultured with the triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell line, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increased gene expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA (p = 0.028, for both) (Figure 3C), whereas CAFs from luminal B tumors showed an increased expression in VEGFA (p = 0.003), S100A4 (p = 0.019), TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.004), IL6 (p = 0.049), and IL8 (p = 0.009), but a decrease of NF\u03baB expression (p = 0.028) (Figure 3D). All together, these data suggest that CAFs from luminal B tumors showed, globally, a higher gene expression profile of stromal pro-tumoral factors when co-cultured with any one of these two breast cancer cell lines.3.3. Relationship between CAFs\u2019 Molecular Profile and Development of Distant MetastasisWe also compared the relapse-free survival period with the basal molecular profiling of CAFs. Six patients developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period: two patients with luminal A tumors and four with luminal B tumors. Then, we re-analyzed the gene expression of CAFs comparing those patients developing metastasis with the rest of patients. Interestingly, we found that high IGF2 gene expression (>median) in CAFs was significantly associated with a shortened relapse-free survival (Figure 4A). In addition, higher basal IGF2 gene expression was found in CAFs from metastasic tumors than in CAFs from non-metastasic tumors in all luminal tumors (Figure 4B), and especially, in luminal B tumors (Figure 4C). No significant data was obtained for luminal A tumors due to the low recurrence rate in this population and the small sample size. Finally, we also observed that higher IGF2 gene expression in CAFs from metastatic tumors remained increased after co-culture with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4D,E).In order to confirm the protein expression of IGF2, we stained primary tumors tissue sections and observed the expression by fibroblast (Figure 5). However, we could not analyze all samples (no access to tissue block for all patients) and therefore we could not establish its concordance to metastasis development.4. DiscussionToday, breast tumors are categorized based on cancer cell characteristics for their management. Four main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, HER2\u2212enriched and basal-like) have been established over the last 15 years. Each of these subtypes has different features, clinical behaviors, and treatment response profiles. Luminal tumors, the most frequent type (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. Our results indicate that CAFs from luminal B tumors show more pro-tumor characteristics compared with CAFs from luminal A tumors, which provide evidence of a possible contribution of the stroma to the different biological and clinical behavior between these tumors. Luminal A breast cancers are associated with a most favorable short-term prognosis due to its positive response to endocrine therapy. Luminal B tumors are recognized to have a more aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable prognosis compared with luminal A tumors. In fact, many of the luminal B tumors are ER+/HER2\u2212/high Ki-67. However, expression profiles also classify the ER+/HER2+ tumors as luminal B, and these patients receive a different therapy regimen (that incorporates targeted anti-HER2 therapy) compared to other luminal B breast cancer. In addition, according to the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus, the diagnosis of a portion of patients with the luminal A subtype with poor prognosis was changed to the luminal B subtype, which was determined based on ER positivity, HER2 negativity, Ki67 expression > 14%, and PgR expression < 20%. Thus, luminal B breast tumors (that accounted for nearly 40% of all breast cancers) constitute the most heterogeneous molecular subtype at the clinical and molecular levels. Unfortunately, the immunohistochemistry of the luminal B subtype, based on intrinsic genetics characteristics from cancer cells, remains poorly defined, and it has now become a paramount importance to find new markers capable of segregating luminal tumors into clinically meaningful subgroups that may be used clinically to guide patient management. With this in mind, in the present study, we have tried to identify CAFs populations differing in their pro-tumor capabilities in these luminal tumors.In the present study, we found variability in the gene expression of factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas (Table 1), and after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, depending whether those CAFs are from luminal A or B tumors. CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher gene expression of MMP-9 and CCL2 compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors. These findings are relevant if we consider that MMP-9 (also known as Gelatinase B) is related to tumor invasion and metastasis by its capacity to degrade the type IV collagen found in basement membranes, and to induce angiogenesis. Likewise, MMP-9 has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and/or poor prognostic in patients with breast cancer. On the other hand, CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP1) is a chemokine that exerts a potent chemotactic, stimulatory, and mitogenic effects on mononuclear cells. High levels of CCL2 in the tumor microenvironment, as well as high circulating concentrations of this chemokine, have been associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma patients. CCL2 also stimulates the migration of mammary carcinoma cell lines, and mediates the recruitment of specific monocyte populations that support the establishment of metastatic disease.Especially relevant were our findings showing that different CAFs populations differentially expressed pro-tumor factors depending on co-cultured cancer cell lines. Thus, after co-culture with the luminal cell line MCF-7, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increase in VEGFA levels, but a decreased expression levels of other pro-tumor genes (HGF, CCL2, NF\u03baB, and MMP-9) while CAFs from luminal B tumors although showed decreased levels of CCL2 and NF\u03baB gene expression, but increased gene expression of other important pro-tumor factors like TGF\u03b2, CXCXL12, MMP-2, and VEGF A. Likewise, different patterns of gene expression were found in CAFs from Luminal A tumors, with increased expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA, or CAFs from luminal B tumors, with increased levels of VEGFA, S100A4, TGF\u03b2, IL6, and IL8, but decreased levels of NF\u03baB, after being co-cultured with the cell line MDA-MB-321.In general, CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher expression of pro-tumor factors when co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines, which is in accordance with the fact that these tumors are associated with higher tumor aggressiveness. These overexpressed factors are of importance promoting several biological aspects of tumor progression. TGF\u03b2 is a well-known cytokine that induces malignant mammary epithelial cell to undergo EMT, leading to the acquisition of highly migratory, invasive and metastatic phenotypes. It has been also described that TGF\u03b2 can induce the expression of different proteins, such as growth factors, cytokines, and ECM proteins in CAFs, which promote tumor development in the adjacent epithelium. CXCL12 is a highly pleiotropic chemokine, influencing a variety of biological processes through the interaction with its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7. CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 signaling has been shown to play a role in tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis and bone marrow cell recruitment. In line with this, it has been demonstrated that co-implantation of tumor cells with fibroblasts expressing CXCL12 enhances tumor growth and CXCL12 overexpression has been linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, a number of different agents have been used to block the CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 interaction to inhibit metastasis.MMP-2 (Gelatinase A) together with MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) are related to tumor invasion and metastasis by their special capacity to degrade type IV collagen in basement membrane, and to induce angiogenesis. MMP-2 production increased during the early phase of breast cancer, but also high levels of MMP-2 have been related to poor outcome in breast carcinomas. VEGFA is a potent regulator of angiogenesis and thereby involved in the development and progression of solid tumors, such as breast cancer. S100A4, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein superfamily, has been described as a key player in promoting metastasis, acting as an angiogenic factor, inducing cell motility, and increasing the expression of MMPs. In fact, elevated levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 have been associated with poor patient survival in breast cancer patients and to induce metastasis in rodent models.Interestingly, we have observed high expression levels of IL6 and IL8 in CAFs from luminal B tumors after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells. Previous reports showed that both cytokines are important to maintain the aggressiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly tumorigenic cell line which appears to be devoid of stemness-related features. In addition, clinical studies have showed that both high levels of IL-6 or IL-8 have been associated with breast cancer recurrence. In addition, several strategies to disrupt IL-6 signaling or IL-8 signaling, in vitro or in vivo, significantly reduce tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer cells.Together, these gene expression data may to contribute to a better characterization of tumor stroma of luminal breast carcinomas.Finally, we reclassified the CAFs gene expression analysis considering patients developing or not distant metastasis during the follow-up period. An obvious limitation of the present study is the reduced number of patients who developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period. Nevertheless, and interestingly enough, we have observed that CAFs from metastatic luminal tumors had the highest IGF-2 gene expression, either in basal levels or after being co-cultured with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell lines. These findings seem to be in agreement with previous data revealing that IGF2, which is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of human cancers, is associated with more aggressive tumors and with a poor prognosis. IGF-2 promotes excessive growth and anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. In fact, it has been shown that IGF-2 signaling is important to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In addition, IGF-2 has been recently implicated in a positive feedback circuit as a critical mechanism to increase stemness and maintain breast cancer cells. More importantly, it has been suggested that CAFs derived from breast metastatic tumors have increased protumorogenic properties due to the increased expression of IGF2. On the other hand, there are several lines of evidence linking IGF signaling and luminal tumors. In one large follow-up study on breast cancer in postmenopausal women, serum levels of IGF-2, but not IGF-1, were positively associated with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer risk. Likewise, it has been reported that both the co-expression and interactions of IGF1R (receptor for IGF-1 and IGF-2) and ER signaling systems suggest a role for the IGF1R network in the resistance to endocrine therapy. It is also remarkable that IGF-2 is known to play an important role during fetal growth and development, and its expression in malignant tumors might implicate a more primitive cellular phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that IGF-2 expression may be a potential useful marker of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in luminal tumors.In summary, our data may contribute to a better biological characterization of the interaction between cancer cells and tumor stroma in luminal breast carcinomas. In this way, our results allow us to consider that, among the complex array of soluble factors produced by CAFs, it could arise possible new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for luminal breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization: N.E., M.F., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Data curation: N.E., M.F., J.R.C., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Formal analysis: N.O., S.C., M.F., and L.O.G.; Investigation: N.E., S.C., and M.F.; Methodology: N.E. and S.C.; Project administration: N.E. and F.J.V.; Resources: L.O.G. and F.J.V.; Writing\u2014original draft: N.E., S.C., M.F., and F.J.V; Writing\u2014review & editing: N.E., J.R.C., and F.J.V.

        "content": "The lack of targeted therapy for women with triple negative breast cancer demands a \"think-outside-the-box\" approach in search of novel treatment strategies. Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a special focus on FAP(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the \"generic\" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.",

Chemotherapy is one of the cornerstone treatments in patients with breast cancer, which overall improves breast cancer outcome by 5\u201310% in patients with node negative disease. However, its use is increasingly affected by chemotherapy resistance and lack of effective predictors. Recently, emerging evidences have suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. As the most frequent component of stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, CAFs have been assumed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of breast cancer. Moreover, Farmer et al. reported that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), suggesting that stroma activation could be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, it was shown that CAFs mediated resistance to chemotherapy by releasing collagen I. Loeffler et al. have developed a vaccine that could target CAFs and allow reversing resistance to chemotherapy.Considering the interaction between CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, it would be reasonable that chemotherapy-induced damage could have an impact on CAFs and change the expression of some relevant factors, which could participate in chemotherapy resistance. In our study, we have cultured CAFs which were derived from surgically resected primary breast cancers and compared the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy. The goal will be to find candidate markers from tumor microenvironment that associate with breast cancer chemotherapy resistance and discuss the possibility that these markers could be used as predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and feasible for targeted therapy.Materials and Methods1. Ethics StatementThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent for using the samples for research purposes was obtained from all patients prior to surgery.2. Cell Culture of CAFs and Breast Cancer Cell LineTissues for primary cultures of CAFs were collected from 10 breast cancer patients who underwent complete surgical resection of their tumors at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Only tissues in excess of those required for clinical diagnoses were harvested for this study. Harvested tissues were placed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen Corporation) for immediate transportation on ice to the laboratory. Tissues were minced into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and digested for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in prepared reagent containing collagenase type I and Hyaluronidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension was filtrated with 100 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then the pellet was resuspended in the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell counting was performed with the Beckman Coulter Cell and Particle Counter Z1. The population doubling was estimated based on the increase in cell number counted at each passage time. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the breast cancer cell line, according to the normal procedure (Sigma-Aldrich).3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Primary antibodies for immunostaining included multi-cytokeratin (CK), Vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD34, and TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) (Labvision). CAFs were seeded in chamber slides and fixed in cold acetone. After antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature in a moist chamber for 60 min. Specific signals were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with 3,3/-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as a chromogen to create brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min, and the slides were coverslipped.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM)CAFs were collected and prepared as a single cell suspension by mechanical blowing with PBS at the concentration of 1\u00d7105/ml. The expression of CD34 and CD45 (MACS) was detected using FCM (FACSC alibar; BD).5. Cell Adhesion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber (Transwell; Corning). For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere (Sanofi). Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, until confluent. Matrigel (BD) was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and then 100 \u00b5l matrigel was added to each well in new 24-well plates. Two groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and transferred to 24-well plates coated with matrigel. After incubation for 1 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of MDA-MB-231 cells that adhered to the bottom of coated wells was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.6. Invasion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. Matrigel was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and 50 \u00b5l/cm2 matrigel was added to each filter. The filters were placed in 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each upper chamber, and CAFs were added to the lower chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.7. Proliferation Assay (MTT)The harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were treated with 0 ng/ml, 4 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml Taxotere, respectively. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. Assays were initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l MTT (2 mg/ml) to each well and incubating the cells for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 1 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. Finally, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate, which were read at a wavelength of 550 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum.8. mRNA Expression ProfilingTotally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). Total RNA was extracted from all cultured CAFs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Microarray studies were performed by Capital Medical University Microarray Centre, using Illumina humanHT-12 v4 expression BeadChip based on Illumina BeadStation500. The biotinylated cRNA preparation, hybridization, and scanning of microarrays were done according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Biological replicates have been used to reduce errors. Illumina Gene Expression Beaderchips have internal control features to monitor data quality. The GenomeStudio software (Ilumina) calculates and reports a detection p-value, which determines whether a transcript on the array is called detected. In our study, a detection p-value below the threshold of 0.01 indicated that a gene could be considered as expressed. Differentially expressed genes in CAFs before chemotherapy vs. after chemotherapy were also identified and analyzed with GenomeStudio. The output was filtered to include genes whose expression was altered at least two-fold. The dataset of the microarray analysis has been deposited in ArrayExpress, with the accession number E-MTAB-1614.9. Real-Time PCRReal-Time PCR was performed to confirm differential gene expression in cultured CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h), using BIO-RAD IQ5 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u00b5g total RNA, oligo (dT), and Superscript\u2122 III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesis was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the primers were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for thecandidate genes. Predicted PCR product sequences were verified by using BLAST for recognition of target and non-target sequences.10. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). Student\u2019s t test was used to test for statistical significance. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1standard error. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.Results1. Characterization of Primary-cultured CAFsBy using a study protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board, CAFs were cultured from 10 surgically resected primary breast cancers which were histologically confirmed. The cultured cells were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. The morphological and immunohistochemical pictures of CAFs were represented in Figure 1A. Additionally, FCM showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs (Figure 1B).Characterization of primary-cultured CAFs.A showed the cultured cells which were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. B showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs with FCM.2. CAFs Promotes the Function of Breast Cancer Cells after ChemotherapyWe assumed that chemotherapy-induced damage interacted with tumor microenvironment and hence compared the function of MDA-MB-231 cells after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere) co-cultured with CAFs and that without CAFs. By using cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. The representative pictures of cell functional studies were shown in Figure 2.The function comparison of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, when treated with Taxotere.By using cell adhesion assay (A), invasion assay (B), and MTT assay (C), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with cells without co-culture.3. Comparison of Gene Expression Profiling in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyTotally 24314 expressed genes were detected in the microarray assay and 35 differentially expressed genes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between CAFs after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were summarized in Table S1 and Figure 3A with clustering analysis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed genes were also annotated in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion (hsa04510), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010).Hierarchical clustering of gene analysis expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere).A showed the Heatmap plot of scaled gene-expression levels. The first 6 columns marked with \u201c1\u201d on top have represented the samples untreated with Taxotere, while the following 6 columns marked with \u201c2\u201d have represented the samples treated with Taxotere. Rows are genes with mean fold change between CAFs before and after chemotherapy. B and C revealed that these genes including up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity through GO analysis.4. Differential Expression of Candidate Genes in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyWe have picked up 6 genes from 35 differential genes and confirmed the different gene expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) via Real-Time PCR, using triplicate samples. The candidate genes included up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The pictures were represented in Figure 4.Differential expression of candidate genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy.The candidate genes were picked up from 35 differential genes, including up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. The differential expression of 6 genes in three pairs of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05).DiscussionAs is known, cancer is a systemic disease encompassing multiple components of both tumor cells themselves and tumor microenvironment. The notion is now widely accepted that the development and progression of cancer highly depends on the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Recently, many investigations have pointed to stromal cells as the major regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancers. However, the origin of CAFs has been a debate. Based on different theories, CAFs might arise from activated resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or other undetermined mechanisms. Correspondingly, CAFs were reported to exhibit different expression of multiple biomarkers such \u03b1-SMA, FSP-1, FAP, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b2), vimentin, CAV-1, PTEN, p21, or TP53 mutation. According to our study, CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) and negative expression of CK, CD34, as well as CD45, suggesting that these primary-cultured CAFs were more likely to arise from activated resident fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cells, endothelial cells or bone marrow. We are aware that the observation based on morphological characteristics is just weak evidence for explaining the origin hypothesis, which needs further and more fundamental studies. Moreover, our data showed that CAFs could promote the adhesion, invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, which was consistent with peer researches.Breast cancer is known as the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been considered as an effective way which could improve the outcomes especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. However, the resistance of tumor cells to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs and lack of useful predictive markers of response to NAC continue to be problems. Though the precise nature and molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still unclear, many current studies have focused on identifying novel predictors of chemotherapy efficiency. CAFs merit attention, in consideration of frequent association with chemotherapy resistance. Sonnenberg et al. reported highly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in CAFs from lung and breast, which could explain some levels of resistance in stroma-positive tumors where stroma would not be sensitive to chemotherapy. Furthermore, an oral DNA vaccine targeting fibroblasts activation protein (FAP) was developed to suppress primary tumor cell growth and metastasis of multidrug-resistant murine breast carcinoma and allowed reversing resistance to chemotherapy, by increasing intratumoral drug uptake. Based on our data, the comparison of gene expression profiling between CAFs before and after chemotherapy indicated the solid gene changes and provided candidate markers that might participate in chemotherapy resistance. Considering the correlation of breast cancer treatment and tumor microenvironment (especially CAFs), we suppose that the genes about membrane protein and secreted factors will be likely to associate with chemotherapy resistance. Then we have looked through the relevant literatures, to evaluate the research status and prospect of these genes, and eventually chosen CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 as candidate genes. The differential expression of these genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed by RT-RCR (p<0.05), suggesting potential predictors of response to treatment.CXCL2 is one member of a family of structurally related chemokines, which are also called ELR-positive subgroup of CXC-chemokines. It was reported that CXCL2 could enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro and differential expression of CXCL2 in colon cancer had impact on metastatic disease and survival. In addition, CXCL2 was found to show significantly different expression in 5-FU responder and nonresponder breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its relationship with chemotherapy response. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 has been focused on, in view of the association between its five polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Moreover, the study carried out by Li et al. established the relationship between TP and MMPs in cancer cell invasion. Recently, the up-regulation expression of MMP1 was observed during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude mice, indicating potential targets involved in the control of metastasis. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was indicated to correlate with the growth and progression of tumors. Some interesting observations were made with regard to the prognostic role of baseline plasma IL8 protein levels in breast cancer patients treated with weekly docetaxel. Besides, Snoussi et al. pointed out that the polymorphisms in IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2 are associated with increased breast cancer risk and disease progress, implying that IL-8 and CXCR2 might contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis and aggressiveness. Lee et al. found that increased expression of IL-8 in the tumor microenvironment enhanced colon cancer growth and metastasis, which is very inspiring for our research. All the above markers including CXCL2, MMP1 and IL-8 were up-regulated based on our study, while FGF1, RARRES1 and CXCR7 as follows were down-regulated.As is known, breast cancer cells overexpress fibroblast growth factor receptors. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was reported to be especially suitable as chemotherapeutic drug carrier in light of its biological activity. Additionally, FGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR could efficiently decrease breast cancer cell viability, suggesting the possibility for targeted therapy. According to these data, it could be assumed that decreased expression of FGF1 might be involved in the chemotherapy resistance. Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is a retinoid regulated gene, which is accounted as a tumor suppress gene and lost in many cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that the down-regulation of RARRES1 is related to tumor growth of colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The investigation on the role of RARRES1 in the chemotherapy resistance is still rare, therefore its decreased expression in CAFs after chemotherapy caused our attention. CXCR7, as well as CXCR4, have been known as the receptors of chemokine CXCL12. Liberman et al. considered that CXCR7 would elicit anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma. Recently Hernandez et al. found that CXCR7 impaired invasion of breast cancer, in contrast to CXCR4. We propose that CXCR7 would contribute to the chemotherapy resistance in the condition of treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in the abovementioned candidate genes, CXCL2, MMP1 and IL8 are recognized as secretory-type genes, which possibly could be tested in serum in the form of genes or proteins. Its relationship with prognosis will be studied.Overall, in this study we have primarily cultured CAFs, compared its gene expression profiling before and after chemotherapy, and picked up 6 candidate genes which are possibly associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. We hope that our study might supply the potential predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and possible targets for treatment, which could provide the patient with optimal therapeutic management and better prognosis. For further study, the molecular mechanism of these candidate markers will continue to be researched to elucidate their relationship with chemotherapy resistance.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer statistics, 2012Effects of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for early breast cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the randomised trialsImplication of tumor microenvironment in the resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patientsStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionRoots and stems: stem cells in cancerA stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancerRole of extracellular matrix assembly in interstitial transport in solid tumorsTargeting tumor-associated fibroblasts improves cancer chemotherapy by increasing intratumoral drug uptakeTumor microenvironment and breast cancer progression: A complex scenarioFibroblasts in cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor growth-bystanders turning into key playersA fibroblast-associated antigen: characterization in fibroblasts and immunoreactivity in smooth muscle differentiated stromal cellsEpithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer can provide a nonmalignant stromaBone marrow contribution to tumor-associated myofibroblasts and fibroblastsAdipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factorsp53 Attenuates cancer cell migration and invasion through repression of SDF-1/CXCL12 expression in stromal fibroblastsExpression of p21waf1/Cip1 in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast tumorsPten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary epithelial tumoursCaveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblastsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisImpact, mechanisms, and novel chemotherapy strategies for overcoming resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes in metastatic breast cancerAdvances in neoadjuvant (primary) systemic therapy with cytotoxic agentsResearch issues affecting preoperative systemic therapy for operable breast cancer17p12 deletion in breast cancer predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapyBRCA1 protein levels and PIK3CA mutations as predictive biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: An exploratory analysisHighly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from lung and breastThe role of CXC chemokines and their receptors in cancerDifferential expression of the chemokines GRO-2, GRO-3, and interleukin-8 in colon cancer and their impact on metastatic disease and survivalCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCurrent evidence on the relationship between five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) gene and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysisIncreased Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases Mediates Thromboxane A2-Induced Invasion in Lung Cancer CellsProtein expression changes during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude miceIncreased expression of MMP-9 and IL-8 are correlated with poor prognosis of Bladder CancerInterleukin-8 secretion by ovarian cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasionExpression of Angiogenic Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Treated with Weekly DocetaxelCombined effects of IL-8 and CXCR2 gene polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility and aggressivenessInterleukin-8 and its receptor CXCR2 in the tumour microenvironment promote colon cancer growth, progression and metastasisFGF-1 as a possible carrier for targeted drug deliveryFGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR efficiently decrease cell viability upon NIR irradiationTazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicityRole of the RARRES1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinomaRARRES1 expression is significantly related to tumour differentiation and staging in colorectal adenocarcinomaInvolvement of the CXCR7/CXCR4/CXCL12 Axis in the Malignant Progression of Human NeuroblastomaOpposing roles of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer metastasis"

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4.

The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and bone marrow (BM) was immediately extracted and stained with primary anti-CD117-PE and anti-CD45-FITC antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Supplemental Figure S2. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed to assess differences in CD117+ cells within the total BM population.

Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and either formalin-fixed or snap-frozen. (a\u2013g) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and stained with (a\u2013c) hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or (e\u2013g) subjected to immunohistochemistry with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification for the presence of metastatic tumor cells (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a,e) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (b,f) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (c,g) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. (d) Positive control; MCF7 primary human breast tumor tissue. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels (a\u2013c) and top panels (d\u2013g) and high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels (a\u2013c) and bottom panels (d\u2013g). (h) DNA was isolated from snap-frozen lung tissue from tumor-na\u00efve control mice, MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and SUM159 tumor-bearing mice (n = 15/group) and subjected to qPCR analysis using primers specific to the human ALU sequence.Expression of the premetastatic niche markers fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 is enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, lungs were harvested and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned (4 \u00b5m) and subjected to immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against murine fibronectin (FN) (a,e,i); tenascin-c (TNC) (b,f,j); periostin (POSTN) (c,g,k) or MMP9 (d,h,l) prior to analysis by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.). Four random sections/lung/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (FOVs)/section were analyzed at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group). Representative lung sections are shown from (a\u2013d) tumor-na\u00efve control mice; (e\u2013h) MCF7 tumor-bearing mice and (i\u2013l) SUM159 tumor-bearing mice. Scale bars: low magnification images = 300 \u03bcm (left panels); high magnification images = 70 \u03bcm (right panels).Mice bearing triple negative SUM159 tumors demonstrate increased mRNA expression of the premetastatic markers fibronection, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX and CCL2 in the lungs. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and snap-frozen. RNA was isolated from lungs and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis to assess the expression of murine fibronectin (a), tenascin-c (b), periostin (c), MMP9 (d), collegen A1 (e), LOX (f) and CCL2 (g) (n = 15 mice/group). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. \u03b1 = significantly different from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls. \u03b2 = significantly different from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.005).The presence of a triple-negative SUM159 breast tumor modifies the soluble lung microenvironment to enhance breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Triple-negative SUM159 or luminal A MCF7 human breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice, and primary breast tumors were allowed to develop up to a mean tumor size of 1500 mm3. Animals were euthanized at the endpoint, and lungs were harvested and used for the generation of lung-conditioned media (LCM) as described previously. To assess migration, (a) SUM159 or (b) MCF7 cells were subjected to transwell migration assays for 18 h as described in the Materials & Methods. To assess proliferation, (c) SUM159 or (d) MCF7 cells were subjected to BrdU incorporation assays as described in the Materials & Methods. Five high-powered fields of view (HP-FOV) were used to enumerate migrated or proliferating cells using ImageJ software (NIH). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (LCM from n = 15/mice per group). \u03b1 = significantly different from LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice (p < 0.05). (e) RayBio\u00ae Mouse Antibody Array AAM-BLM-1 membranes (RayBiotech; n = 3/group) were exposed to dialyzed, biotin-labeled media samples, washed, labeled with HRP-streptavidin and visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure. Venn diagram showing the number of similar versus unique proteins identified under each LCM condition.Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from triple negative breast cancer cells induce expression of the premetasatic ECM markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts. Breast cancer-derived EVs were isolated from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines as described in the Materials and Methods and characterized as described in Supplemental Figure S4. Cell lines included non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D), three TN cell lines (MDA-MB-231 (231), SUM159 and LRCP17 (derived from a patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells. Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were treated with 50 \u00b5g of EVs from each cell line source every 12 h for 48 h prior to RNA and protein isolation.

        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

This microenvironment provides all the necessary stimuli for tumour survival, growth, and invasiveness. Inflammatory cells and the pro-inflammatory cytokines they produce are essential components of this microenvironment.Monocytes originating from blood differentiate into either M1 or M2 subtype macrophages, depending on the environmental stimuli they receive. Human M1 macrophages demonstrate elevated expressions of CD14, CD16, CD64, CD86, and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR\u03b1; whereas, CD163 and CD206 are markers associated with M2 macrophages. In breast cancer, macrophages represent up to 50% of the tumour mass and there exists a correlation between the number of tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) and poor prognosis. Macrophages have roles in almost all stages of tumour progression. In the primary tumour, they stimulate angiogenesis and facilitate invasion. During metastasis, macrophages prepare the pre-metastatic site and promote tumour cell dissemination as well as growth. They also generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment by disrupting natural killer (NK) and T cell functions. TAMs usually resemble M2 macrophages. During tumour development, tumour-infiltrating M1-polarized macrophages are generally identified by an IL-12high IL-10low phenotype and they enhance immune reactions that display anti-tumour effects. During late-stages of tumour progression, TAMs generally skew to an M2-like phenotype that is characterized by an IL-12low IL-10high phenotype and diminished tumouricidal activity. The identification of molecules driving macrophage plasticity in the cancer microenvironment could provide a basis for macrophage-focused diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.Fibroblasts are one of the most abundant cell types found in the tumour stroma. Fibroblasts turn into cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumour microenvironment. As tumours are described as \u201cwounds that never heal\u201d, CAFs are very similar to myofibroblasts, which are spindle shaped activated fibroblasts. Although there is no specific marker that is exclusively expressed by CAFs, alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) is widely used as a CAF marker. CAFs not only play an active role in tumour initiation and progression, but also sculpt the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have recently attracted attention for their function as regulators of immune cell recruitment as well as functions. Studies in breast cancer investigating the effects of stromal fibroblasts on monocytes/macrophages are very limited. In this study, we report for the first time that CAFs obtained from invasive breast cancer differentiated monocytes to M2-like pro-tumoural macrophages in terms of both phenotypic features and functions, in contrast to fibroblasts obtained from normal breast. We also demonstrated that CAFs were very effective in recruiting monocytes. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) were found to be crucial monocyte chemotactic cytokines that were secreted from stromal cells.ResultsCAFs, which are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs, effectively recruit monocytesCAFs are \u03b1-SMA expressing fibroblasts in contrast to NFs. CAFs and NFs were cultured in 8-well chamber slides, then stained for vimentin (A,D), pan-cytokeratin (B,E) and \u03b1-SMA (C,F). Both CAF and NF cells were positive for vimentin and negative for pan-cytokeratin. However, CAFs were positive for \u03b1-SMA, unlike NFs. Sup. Figure\u00a01 displays immunocytochemical stainings for fibroblast activation protein (FAP). One representative figure for each cell type is shown (\u00d7100).CAFs were isolated from breast cancer tissues obtained from patients undergoing mastectomy. As healthy counterparts, we used normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from normal breast tissues obtained from patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty. Primary cultures of both of those isolated fibroblasts were established. All fibroblasts utilized in the experiments were characterized by vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA expressions by immunocytochemistry. They differed in their expressions of \u03b1-SMA, which was consistently negative in NFs (n\u2009=\u20093) and positive in CAFs (n\u2009=\u20094). Representative figures of NFs and CAFs are shown in Fig.\u00a01.CAF and MDA-MB-231 cells effectively recruit monocytes. Monocytes isolated from healthy donors were serum starved and then were allowed to migrate for 5\u2009h toward CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Representative microscopic views of each condition are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from NFs, iii: CM from CAFs, iv: CM from MDA-MB-231 Cells). (B) CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in monocyte migration more than NFs did. The presence of CXCR4 (10\u2009\u00b5g/ml) or MCP-1 (130\u2009\u00b5g/ml) blocking antibodies diminished monocyte recruitment. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium, #p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. each corresponding control. Arrows demonstrate migrated/counted monocytes.In order to evaluate the effects of CAFs and breast cancer cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed cell migration assays. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy humans. Conditioned mediums (CMs) collected from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells were used in a Boyden migration assay, in which monocytes migrate toward CM in the bottom chamber. Our results demonstrated that CAFs as well as breast cancer cells recruited monocytes effectively (Fig.\u00a02A,B).Recruitment of monocytes by CAFs might be mediated by MCP-1 as well as SDF-1 cytokinesIn order to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying monocyte recruitment by CAFs, we focused on MCP-1 and SDF-1 cytokines. Our results showed that inhibiting MCP-1 or SDF-1 activity through MCP-1 or CXCR4 (a chemokine receptor specific for SDF-1) blocking antibodies, respectively, reduced monocyte migration, significantly. Although both SDF-1 and MCP-1 are relevant for monocyte recruitment mediated by both CAF and breast cancer cells; SDF-1 seems to be more important for CAF-induced monocyte recruitment, while MCP-1 is more prominent for breast cancer cell mediated monocyte migration (Fig.\u00a02B).CAFs induce a pro-tumoural phenotype, which resembles M2 macrophages like TAMs, in monocytes/macrophages in contrast to NFsCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce monocytes to differentiate into a M2 phenotype similar to TAMs. CD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs (NF-educated monocytes), CAFs (CAF-educated monocytes), MDA-MB-231 cells (MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes) or standard culture medium DMEM (control monocytes) for 7 days, then were analysed using flow cytometry. (A) The expression levels of PD-1, CD163, and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. The expression levels of HLA-DR and CD14 were significantly lower in CAF-educated monocytes than in NF-educated monocytes. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We established an in vitro model utilizing CD14+ cells isolated from healthy donors and CMs obtained from CAFs, NFs, and breast cancer cells in order to investigate the effects of the tumour stromal cells as well as the tumour cells on monocyte differentiation. Following 7 days of culture, the expressions of CD163 and CD206, which are mostly associated with M2 macrophages, were higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In addition, the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) was higher in CAF-educated cells than in NF-educated cells. In fact, NF-educated cells\u2019 expressions of PD-1, CD163 and CD206 were similar to control monocytes. On the other hand, the expression of CD14 was much higher in NF-educated cells than in CAF-educated cells. In addition, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (HLA-DR) expression of CAF-educated cells is much lower than that of NF-educated cells as well as breast cancer cell-educated monocytes. The expressions of CD86 were comparable between the groups (Fig.\u00a03).CAF-educated monocytes exhibit strong immunosuppressionCAF-educated monocytes suppressed CD4+ T cell proliferation more than NF-educated monocytes did. CAF-educated monocytes, NF-educated monocytes, MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes, control monocytes were co-cultured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled and autologous CD4+ T cells that were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads for 96\u2009hours. (A) The proliferation of T cells was suppressed by CAF-educated monocytes more strongly than control and NF-educated monocytes. Suppression of T-cell proliferation by CAF-educated monocytes is E:T dependent (normalized percentage of suppression of T-cell proliferation considering respective control monocytes are 40.1% and 53.3% for 1:4 and 1:2 E:Ts, respectively). (B) Representative histograms of the proliferation of T cells (monocytes:CD4+ T cells, 1:4). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01.We investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes could inhibit T-cell proliferation. For this purpose, human autologous CD4+ peripheral T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 magnetic beads were co-cultured with control monocytes, NF-, or CAF-educated monocytes. As shown in Fig.\u00a04, CAF-educated monocytes markedly suppressed T-cell proliferation in effector-cell-to-target-cell-ratio (E:T) dependent manner; since a higher E:T seems to result in a more prominent immunosuppression (Fig.\u00a04B).CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased motility of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A) Representative microscopic views of tumour cells that show invasion are shown (i: Standard Medium, ii: CM from Control Monocytes, iii: CM from CAF-educated Monocytes, iv: CM from NF-educated Monocytes, v: CM from MDA-MB-231-educated Monocytes). (B) Tumour cells that show invasion were counted and presented in bar graphs. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. standard medium. Arrows demonstrate counted tumour cells that show invasion.CAF-educated monocytes modify the expressions of EMT-related proteins and genes. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for 24\u2009hours. (A\u2013D) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by Western blot analysis of vimentin and E-cadherin proteins. Densitometry shows relative protein expression normalized for GAPDH (n\u2009=\u20093). (E\u2013G) The effects of NF-, CAF- or MDA-MB-231-educated monocyte CMs on the EMT of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were analysed by quantitative real-time PCR of Snail, Slug and Twist gene expressions (n\u2009=\u20093). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on the motility of breast cancer cells, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. The invasion of breast cancer cells was enhanced by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes (similar to MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes), whereas the invasion of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a05). In addition, we investigated the changes in expressions of EMT-related proteins of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells due to the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. For this reason, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with CMs from CAF-, NF-, or MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes. Vimentin expression was found to be increased and E-cadherin expression was found to be decreased in breast cancer cells by the effects of CAF-educated monocytes. On the contrary, neither vimentin nor E-cadherin expression was significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of control monocytes (Fig.\u00a06A\u2013D). Real-time qPCR results showed that CAF-educated monocytes induce breast cancer cell expressions of Snail, Slug and Twist genes; which are EMT-related genes, both compared with control monocytes and with NF-educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a06E\u2013G).CAFs re-direct differentiated M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophagesCAF and MDA-MB-231 cells induce M1 macrophages to differentiate into M2-like macrophages. (A) M1 macrophages were subsequently cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 48\u2009hours, cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of CD163 and CD206 were significantly higher in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages than in M1 macrophages alone. Representative histograms of each molecule are shown. (B) Data are presented as relative fold changes to control IgG in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. (C) M1 macrophages were cultured alone or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours and the levels of IL-12 or IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Levels of IL-12 was decreased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. In contrast, levels of IL-10 increased in CAF- and MDA-MB-231-educated M1 macrophages compared with that in M1 macrophages alone. *p\u2009<\u20090.05.We then set out to explore whether CAFs were able to induce the differentiation of M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages. For this reason, we cultured M1 macrophages with CMs of CAFs as well as breast cancer cells. After 2 days, the expression of CD163 significantly increased in M1 macrophages treated with CMs of either CAFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells; as a result, resembling the surface expression of M2 macrophages (Fig.\u00a07). Even though CD206 expressions of CAF- or breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages slightly increased, such increases were not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07B); whereas, CD206 expression of CAF-educated monocytes was shown to increase significantly (Fig.\u00a03B). In addition, we determined IL-10 and IL-12 cytokine levels in culture supernatants. IL-12 cytokine levels decreased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages. On the other hand, IL-10 cytokine levels seem to have slightly increased in the supernatants of both CAF- and breast cancer cell-educated M1 macrophages, although this increase was not found to be statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07C).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samplesCorrelation between the number of macrophages positive for CD163, and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts in breast tumour stroma with clinical and pathological features.\tNo. of cases\tCAF grade\u2021\tCD163+ macrophages*\tCD206+ macrophages*\t \tLow (n\u2009=\u200927)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200923)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200925)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200925)\tp value\u2020\tLow (n\u2009=\u200928)\tHigh (n\u2009=\u200922)\tp value\u2020\t \tAge\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u226450\t27\t16\t11\t0.57\t16\t11\t0.25\t13\t14\t0.26\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>50\t23\t11\t12\t\t9\t14\t\t15\t8\t\t \tGrade\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02\t8\t6\t2\t0.26\t7\t1\t0.04\t3\t5\t0.27\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03\t42\t21\t21\t\t18\t24\t\t25\t17\t\t \tKi-67 index#\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22645%\t4\t4\t0\t0.02\t4\t0\t0.03\t3\t1\t0.60\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>5%\t25\t8\t17\t\t9\t16\t\t13\t12\t\t \tLymph node involment\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Negative\t26\t13\t13\t0.58\t13\t13\t1.00\t16\t10\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Positive\t24\t14\t10\t\t12\t12\t\t12\t12\t\t \tTumor size\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u22642\u2009cm\t17\t13\t4\t0.03\t13\t4\t0.01\t9\t8\t0.77\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>2\u2009cm\t33\t14\t19\t\t12\t21\t\t19\t14\t\t \tMolecular subtypes\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ER/PR(+)\t16\t10\t6\t0.66\t9\t7\t0.09\t8\t8\t0.44\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HER2(+)\t11\t6\t5\t\t8\t3\t\t8\t3\t\t \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Triple negative\t23\t11\t12\t\t8\t15\t\t12\t11\t\t \t*The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to divide the patients into high and low grade groups.\u2021The grades of CAF area in stroma were used to divide the patients into two groups (low and high grade).#Ki-67 index was evaluated in 29 tissue samples.\u2020Data were analysed by Fisher\u2019s exact test and chi-squared test, and p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant.We analysed the presence of macrophages positive for CD163 and CD206 as well as \u03b1-SMA positive fibroblasts in 50 human breast cancer samples using immunohistochemistry. We divided the sample group into high and low grade groups based on the median number of CD163+ macrophages (64; range 18\u2212151), and CD206+ macrophages (15; range 2\u201350). We then analysed the associations of TAM grade with clinical and pathological features (Table\u00a01). High level of infiltration of stromal CD163+ macrophages was associated with higher histologic grade, higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume. High CAF grade was also associated with higher Ki-67 proliferation index, and higher tumour volume (Table\u00a01).High grade of CAFs significantly correlated with the number of TAMs in breast cancer tissue samples. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163, CD206, \u03b1-SMA, and Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) in breast cancer samples are shown. \u03b1-SMA (A), CD163 (B), CD206 (C), and H&E (D) were stained in a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (E), CD163 (F), CD206 (G), and H&E (H) were stained in a HER2+ breast cancer tissue sample. \u03b1-SMA (I), CD163 (J), CD206 (K), and H&E (L) were stained in an ER+PR+ breast cancer tissue sample (\u00d7400; scale bar, 50\u2009\u00b5m). Sup. Figure\u00a02 displays immunohistochemical stainings for laminin, CD34, and FAP.

Indeed, we found that high grade CAF tissues harboured higher numbers of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08A\u2013D and Table\u00a02). In addition, low CAF grade was associated with lower numbers of CD163+or CD206+ macrophages (Fig.\u00a08I\u2013L, Table\u00a02).CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cellsCAF-educated monocytes induce increased proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. Monocytes were cultured for 7 days with CMs from NF or CAF cells. All of the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009hours before obtaining the corresponding CMs. (A) Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were evaluated with MTT assay after 48\u2009hours of treatment with corresponding CMs and normalized cell numbers are shown (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20093). (B) MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in an ACEA E-plate. After a day of incubation, they were incubated with those CMs from differentiated monocytes for an additional 48\u2009hours. Cell index was measured by electrical impedance (n\u2009=\u20093). Normalized cell index (22:26:25, mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) as a measure for cell proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells that were treated with NF- (blue) or CAF-educated (red) monocyte CMs is shown. Vertical line demonstrates the time of normalization. **p\u2009<\u20090.01. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001. ns: not significant.In order to investigate the effects of CAF-educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro, we treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with CMs from CAF- or NF- educated monocytes. CAF-educated monocytes increased the proliferation of breast cancer cells. On the other hand, the proliferation of breast cancer cells was not significantly changed by the effects of NF-educated monocytes, compared to that of MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes (Fig.\u00a09A). Similar findings concerning the effects of NF- and CAF- educated monocytes on breast cancer cell proliferation were observed in real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence system (Fig.\u00a09B).DiscussionIt is now clear that there is a continual crosstalk not only between tumour cells and immune cells but also between stromal cells such as CAFs and immune cells. This crosstalk has an important role on development and progression of tumours. CAFs have recently been implicated in regulation of immune cell recruitment and function. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of cancer associated fibroblasts, compared with normal fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, on monocyte recruitment and polarization in breast cancer.The perspective concerning adult tissue macrophages being solely derived from bone marrow precursor cells have been recently abandoned. In fact, it has been shown that most tissue resident macrophages originated from yolk sac precursor cells. On the other hand, macrophages found in pathogen associated inflammation mostly originate from bone marrow monocytes. It has recently been show that most TAM sub-populations emerge from the Ly6C+ population of circulating mouse monocytes in grafted tumours, primary mouse mammary tumours and in lung metastases. Therefore, investigating the factors associated with monocyte recruitment to tumour tissues has utmost importance. Previous studies have shown that CAFs secrete large amounts of SDF-1. We found that CAF derived SDF-1 was crucial for monocyte recruitment, which underlines the key importance of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis for progression of several cancers. Previous studies have also shown that MCP-1 was able to induce infiltration of blood monocytes into CAF spheroids and to recruit monocytes into mammary tumours. Even though CAF-induced monocyte migration decreased with MCP-1 inhibition in our study, this decrease was not as prominent as that seen with SDF-1 inhibition. This finding demonstrated that SDF-1 is more significant in CAF-induced monocyte chemotaxis than MCP-1.Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor that is upregulated on activated T cells for the induction of immune tolerance. Monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have been shown to be effective against several types of cancer. In a very recent study, Gordon et al. have shown that PD-1 is also expressed by both mouse and human TAMs in addition to activated T cells. They also characterized PD-1+ TAMs and showed that almost all PD-1+ TAMs express an M2-like surface profile. In light of this important study, we investigated whether CAFs might have a role in inducing such immunosuppressive PD-1+ TAMs. The role of CAFs in the induction of PD-1 expression on TAMs have not been investigated before. We found that CAF-educated monocytes demonstrated high PD-1 expression as well as CD163 and CD206 expressions. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CAFs are able to induce a PD-1+ TAM phenotype by themselves, even without the presence of tumour cells. In addition, our findings prove that CAFs are as potent as tumour cells in terms of inducing such PD-1 expressions (Fig.\u00a03). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that PD-1+ TAMs are relevant for breast cancer in addition to colorectal cancer. In line with these findings, we suggest that CAFs may recruit monocytes and induce these recruited monocytes to differentiate into PD-1 expressing M2-like macrophages, instead of M1 macrophages. Therefore, PD-1 axis might be crucial in CAF induced immune suppression in vivo in several types of cancer including breast and colorectal tumours.In the current study, we also showed that CAF-educated monocytes exhibited increased expression of CD206 and CD163. Immune functions of CD206 (C-Type Mannose Receptor 1) has not yet been fully understood. It has been shown that the lack of CD206 results in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production during endotoxemic lung inflammation in mice and increased serum levels of inflammatory proteins, suggesting that it may have a role in the resolution of inflammation by decreasing inflammatory molecules in the blood. CAF mediated induction of higher expression of CD206, which has anti-inflammatory effects, on monocytes may also demonstrate another indirect mechanism of immune suppression by CAFs. CD163 is a haptoglobin-hemoglobin scavenger receptor and it correlates with known prognostic factors (e.g. poor differentiation (Grade 3), ER negativity and ductal type which are associated with bad prognosis). As one would expect, CAFs induced a very high CD163 expression on monocytes compared with NFs (Fig.\u00a03). Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells induced high CD163 and CD206 expressions on monocytes as well as MHC class II (HLA-DR) expression; whereas CAFs did not induce HLA-DR expression on monocytes. HLA-DR is well known to be associated with M1 macrophages. The induction of HLA-DR expression on monocytes by breast cancer cells may seem controversial; however, the study by Edin et al. has shown that colorectal cancer cells induce TAMs of a \u201cmixed\u201d M1/M2 phenotype, which in turn could contribute to a \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. Moreover, Helm et al. have demonstrated that HLA-DR and CD163 double positive cells were detectable by immunohistochemical stainings in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues. We propose that CAF-mediated down regulation of MHC class II expression on monocytes may demonstrate a mechanism of immune escape via decreased antigen presentation, in addition to confirming the notion that CAFs are not implicated in any types of \u201cgood inflammatory response\u201d. On the other hand, it should also be noted that NF-educated monocytes expressed both CD14 and HLA-DR, which are associated with M1 macrophages, more than CAF-educated monocytes. This finding shows that activated tumour stroma may have explicit functions in terms of macrophage polarization. In line with our findings, Zhang et al. demonstrated that the number of CD68+CD163+ macrophages was higher in breast cancer tissues than in normal breast tissues.Several studies showed that TAMs promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis by releasing a variety of cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrated that CAF-educated monocytes increased breast cancer cell invasion as well as the expressions of EMT-related genes and vimentin protein significantly, while decreasing E-cadherin protein expression; in contrast to NF-educated monocytes. Our in vitro migration assay findings and gene/protein expression results display that CAF-educated monocytes enhance the motility of breast cancer cells. In a very recent study by Linde et al., CD206+ macrophages were shown to downregulate E-cadherin junctions in breast cancer cells, which may facilitate EMT. Thus, our findings support the notion that CAFs promote EMT, invasion and metastasis; via inducing M2 macrophages. We then investigated whether CAF-educated monocytes have immunosuppressive features. CAF-educated monocytes significantly suppressed T cell proliferation in contrast to control or NF-educated monocytes. CAFs were known to directly inhibit proliferation of T lymphocytes. In the current study, we showed that CAFs also exert immunosuppressive effects, indirectly, by differentiating the monocytes into M2-like TAMs.Activation status of M1/M2 macrophages in tumour tissues is transient, which gives them a functional plasticity. Our results suggest that CAFs may re-direct M1 macrophages to M2-like macrophages in the tumour tissue. The differentiation of macrophages from anti-tumoural M1-like to pro-tumoural M2-like macrophages is a crucial event in the establishment of the tumour microenvironment. Thus, investigating the factors that drive the trans-differentiation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages in tumour tissues has great importance in terms of targeted therapies. We observed that CAF-educated M1 macrophages showed increased secretion of IL-10 and decreased secretion of IL-12 in addition to phenotypic changes (i.e. increased expression of M2 markers). Even though our results demonstrated that CAF-educated M1 macrophages seem to display increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206, the increase in the expression of CD206 did not reach statistical significance (Fig.\u00a07B). Given our results showing that CAF-educated monocytes show significantly increased expressions of both CD163 and CD206 (Fig.\u00a03B), CD206 expression change of CAF-educated M1 macrophages seems interesting. In fact, our studies with human breast cancer tissue samples also demonstrated that higher number of CAFs is correlated with higher numbers of not only CD163+ but also CD206+ macrophages (Table\u00a02). CD206 was reported to be more associated with M2a-like macrophages, while CD163 is prominent on the surface of M2c-like macrophages. In addition, Mantovani et al. reported that M2a macrophages are associated with TH2 type immune responses and elimination of parasites, while M2c macrophages are more implicated in immunoregulation and tissue remodelling. Therefore, CAFs may be inclined to polarize the M1 macrophages more into the M2c phenotype that is associated with immune suppression than M2a. Such a predilection seems reasonable considering tumours are known as wounds that do not heal and thus require a chronic wound healing/tissue remodelling process instead of an allergic response or killing of parasites. This might explain our results about CAF-educated M1 macrophages and our findings suggest that CAFs may be influencing M1/M2 trans-differentiation. It has been shown that IL-4, which is secreted from tumour cells and T lymphocytes, as well as colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are secreted from tumour cells, take part in pro-tumoural differentiation of macrophages. In line with these studies, we suggest that CAFs may also prove to be important players in this re-polarization process.Since the number of \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts was found to be significantly higher in the tumour stroma compared with that in benign breast tissue and the number of TAMs was higher in tumour stroma than in tumour nest, we analysed the tumour stroma to evaluate both of these cells rather than the tumour nest. We found that the number of CD163+ TAMs significantly correlated with high tumour grade, high Ki-67 proliferation index and high tumour size. In line with such findings, CAF-educated monocytes were found to increase breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro (Fig.\u00a09). The infiltration of CD163+ TAMs seemed to be the highest in triple negative, and the lowest in ER+PR+ breast cancer samples (Fig.\u00a08), although such findings were not statistically significant.The copresence of CAFs and TAMs inside a tumour was considered to be a potential prognostic feature in colorectal cancer patients. In the current study, we showed that there exists a significant correlation between the number of TAMs and the CAF grade in breast cancer. It was recently reported that CAF-derived Chitinase 3-like 1, which is implicated in inflammatory disorders, contributed to tumour growth in breast cancer and this contribution is accompanied by a high infiltration of M2-polarized macrophages and TH2 type immune responses. Therefore, our finding of increased infiltration of breast tumour tissues with TAMs might be a direct result of the presence of high number of CAFs in those tumours; since we also demonstrated that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce M2 type polarization.In this study, we examined the relationship between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and monocytes/macrophages in breast cancer using human ex vivo cellular systems and tissues samples obtained from breast cancer patients as well as in vitro cell lines. Even though our studies were not performed using in vivo systems, our results demonstrate that CAFs promote monocyte migration and enhance their differentiation to M2-like macrophages; based on phenotype, cytokine and functional features. In addition, our studies with human breast cancer patient tissue microarrays (TMAs) showed some translational promise. Future in vivo experiments will shed further light on such new mechanistic insights and provide broader implications, as such systems would simulate all the elements of the tumour microenvironment, as well as demonstrating the effects of cell-to-cell contact in addition to the cross-talk mediated via soluble factors demonstrated in our study. Accordingly, in vivo experiments in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice can be used to prove that human monocytes co-injected s.c. with tumour cells acquire a stronger protumoural effect if preconditioned with CAFs in contrast to NFs.Materials and MethodsIsolation of fibroblasts from normal and cancerous breast tissueNormal breast tissues were obtained from 3 patients undergoing reduction mammoplasty and breast cancer tissues were obtained from 4 patients undergoing therapeutic mastectomy. All fibroblasts were isolated using a previously described protocol that utilizes Collagenase I (1\u2009mg/mL) and Hyaluronidase (125 U/mL) enzymes followed by differential sedimentation and plating. Enzymatically digested tissues were then cultured in high serum media conditions which select for fibroblast growth (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s medium [DMEM] supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum at 37\u2009C, 5% CO2). All human breast tissues for all of the experiments were obtained in accordance with the laws and institutional guidelines, as approved by the institutional review board of Hacettepe University (Approval numbers: GO 16/64 - 20 and GO 17/380 - 31). Informed consent was obtained from all participants.Characterization of fibroblasts with immunocytochemistryCharacterizations of fibroblasts were performed by immunocytochemistry stainings with vimentin, pan-cytokeratin and \u03b1-SMA according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells (7\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/300\u2009\u00b5L in each well) were cultured in eight well chamber slides and immunocytochemical / morphological analyses were performed when the cells reached a surface confluency of >80%. A biotin/streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase detection system was utilized and binding of the antibody was demonstrated with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. The images were captured by Olympus BX50 microscope.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM)CMs were obtained from CAFs, NFs and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. When the aforementioned cells reached to a confluency of >80%, they were serum starved. After 48\u2009h, CMs were collected from cell supernatants and clarified by centrifugation.Isolation and culture of peripheral CD14+ monocytesPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD14+ monocytes from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based positive selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD14+ monocytes were cultured alone as control monocytes or with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (CM:RPMI, 1:1) for 7-days.Phenotypical analyses with flow cytometryCD14+ PBMCs isolated from healthy donors were cultured with CMs from NFs, CAFs, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells as well as in standard medium for 7 days, then analysed using flow cytometry. M1 macrophages were cultured with CMs from CAFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 48\u2009hours, then analysed by flow cytometry.Cultured monocytes or macrophages were detached using Accutase cell detachment solution, according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD206, CD163, HLA-DR, CD14, and PD-1. All antibodies were conjugated to Phycoerythrin (PE) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Respective isotype-matched antibody controls were used as negative controls.Isolation of peripheral blood CD4+ T-cellsPBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers\u2019 peripheral blood using density gradient separation with Histopaque-1077. Separation of CD4+ T-cells from PBMCs was accomplished by using a magnetic bead based negative selection protocol with a purity of >95%. CD4+ T-cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, 2.1 mM L-glutamine, 100\u2009U/mL penicillin and 100\u2009mg/mL streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2.CFSE proliferation assaysIn order to assess the effects of CAF-, NF- and MDA-MB-231-educated monocytes on CD4+ T lymphocytes, we performed functional analyses with flow cytometry. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labelled CD4+ T-cells were activated by CD3/CD28 magnetic beads (except the negative control group). Activated T-cells were cultured with either control monocytes or with monocytes that had been cultured with CMs from CAFs, NFs or MDA-MB-231 cells for 7 days. After 96\u2009hours, proliferation of CFSE labelled CD4+ T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry.Evaluation of cell migrationIn order to evaluate the effects of CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells on monocyte recruitment, we performed in vitro migration assays. Monocyte cells were seeded into the upper compartment in serum-free medium (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The 5\u2009\u00b5m Transwell chambers were placed into 24-well culture wells containing CMs from CAFs, NFs, or MDA-MB-231 cells. After 5\u2009h incubation, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x100).Evaluation of EMT-related protein expressions by Western BlotMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, cells were lysed in RIPA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). E-cadherin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; #3195) and vimentin (primary antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA; 5741) protein expressions in samples were examined by the Western blot method. GAPDH (primay antibody: Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #5174) was used as the Western blot loading control. The membranes were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL) and densitometry analyses of the protein bands were performed.Evaluation of EMT-related gene expressions by quantitative real-time PCRMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were cultured for 24\u2009hours prior to CM treatments. The cells were then treated with CMs from NF-, CAF-, MDA-MB-231- educated monocytes or from control monocytes for 48\u2009hours. At the end of this period, RNA isolation from the cells was performed according to the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit protocol. Complementary DNA was synthesized with Thermo Scientific RevertAid First Strand cDNA Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The qPCR data were analysed using the Livak model (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct). Snail (Snail_reverse 5\u2032-CTGCTGGAAGGTAAACTCTGGA-3\u2032, Snail_forward 5\u2032-CGAGTGGTTCTTCTGCGCTA-3\u2032), Slug (Slug_reverse 5\u2032-TTCTCCCCCGTGTGAGTTCTAA-3\u2032, Slug_forward 5\u2032-CACTGCGATGCCCAGTCTA-3\u2032), and Twist (Twist_reverse 5\u2032-CCCACGCCCTGTTTCTTTGA-3\u2032, Twist_forward 5\u2032-GCCGGAGACCTAGATGTCATT-3\u2032) gene expressions were evaluated. \u03b2 -actin was used as the reference gene.Evaluation of cell invasionMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion was evaluated by using Transwell inserts in vitro. Monocytes were differentiated for 7 days using CMs from NF, CAF or MDA-MB-231 cells as well as in standard medium. All the differentiated monocytes were then serum starved for 48\u2009h and corresponding supernatants were then collected. MDA-MB-231 cells in serum-free medium were seeded into upper compartments of Transwell inserts which were pre-coated with Matrigel (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 200\u2009\u00b5l). The lower compartment contained the aforementioned supernatants, which were obtained from monocytes. After 24\u2009hours, non-migrated cells were removed by cotton swab. Migrated cells were fixed by methanol and stained with Crystal violet. Migrated cells were counted in five different fields of polycarbonate filter under a microscope (magnification x200).Induction of M1/M2 polarization of macrophagesCD14+ monocytes were cultured in medium containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (50\u2009ng/ml) for 7 days to obtain M0 macrophages. In order to acquire M1 macrophages, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) (100\u2009ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (10\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days. On the other hand, M0 macrophages were further cultured in medium containing IL-4 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 2 more days in order to obtain M2 macrophages.Assessment of soluble factors by ELISAIn order to evaluate the levels of IL-12 and IL-10 cytokines in the culture supernatants of M1 and M2 macrophages, we performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). We cultured M1 or M2 macrophages alone (as negative control) or with CMs from CAFs, or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells for 2 days. After this period, the cells were further cultured for additional 2 days in serum-free medium. Culture supernatants were stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C until the assays were performed.Measurement of cell proliferation by MTT assayMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation was evaluated via MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferations were analysed after an additional 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total) by adding 25\u2009\u03bcl MTT reagent (final concentration: 1\u2009mg/ml) in each well. 4\u2009hours after adding the MTT reagent, the precipitate was solubilized by 80\u2009\u03bcl detergent reagent. The plates were then left overnight in the dark and the absorbances were recorded at 570\u2009nm.Real-time and label-free analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells with the xCELLigence systemIn order to assess the real-time effects of CAF- and NF-educated monocytes on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell proliferation, we performed functional analyses with the RTCA xCELLigence System (ACEA, San Diego, CA, USA). This system utilizes gold biosensor microelectrodes to measure electrical impedance. The background impedance of the microelectrodes were first measured with cell culture medium. Then, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were added to each well of the E-plate. After about a day of incubation, CMs obtained from CAF- or NF-educated-monocytes were added to the wells and the cell indices were measured by electrical impedance over an additional period of 48\u2009hours (72\u2009hours in total).Tissue samples and immunohistochemical stainingsA total of 50 human invasive breast cancer tissue samples were investigated. Patients who had received preoperative/adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Clinical and pathological variables including age, tumour grade and size, lymph node involvement, Ki-67 staining as well as ER, PR and HER2 status were evaluated.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour samples were used for tissue microarrays (TMAs). Blocks were made utilizing a 4.0\u2009mm tissue cylinder through a histologically representative area of each donor tumour block. From each donor block, 1\u20132 cores were cut and 8 TMA blocks were prepared. Immunohistochemical stainings for CD163 (Biocare, Clone 10D6, 10\u2009min EDTA, 1:100), CD206 (Abcam, ab64693, 20\u2009min EDTA, 1:200) and \u03b1-SMA (Neomarkers, Clone 1A4, 1:1000) as well as Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) were performed on the 4-\u03bcm thick sections taken from the tissue microarrays using Leica Bond Max III Autostainer, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Concentrations and antigen retrieval methods were optimized for each antibody using appropriate positive and negative controls.TAM and CAF grade evaluationsAll tissue microarray slides stained with anti-CD163 or anti-CD206 were analysed to identify areas with the highest levels of TAM infiltration. For each case, three hot spots in the tumour stroma (40x objective) were selected for counting TAMs. The median values of CD163+ or CD206+ macrophage numbers in stroma within the areas were used to categorize the patients into high and low grade groups. The intensity of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA positive spindle-shaped fibroblasts) was classified into 2 grades, using a modification of a method previously described: negative to scanty (low grade) or abundant (high grade) in a blinded analysis performed by 2 of the authors (K.K., and B.G.Y.).Statistical analysesThe Mann-Whitney U test, Student\u2019s t-test, chi-squared test, and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to examine differences in continuous and categorical variables. A 5% type-I error level was used to infer statistical significance. All statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows Software version 23.ConclusionsOur results propose that CAFs recruit monocytes and induce TAMs which might be suppressing the immune system via the PD-1 axis. We herein demonstrated that CAFs play pivotal roles in sculpturing the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer, and therapeutic strategies to reverse the CAF-mediated immunosuppressive microenvironment should be taken into consideration in order to increase the effectiveness of conventional therapies as well as immunotherapies against breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Betul Gok Yavuz and Gurcan Gunaydin contributed equally.Electronic supplementary materialSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1038/s41598-019-39553-z.Author ContributionsB.G.Y., G.G., M.E.G. and K.K. performed the experiments.

Similar to site of injury, tumors through production of paracrine and endocrine signals enrolled MSCs in their microenvironment (TME) that is seen as a \"wound that never heals\". The ability of MSCs to migrate to tumors makes them potential cargo for anticancer agents. Once reached the tumors, MSCs may exert opposite roles depending on tumor types, thus supporting cancer progression, as reported in breast, melanoma, prostate and colon carcinomas or suppressing it, as in malignant glioma. The main source of MSCs in adult is bone marrow, even if additional tissues have been identified as font. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) along with fibroblasts, pericytes, adipocytes, macrophages and immune cells play a crucial role into microenvironment of breast cancers, promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and invasion, neo-angiogenesis, drug resistance and evasion of immunosurveillance. Once in TME, BM-MSCs can trans-differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or vascular and perivascular cells switching from neutral role toward pro-tumorigenic behavior. Recently, we reported the ability of BM-MSCs to promote migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells through chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). In the last decade, different biomolecules have been found involved in BM-MSCs recruitment and activity into breast cancer including chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5); transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin 17B; CXCL10 and placental growth factor. Recently, it has been reported that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling plays an important role in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. In addition, Dhawan et al. showed that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) along with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in bone marrow support in the dissemination of breast cancer cells.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), representing ~15% of all breast cancers, are characterized by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and ErbB2, excluding the possibility of specific intervention for these tumors. They are biologically more aggressive and have a very poor outcome compared to other breast tumors.In this study, we investigated the role of PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSC homing and activity into the highly malignant and invasive mesenchymal-like (ML) TNBC subtype. We have recently demonstrated that cells of this subtype have a strong tendency to vasculogenic mimicry (VM) both in vitro and in vivo, and that targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 interaction by an anti-EGFR aptamer, results in inhibition of VM and tumor growth in ML TNBC.To interfere with the PDGFR\u03b2-mediated cross-talk between BM-MSCs and tumor cells, we used a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer, named Gint4.T, that we have previously characterized as high specific inhibitor of the receptor in human glioblastoma. The aptamer binds at high affinity (Kd: 9.6 nmol/l) to the extracellular domain of the PDGFR\u03b2 and impedes the ligand-dependent activation of the receptor both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it has been validated in vivo for its tumor targeting efficacy, resulting neither toxic nor immunogenic.Here we show that Gint4.T aptamer inhibits the migration of BM-MSCs towards TNBC cells and their trans-differentiation into CAFs. In addition, we used in vivo cell-tracking method to monitor instantly, noninvasively and in real time the inhibitory effect of the aptamer on BM-MSC homing to breast cancer xenografts, which ultimately results in interfering with BM-MSC-dependent pro-invasive activity. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic agent that blocks either the recruitment of BM-MSCs into TME and the tumor cell-stroma interactions thus hampering TNBC aggressiveness.Materials and MethodsCell lines and culture conditionAll human breast cancer cell lines came from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. MCF-7 and U87MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were grown in RPMI 1640.For production of MDA-MB-231 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), lentiviral constructs and infection of cells were conducted as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on 12-well plates and infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 10% FBS and 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 48 hours of incubation, infection efficiency was determined by analyzing GFP expression by flow cytometry.To obtain conditioned medium (CM) cells were grown in medium with 1% FBS for 48 hours. The medium was then collected, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes, and filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm filters (Millipore,Billerica, MA) before being used.The concentration of PDGF-BB in CM of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells was measured using the ELISA method as reported.Human BM-MSC isolation and cultureHuman BM-MSCs were provided by Dr. Lucarelli. Samples were taken from patients after obtaining informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute. Isolation and culture condition of human BM-MSC was performed as previously described. BM-MSCs immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146 (staminal positive markers) and CD34 and CD45 (staminal negative markers). The BM-MSCs were used between passages 3-5.BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes has been evaluated as reported.BM-MSCs grown in the presence of MDA-MB-231 CM for 48 hours are referred as \"BM-MSCMDA-MB 231\".RNA isolation and Real time-PCRRNA isolation and Real time-PCR was performed as previously described. Briefly, total RNA from BM-MSCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green reaction mixture (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and an ABI Prism 7000 (robocycler was used for amplification Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene-specific primers used for the amplifications were as follows:PDGFR\u03b25'-AGGACACGCAGGAGGTCAT-3' (forward)5'-TTCTGCCAAAGCATGATGAC-3' (reverse)\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)5'-ACCCAGCACCATGAAGATCA-3' (forward)5'-AGAGACAGAGAGGAGCAGGA-3' (reverse)Fibroblast-specific Protein 1 (FSP-1)5'-CTCTCCTCAGCGCTTCTTCT-3' (forward)5'-GGGTCAGCAGCTCCTTTAGT-3' (reverse)Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)5'-TACGTTTCATCACTGGCCCT-3' (forward)5'-CATCTGCTGTTCCGTGGATG-3' (reverse)\u03b2-actin5'-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3' (forward)5'-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3' (reverse)Sox25'-AGAAGGATAAGTACACGCTGC -3' (forward)5'-TCCAGCCGTTCATGTGC -3' (reverse)Nanog5'-GAAATACCTCAGCCTCCAGC -3' (forward)5'-GCGTCACACCATTGCTATTC -3' (reverse)Aptamers and treatments2\u2032F-Py RNA aptamers (Gint4.T and Scrambled), developed by Camorani et al. , were synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies and purchased from Tebu-bio srl (Magenta, Milan, Italy). Before each treatment, the aptamers were subjected to a short denaturation-renaturation step as reported.Gint4.T aptamer, PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitor: 5'-UGUCGUGGGGCAUCGAGUAAAUGCAAUUCGACA-3'. Aptamer used as a negative control and herein indicated as Scr: 5'-UUCGUACCGGGUAGGUUGGCUUGCACAUAGAACGUGUCA-3'.Cell lysate preparation and western blot analysesWhole-cell lysates and Western blots analyses were performed as previously reported. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3173, indicated as pPDGFR\u03b2), rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3169), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (CST-9271, indicated as pAKT), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT (CST-9272), rabbit polyclonal anti anti-phospho44/42 MAPK (CST-9101, indicated as pERK) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (A4700, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk1 (sc-93) and goat polyclonal anti-vinculin (sc-7649) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of the targeted antibody was revealed by ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Densitometric analyses were performed on at least two different expositions to assure the linearity of each acquisition using ImageJ software (v1.46r). Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and cell invasion were performed using a 24-well Boyden chambers (Corning, NY) containing inserts of polycarbonate membranes with 8 \u03bcm pores. For migration assays, all cells tested (0.3 x 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were plated into each upper chamber in the presence of different chemoattractants (lower chamber). After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, the non-migrating cells were removed from the top chamber using a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane insert were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol and counted in 10 random fields/filter at 200x magnification. Results are expressed as the percentage of migrating cells considering the untreated control sample as 100%.To perform invasion assays, the top compartment of Boyden chambers was coated with 50 \u03bcl of diluted (1:3 in PBS) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After coating, chambers were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow Matrigel to solidify. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (0.5 \u00d7 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were then added to each top chamber. After incubation for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, invaded cells were visualized and analyzed as described above.Analysis of BM-MSC trans-differentiation into CAFBM-MSCs and TNBC cells were co-cultured in trans-well chambers with microporous-3\u00b5m membrane (Corning, NY). To this aim, BM-MSCs (1 x 106 cells) treated or no with Gint4.T and Scr were seeded into the lower chamber in a 6-multiwell. After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (50 x 105 cells) were added to each top chamber. After 5 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, total RNA was extracted from BM-MSCs and analyzed for CAF markers: \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1.NIR fluorescent BM-MSC-labelingVivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent (MW: 1173 gmol-1; A: 676 nm; Em: 696 nm) was commercially obtained from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA), dissolved in 1.3 mL of warm sterile PBS (final volume of 2.0 mL). BM-MSCs (1 x 106) were re-suspended in 200 \u00b5L of sterile PBS and incubated with VivoTrack 680 (ratio 1:1, v/v) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C under agitation in the dark. Afterwards, the suspension was washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS to remove excess cell labeling agent. At that time, VivoTrack 680-labeled cell viability was assessed microscopically by Tripan-blue exclusion (GibcoTM). To verify that the cells were successfully labelled, they were examined by flow cytometry (BD Accuri\u2122 C6), using appropriate lasers and filters for detection of 680 nm wavelength.Animal Tumor Models and treatmentAll experimental procedures complied with the European Communities Council directives (2010/63/EU) and national regulations (D.L. 116/92) and were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations. The present study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization number 38/2015-01-28). MDA-MB-231 cells (10 \u00d7 106) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of 1:1 mix of physiological saline and Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the flank of five-week-old Female Balb/c nude mice which weighed around 18-20 g (Charles River, Milan, Italy). Once tumors became palpable (established), approximately 50 mm3 [volume = 0.5 \u00d7 long diameter \u00d7 (short diameter)2], nude mice were randomized into 2 groups (3 mice for each group) for imaging studies.In order to develop a system that models the entire metastatic process, we injected MDA-MB-231/GFP cells (1\u00d7106) in presence or absence of BM-MSCs (1\u00d7106) in 150 \u00b5l of PBS Matrigel mixture (1:1, v:v) orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of severely immunocompromised NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. BM-MSCs were treated with Gint4.T (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours prior injection. Mice (3 mice for each group) were monitored for development of primary xenograft tumor with high-frequency ultrasound system (Vevo 2100 equipment; FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sixty days post injection, mice were euthanized and tumors and organs were removed. They were either stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for paraffin embedding/sectioning and H&E staining, or they were embedded in O.C.T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound and 10 \u00b5m frozen sections were incubated with DAPI for 5 minutes to stain nuclei blue and subsequently prepared for fluorescent microscopy of GFP.In vivo tracking of BM-MSC to TNBC xenografts by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT)For FMT studies, tumor-bearing mice were maintained on a diet with a purified, alfalfa-free rodent chow for 15 days before fluorescent imaging to minimize fluorescence in the gut. VivoTrack 680 alone or BM-MSCs (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) labeled with VivoTrack 680 and treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours were administered to MDA-MB-231 xenografts by caudal vein injection. Mice under isoflurane anesthesia were analyzed at different time points by FMT 4000 imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Epifluorescence (2D) and tomography (3D) datasets were both acquired and analyzed by FMT system software (TrueQuantTM v4.0) from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA). 3D regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around tumor regions, and a threshold was applied equal to 30% of the maximum value of fluorescence in the adjoining non-tumor area. The total amount (pmoles) of fluorochrome was automatically calculated relative to internal standards generated with known concentrations of the appropriate dye. After imaging studies, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and then harvested for FACS analysis of labeled BM-MSCs.Statistical analysisResults were obtained from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1SD. Statistical values were defined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows by t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.ResultsBM-MSCs promote TNBC cells migration and invasionTo investigate whether BM-MSCs have the ability to promote migration and invasion of ML MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells a trans-well assay was performed, in which each cancer cell line was exposed to BM-MSCs, added in the lower chamber (Figure 1A). We found that TNBC cells migrated much avidly when co-cultured with BM-MSCs for 24 hours (Figure 1B). Similarly, when TNBC cells were seeded on top compartment of trans-well coated with Matrigel a strong stimulation of their invasion was observed in the presence of BM-MSCs (Figure 1C). We also found increased expression of stem cell markers, such as Sox2 and Nanog in TNBC cells upon BM-MSCs co-culture for 5 days (Figure 1D).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits PDGFR\u03b2-mediated signaling pathway in BM-MSCsIn agreement with previous reports, we found that BM-MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 protein and mRNA (Figure 2A). Human PDGFR\u03b2-positive glioblastoma U87MG and PDGFR\u03b2-negative breast cancer MCF-7 cells were used as positive and negative control, respectively, in western blotting (left panel) and Real Time-PCR (right panel) analyses.Since several evidences show a critical role for PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSCs homing to tumor sites including malignant glioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and colon carcinomas we wondered whether the Gint4.T RNA aptamer, that we previously validated as a specific inhibitor of PDGFR\u03b2, is able to interfere with this phenomenon. The aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of human PDGFR\u03b2 thus interfering with PDGF-BB ligand stimulation of the receptor. Firstly, we verified the aptamer ability to inhibit ligand-dependent PDGFR\u03b2 activation and downstream phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways in BM-MSCs upon PDGF-BB stimulation (Figure 2B).It has been reported that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 and downstream ERK and AKT signaling inhibited human MSC osteogenesis in vitro . Accordingly, we found that the aptamer hampered BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes (Figure S1).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSCs migration towards TNBC cellsNext, we determined whether the aptamer-mediated inhibition of intracellular signaling initiated by PDGFR\u03b2 results in impairment of BM-MSCs migration. As shown in Figure 3A, treating BM-MSCs with the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduced cell migration stimulated by serum, causing 44% inhibition as compared with the Scr aptamer. A similar effect was elicited by imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on different tyrosine protein kinases including PDGFR\u03b2.MSCs have been recently described to home into breast carcinoma in response to numerous endocrine and paracrine signals. Importantly, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer caused a dramatic reduction of their migration toward PDGF-BB ligand as compared with controls treatment (Mock and Scr) (Figure 3B). Next, we analyzed the secretion of PDGF-BB in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 by ELISA. The data showed that PDGF-BB detected in BT-549 was 12,84 \u00b11.52 pg/ml whereas in MDA-MB-231 was 6.46 \u00b11,46 pg/ml. Accordingly, Gint4.T strongly inhibited BM-MSCs migration to both TNBC cell lines (Figure 3C).These results indicate that inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 with Gint4.T hampers the homing of BM-MSCs to TNBC cell lines.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC trans-differentiation into Cancer Associated FibroblastsBecause CAFs are well known to play a key role in tumor progression and metastatic spread we wondered whether BM-MSCs when co-cultured with TNBC cells acquire the expression of CAF-specific markers. Interestingly, a significant increase of mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1 was observed when BM-MSCs were exposed up to 5 days to MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, thus indicating that TNBC are able to induce BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into CAF-like cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, Gint4.T treatment strongly reduced CAF markers mRNA expression in BM-MSCs, co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B, left) and BT-549 (Figure 4B, right) compared to Scr negative control, thus suggesting the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSC differentiation into CAFs in TNBC microenvironment. Further, in order to assess the effect of the aptamer on the pro-invasive function of CAF-like BM-MSCs, BM-MSCs were grown for 48 hours in the presence of CM from MDA-MB-231 (BM-MSCMDA-MB 231) to induce a CAF-like phenotype (Figure 4C). Next, MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness was assessed by using CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 as chemoattractant in the transwell invasion assay. As shown (Figure 4D), CM from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 strongly increased the invasion rate of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and, importantly, Gint4.T interfered with this event.These results indicate that blocking PDGFR\u03b2 on BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer not only decreased their ability to migrate towards TNBC cells but also their capability to trans-differentiate in CAFs and to induce a pro-invasive phenotype of TNBC cells.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts as assessed by Fluorescence Molecular TomographyTo follow the homing of BM-MSCs toward TNBC in vivo, we labeled the cells with VivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent. As assessed by flow cytometry analysis, a total labeling efficiency was obtained at the experimental condition used (Figure 5A). First, we checked the absence of cell viability loss after labeling (data not shown). Then, nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts, were intravenously injected with VivoTrack 680-labeled BM-MSCs, treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer, and analyzed by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography at different time-points (Figure 5B). 3D images were reconstructed and volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated around the tumor. The fluorescence signal of BM-MSCs was visualized in the tumor at 2 hours post-injection and remained visualized up to 24 hours (Figure 5C). Because VivoTrack 680 emits at NIR wavelength where autofluorescence and tissue absorbance are minimal, a low fluorescence was observed in the tissues around the tumor. As shown, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer strongly reduced BM-MSC recruitment into MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared to the negative control (Figure 5C). Moreover, FACS analysis of NIR labeled BM-MSCs in cell suspension from tumors, revealed a significant decrease of BM-MSCs recruitment in tumors after their treatment with Gint4.T aptamer (Figure 5D), thus confirming the results of in vivo imaging. These findings prove the ability of the aptamer to inhibit tropism of BM-MSCs to TNBC targeting PDGFR\u03b2.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivoIn agreement with previous report we found that the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells is not affected when breast cancer cells were co-injected with BM-MSCs in mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice (Figure S2). Conversely, BM-MSCs increased the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in orthotopic model thus correlating with our in vitro findings. To investigate whether the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer has the ability to inhibit BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivo, GFP-labelled MDA-MB-231 were mixed with BM-MSCs, left untreated or prior treated with Gint4.T, and injected in mammary fat pad of mice. After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lungs were extracted for analysis. Although no visible macro-metastatic lesions were observed in each experimental mouse group, GFP fluorescence was evident in the lung sections demonstrating microscopic metastasis. As shown (Figure 5E), BM-MSCs induced a significant enhancement in the number of detectable multifocal metastatic lesions that was counteracted by Gint4.T treatment.DiscussionSince the tumor microenvironment contributes to many aspects of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, the different stromal cell types, which play key roles in determining or enhancing several hallmark capabilities in different TMEs, should be taken into account to stimulate future anticancer drug development. In particular, the recent discovery that MSCs can be recruited into TME and promote cancer progression has led to consider MSCs as a suitable target for anti-cancer therapy. Importantly, tumor associated-MSCs contribute to tumor cell growth and metastatic behavior in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, osteosarcoma and colon cancers. The high tropism of MSCs for malignant tumors is largely similar to what observed for inflamed and injured tissues and involve the same growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. Tumor cells are able to produce a chemotactic gradient consisting of different chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12 and CXCL16, which is able to recruit MSCs.Jung et al. (2013) showed that MSCs were both recruited as well as transformed in CAFs by CXCL16 produced by prostate cancer cells. In turn, MSC-like CAFs secreted CXCL12 that binding to CXCR4 on tumor cells induced an EMT, which ultimately promoted metastasis to secondary tumor sites.Many growth factors such as PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), TGF-\u03b2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been found to effectively mediate MSC homing to TME.Interestingly, several studies reported PDGF-BB as a critical mediator of MSC tropism to gliomas. It has been reported that recruitment of MSCs towards pancreatic tumors in response to PDGF, EGF and VEGF, can be inhibited by Glivec, Erbitux and Avastin, respectively. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that bFGF and downstream ERK/Smad3 signaling pathway are involved in BM-MSC tropism to 4T1 breast cancer cells by using a specific neutralizing antibody.An increasing number of evidence has shown that MSCs in primary tumors can differentiate in active components of the tumor microenvironment such as CAFs, which are known to play a key role in tumor progression, neo-angiogenesis, EMT and metastatic spread. Therefore, great interest has been shown in developing therapeutic targeting strategies aimed to inhibit MCS support thus improving therapeutic efficacy in treating cancer. Thus, in this scenario, the starting point for MSC targeted therapy is the identification of specific molecular pathways involved in pro-tumorigenic cross-talk between MSCs and cancer cells. The delineation of key molecular pathways that underlie this important interplay has improved the knowledge of the biology of TME, tumor spreading, and carcinogenesis. Over past years, several studies have shown that MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 suggesting that it could play a crucial role in processes in which MSCs are involved. In fact, it is widely reported that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in specifying MSC commitment to mesenchymal lineages as well as in MSC proliferation and self-renewal. Furthermore, PDGFR\u03b2 signaling has emerged as a predominant pathway in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. Hata et al. , for example, have demonstrated that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in MSC tropism for malignant gliomas, providing direct evidence that tumor is capable of attracting MSCs in an intracranial glioma model through PDGFR\u03b2 pathway. Furthermore, it has been reported that PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC recruitment into TME, contributed to enhance the aggressive and invasive properties of many other tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colon carcinomas. However, although PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitors have already been tested for their capability to target and interfere with receptor activity in MSCs, no studies have still demonstrated the possibility to target PDGFR\u03b2 to prevent pro-tumorigenic effect of MSCs into tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the current class of PDGFR\u03b2 drugs consists of small molecule TKIs that show limited specificity and modest efficacy whereas no antibodies have entered the clinic. This study reports, for the first time, an innovative therapeutic tool, an anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer able to prevent BM-MSC recruitment and activity into TNBC microenvironment. Recent evidences have widely shown that BM-MSCs can integrate into the tumor-associated stroma and promote the progression of TNBC through the activation of different mechanisms involving HIFs, TGF-\u03b2 and CCL5. Up to now, no work has demonstrated the involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 pathway in MSC homing toward TNBC microenvironment, as well as MSC-mediated TNBC progression. Interestingly, in this study we show that the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduces both in vitro BM-MSC migration stimulated by two different TNBC cell lines and in vivo BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts, as assessed by FMT. These results underline the importance of PDGFR\u03b2 in mediating MSC migration towards TNBC site and highlights Gint4.T aptamer to specifically prevent PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC tropism for TME. Finally, recent evidence has demonstrated that MSCs selectively proliferate in TME and trans-differentiate in pro-tumor supporting CAFs. Although the effect of MSCs on growth of breast cancer is controversial and probably depends on the experimental setting of the animal model, conversely, it is well established that MSCs have a significant impact on promoting breast cancer metastasis. Our data demonstrated that Gint4.T aptamer not only hampers PDGFR\u03b2 downstream signaling in BM-MSCs, but it also interferes with their recruitment into TNBC and with their differentiation into CAF thus preventing metastatic lung lesions (Figure 6).ConclusionsTumor microenvironment recruits MSCs from the circulation, adjacent tissues and bone-marrow thus educating these cells to adopt pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. MSCs in tumor cause a formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and can also enhance the proportions of cancer stem cells, promote EMT, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis. These effects contribute to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Our aptamer-based approach to interrupt the cross-talk between cancer cells, MSCs and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment will likely provide new anti-cancer opportunities.Abbreviations\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBM-MSCsbone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cellsCAFcarcinoma-associated fibroblastCCL5chemokine C-C motif ligand 5CLLchronic lymphocytic leukemiaCXCL10C-X-C motif chemokine 10CXCR4chemokine receptor type 4DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionERK 1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2FAPfibroblast activation proteinFBSfetal bovine serumFMTFluorescence Molecular TomographyFSP-1Fibroblast-specific Protein 1MLmesenchymal-likeMSCsmesenchymal stem cellsPDGF-BBplatelet-derived growth factor BBPDGFR\u03b2platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2PI3Kphosphatidyl-3-kinaseROIsregions of interestTAMstumor-associated macrophagesTMEtumor microenvironmentTNBCtriple-negative breast cancerTGF-\u03b2transforming growth factor \u03b2VOIsvolumes of interestSupplementary MaterialInteraction of MSC with tumor cellsMesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancer metastasisBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the tumor microenvironmentMesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.

Journal of Pathology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.IntroductionCarcinomas are composed of neoplastic cells admixed with many types of supportive cells, which constitute the tumour stroma. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the predominant cell type within cancer stroma, play significant roles in overall breast cancer development and spread. Genetic and epigenetic changes activate stromal fibroblasts, which then escort cancer cells throughout the whole carcinogenic process in a paracrine manner. Indeed, activated fibroblasts secrete high levels of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases such as the MMPs, which are used to communicate with cancer cells as well as with other stromal cells. CAFs exhibit some important features of neoplastic cells and have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models. High numbers of active stromal fibroblasts are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs were shown to play major roles in drug resistance and tumour recurrence.Surgery is considered the first line of treatment for most breast tumours. During lumpectomy, the tumour is removed with some normal surrounding tissues (surgical margins) to ensure the removal of all tumour cells and to minimize local recurrence. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that surgical margin status influences the risk of local recurrence. Recurrences arise most frequently in the tumour bed. Thereby, radiotherapy is usually applied as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of relapse. Furthermore, targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) was also used and yielded very low recurrence rates when given as a boost. Importantly, TARGIT impaired the stimulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion caused by surgical wounding. This may be due to the immediate effect of radiation on the local tumour microenvironment, making it less favourable for tumour growth and progression. This suggests that cancer may recur following breast conserving surgery due to residual unresected tumour or to the presence of active stromal cells, or both. In fact, even in tumour-free tissues, the microenvironment could still play a capital role in tumour development/recurrence. Indeed, it has been recently shown that breast cancers with higher mean stiffness values at shear-wave elastography, which is related to the surrounding stroma rather than to the cancer itself, had poorer prognostic features. Therefore, we sought to undergo molecular and cellular characterization of breast stromal fibroblasts from negative surgical margins. We show that these cells exhibit a specific gene expression profile and are procarcinogenic.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblasts were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients under Research Ethical Committee Project No. RAC#2031091. CAFs were derived from tumour areas of the samples, while TCFs were developed from histologically normal tissues located at least 2 cm away from tumours (invasive ductal carcinomas). Processing of tissues was performed after routine examination by a certified anatomical pathologist, using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Normal fibroblasts (NBFs) and epithelial cells (NLECs) were derived from healthy age-matched females who underwent breast reduction surgery. In the present experiments, NBFs, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, under the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). NLEC cells were cultured in universal medium [1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10\u20138 m choleratoxin, 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium), 0.4 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone, 2 \u00d7 10\u20139 m T3 (tri-iodothyronine) and 5 mg/ml oestrogen, and were used at passage 2. MCF-7 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured following the instructions of the company. All supplements were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA), except for antibiotic/antimycotics and ITS, which were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.Conditioned medium (CM) was obtained from cells cultured in medium with serum, whilst serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was obtained from cells cultured in the absence of serum. In both cases, the cells were cultured for 24 h before the media were collected and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were used either immediately or were frozen at \u221280\u00b0C until needed.Affymetrix exon array and data analysis; quantitative RT\u2013PCRExon array protocols are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. Quantitative RT\u2013PCR was conducted as described previously. All reactions were performed in triplicate and the data analysed using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. The respective primers are presented in Supplementary materials and methods.Cell proliferation assayCells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.5\u20131 \u00d7 104 cells/well and incubated overnight. The medium was replaced with SFCM and incubated for different time intervals (0, 24 and 48 h). Cell proliferation was measured by the tetrazolium salt colorimetric assay, as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) after incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. The amount of formazan was quantified at 450 nm.Immunoblotting, cytokine array and ELISAImmunoblotting of total cell protein lysates was performed as previously described. Antibodies are presented in Supplementary materials and methods. SFCMs from CAF, TCF and NBF cells were applied to a RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody array (RayBiotech Inc.), as recommended by the manufacturer. ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems; or RayBiotech for MMP-2). These experiments were performed in triplicate.Chemotaxis and invasion assayInvasion chambers (24-well) were used according to the manufacturer's guidelines (BD Bioscience); 2\u20134 \u00d7 105 cells were added to the upper wells, separated by an 8 \u00b5m pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel basement membrane matrix (for invasion) or without (for migration). The membranes were stained with Diff Quick (Fisher Scientific) after removing the non-migrated cells from the top of the membrane, using Q-tips. After air-drying, the membranes were cut and mounted on slides with oil and cells that had migrated to the underside of the filter were counted using a light microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer) in five randomly selected fields (magnification \u00d740). Each assay was performed in triplicate.Orthotopic tumour xenograftsAnimal experiments were approved by the KFSH & RC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and were conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. Fifteen female nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer orthotopic xenografts were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. Tumour size was measured with a caliper, using the formula: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsSurgical margin stromal fibroblasts exhibit a specific gene expression profileTo identify the molecular changes that can take place in breast stromal fibroblasts from surgical margins, gene expression profiles of five paired CAFs/TCFs as well as three NBFs were examined. Total RNA was extracted and genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed, using Affymetrix's GeneChip\u00ae Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (HE 1.0 STAs). Three different comparisons were performed: TCFs with CAFs; TCFs with NBFs; and CAFs with NBFs. p < 0.05 and a threshold of absolute fold change \u2264 2 \u2265 was considered a significant difference in the analysis of the microarray data. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed 804 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TCF, CAF and NBF cells. The unsupervised two-dimensional (2D) hierarchical clustering revealed a clear pattern of gene expression, defining three main transcriptome clusters corresponding to TCFs, CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1A).Differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Total RNA from five CAFs, their corresponding TCFs as well as three NBFs was used to perform genome-wide gene expression analysis. (A) Unsupervised 2D hierarchical clustering of significantly varying genes across the three groups was performed using Pearson's correlation with average linkage clustering (only the top 112 of the most significantly dysregulated genes are shown for readability). (B) The three dominant PCA components that contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix clearly distinguished samples as CAF, TCF and NBF. (C) Venn diagram showing differential gene expression between the groups. (D) qRT\u2013PCR data for the indicated genes (mean \u00b1 SD)Unsupervised principle components analysis (PCA), which contained about 70% of the variance in the data matrix, further showed the presence of three distinct groups (Figure 1B). Intriguingly, the TCF samples clustered closer to CAF cells than to NBFs. Moreover, the gene expression variability was highest for the TCF group (Figure 1B). Next, Venn diagram analysis was performed, with the significance of overlaps calculated using hypergeometric distributional assumption and p values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This comparison approach revealed a significant overlap between TCFs and CAFs as compared to the two other comparisons (p < 10\u20135) (Figure 1C). Indeed, among the three comparisons, the least number of DEGs was between CAFs versus TCFs, with only 42 DEGs (Figure 1C). On the other hand, the number of DEGs between CAFs and NBFs reached 101 (Figure 1C). Comparing TCF with NBF, we found 77 DEGs, 25 of which were also differentially expressed between CAFs and NBFs, while the levels of 49 genes were uniquely dysregulated in TCFs as compared to NBFs and CAFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that TCF cells present in surgical margins exhibit specific gene expression patterns relative to their corresponding CAFs and also normal breast fibroblasts.Quantitative RT\u2013PCR validation of gene expression resultsTo validate the RNA microarray analysis, we performed quantitative RT\u2013PCR on nine genes: MMP-3, ITGB8, SFRP4, ITGBP7, ADAMTS1, CTGF, PTGS, SDHC and CCL-2. Figure 1D shows differential expression of all these genes between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. These results confirm the presence of differential gene expression between CAFs, TCFs and NBFs.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokinesNext, we assessed the level of secreted pro-carcinogenic cytokines from CAFs, TCFs and NBFs. Therefore, CAF-114, TCF-114 and NBF-6 were cultured to 80% confluency and then complete medium (CpM) was replaced with serum-free medium (SFM). Serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) was collected after 48 h of incubation and applied to the Ray Bio\u00ae human cytokine antibody array map. The array showed differential levels of various cytokines between TCF, CAF and NBF cells (Figure 2A). Upon quantification and normalization against the positive controls probed on the membrane, it was clear that CAFs secreted the highest levels of the majority of these cytokines (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the levels of SDF-1, CCL-25, TIMP-1 and TNF-alfa were also higher in TCF-114 cells than in NBF cells (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained when comparing CAF-180, TCF-180 and NBF-1 (data not shown). This shows that TCFs, although present in histologically normal parts of the breast, secrete high levels of various pro-carcinogenic cytokines.TCF cells secrete high levels of pro-carcinogenic cytokines. SFCMs from the indicated cells were collected and applied on the human cytokine antibody array map. (A) Cytokine array maps highlighting the differentially expressed cytokines. (B) Quantification of the array data for selected cytokines. (C) SFCMs were used to assess the levels of the indicated proteins by ELISA in CAF/TCF pairs from three patients compared to NBF-6 (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005)TCFs secrete high levels of SDF-1, VEGF-A and IL-6To further show the variation in cytokine secretion, SFCMs were collected from three different CAFs and their corresponding TCFs (87, 180 and 142) and NBF-6, and were used to assess the levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A by ELISA. Figure 2C shows that CAF cells secreted the highest levels of the three cytokines. Interestingly, the secreted levels of SDF-1, IL-6 and VEGF-A were also higher in all TCFs compared to NBF-6 (8.2-, 4.2- and 25-fold higher, respectively) (Figure 2C). Figure 2C also shows inter-patient variation in the secreted levels of these important pro-carcinogenic factors. These results confirm that TCF cells secrete higher levels of pro-carcinogenic factors relative to normal breast fibroblasts.TCF cells from surgical margins exhibit features of active fibroblastsTo test whether fibroblasts from surgical margins display features of activation, we examined the levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 (two major markers of active breast fibroblasts) by immunoblotting. Interestingly, like CAF cells, TCFs also express higher levels of \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 than NBF-6 and NBF-1 (Figure 3A). However, while the level of \u03b1-SMA was similar in TCFs and their corresponding CAFs, SDF-1 levels were slightly higher in CAF cells as compared to their respective TCFs (Figure 3A). Next, we studied the migratory and invasiveness abilities of TCF cells, using chambers either coated with Matrigel (invasion) or uncoated (migration). While CpM was added as a chemo-attractant to the lower wells of the chambers, cells (4 \u00d7 105) were added to the upper wells in serum-free medium for 24 h. Figure 3B shows that while NBF-1 and NBF-6 cells were unable to migrate, TCF-87 and TCF-180 cells showed invasiveness and migratory abilities. However, the number of invading and migrating TCF cells was lower than that of their corresponding CAF cells (Figure 3B). This provides further evidence that TCF cells display active fibroblast features.TCFs are active fibroblasts. (A) Immunoblotting for \u03b1-SMA and SDF-1 of the indicated cell lysates. (B) Invasion/migration assays. The numbers of invaded/migrated cells are presented in the histogram (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005 for TCFs compared to NBF-1 and NBF-6; note that CAFs are also significantly different)Surgical margin fibroblasts enhance the proliferation of non-cancerous epithelial cellsTo further show the active state of TCF cells, we studied their paracrine effect on the proliferation of epithelial cells. SFCMs collected from CAF/TCF-142, -180, -87 and \u2212114 pairs and from NBF-6 and NBF-1 were used for culturing non-cancerous MCF10A epithelial cells. Proliferation of MCF10A cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF and TCF cells, compared to NBF cells. TCFs showed an intermediate effect between CAFs and NBFs (Figure 4). Indeed, after 24 h of incubation, SFCMs from TCF-87 and CAF-87 enhanced cell proliferation two- and four-fold, respectively, compared to SFCM from NBF cells (Figure 4). Similar results were obtained with CAF/TCF-180 and \u2212142 pairs (Figure 4). For CAF/TCF-114, both enhanced the proliferation of MCF10A by four-fold at 24 h of incubation (Figure 4). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs also enhance the proliferation of epithelial cells in a paracrine manner.TCF-conditioned medium enhances the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MCF10A cells were cultured in SFCMs from the indicated fibroblasts from four patients and proliferation measured at the indicated times using the WST-1 assay, compared to SFCMs from the two NBF cultures performed at the same time. Error bars represent \u00b1 SDTCFs promote migration/invasion and induce mesenchymal features of breast cancer cellsWe next investigated the effect of TCF cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. SFCMs collected from TCF-180, CAF-180 and NBF-6 were added to MCF-7 cells (105) that had previously been seeded in the upper compartments of migration/invasion plates. Figure 5A shows that the number of migrated MCF-7 cells was much higher in the presence of media conditioned with CAF-180 and TCF-180 than with NBF-6 cells or SFM (used as negative control). Figure 5A shows that SFCMs from both CAF-180 and TCF-180 enhanced about 73-fold the migration ability of these breast cancer cells as compared to NBF-6.TCF cells enhance the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells and promote EMT. (A) SCFMs from the indicated cells were added into the lower compartments of 24-well BD BioCoat plates. MCF-7 cells (105) were seeded onto the upper compartment of the plates and incubated for 24 h. The numbers of invaded and migrated cells are presented (mean \u00b1 SD; *p < 0.005). (B, C) MCF-7 or normal luminal epithelial cells (NLEC) were treated with the indicated SFCMs for 24 h and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodiesNext, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanism/pathway that underlies TCF-dependent increase in the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. Therefore, we explored the paracrine effect of TCF cells on the phosphorylation/activation of Akt, a known pro-invasive protein kinase. Epithelial MCF-7 cells were treated with SFM or SFCM from TCF-180 and CAF-180 for 24 h. Figure 5B shows that SFCMs from TCF and CAF cells increased the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt, with no effect on the level of total protein. Since active Akt and the increase in the invasiveness/migratory abilities of breast cancer cells accompany the transition of these epithelial cells to the mesenchymal phenotype, we assessed the level of N-cadherin and Snail and showed that SFCM from TCF cells increased the level of these two important markers of mesenchymal cells (Figure 5B). On the other hand, the levels of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and EpCam were markedly reduced (Figure 5B). These results indicate that, like CAFs, TCF cells have the ability to trigger the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process.TCF cells activate Akt and up-regulate PCNA and MMP-2 in normal luminal cells in a paracrine mannerSince TCFs are present in histologically normal parts of the breast, we sought to investigate their effect on primary normal luminal epithelial cells (NLECs). Therefore, NLECs were incubated for 24 h with SFCMs from TCF, CAF and NBF, and cell lysates were used for immunoblotting. Figure 5C shows increase in the level of the proliferation marker PCNA in luminal cells pretreated with SFCMs from CAF and TCF cells, with a higher effect of CAF cells (Figure 5C). Similarly, the level of the phosphorylated/active form of Akt and also MMP-2 increased under the paracrine effect of TCF and CAF cells (Figure 5C). This shows that, like CAF cells, TCFs have the ability to promote tumourigenesis in normal luminal epithelial cells.TCFs stimulate breast cancer growth in an orthotopic mouse modelTo investigate the effect of fibroblasts on tumour growth in vivo, 15 nude mice were randomized into three groups and breast cancer tumours were created by co-implantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (5 \u00d7 106) with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells (2 \u00d7 106) under the nipple of each mouse. All mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and CAF-180 cells developed tumours. On the other hand, while two of five mice co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and TCF-180 cells had tumours, only one mouse co-injected with MDA-MB-231 and NBF-6 cells developed a tumour (Figure 6A). Importantly, this tumour appeared 29 days post-injection, while tumours containing TCF and CAF cells appeared only 15 days after implantation (Figure 6B). Furthermore, at 40 days post-injection, while the size of the tumour containing NBF-6 cells reached a volume of 1.4 cm3, the tumours containing TCF and CAF cells reached 4 cm3 and 7 cm3 on average, respectively (Figure 6A, B). This shows that, like CAFs, TCFs have the ability to promote tumour formation and growth compared to normal fibroblasts.TCFs enhance the formation and the growth of human breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice. Breast cancer xenografts were created by co-injecting MDA-MB-231 cells with NBF-6, TCF-180 or CAF-180 cells under the nipples of nude mice. (A) Tumour size 40 days post-injection. (B) Time-dependent tumour growth (mean \u00b1 SD)DiscussionWe have shown here that breast stromal fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins exhibit a specific gene expression pattern compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts and normal breast fibroblasts, with 77 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and NBFs and 42 genes differentially expressed between TCFs and their paired CAFs. Intriguingly, the expression pattern of 49 genes was specific for TCF cells, as compared to CAFs and NBFs (Figure 1C; see also Supplementary material, Table S1). This indicates that fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues around tumours may also be affected by the presence of tumour cells. Notably, the genes that were found differentially expressed uniquely in TCFs were enriched with biological processes and functions related to, among others, inflammatory response, response to stimulus, immune cell trafficking, tissue development and cell signalling (see Supplementary material, Figure S1A, Table S2). To elucidate how these deregulated genes are interacting with genes in various metabolic pathways, the DEGs were mapped to gene networks using the ingenuity knowledge base. The network analysis revealed the potentially important role of CCL13, CTGF, CYP1B1, IGFBP7 and B4GALT1 (see Supplementary material, Figure S1B). Interestingly, genes deregulated in TCF cells interact, directly or indirectly, with the UBC gene (see Supplementary material, Figure S1C), which plays an essential role in maintaining ubiquitin levels, especially under stress conditions. Indeed, this polyubiquitin gene is up-regulated by cellular stresses and contains classical heat-shock elements in its promoter, suggesting that stress-related factors are involved in the TCF-specific gene expression profile and may relate to evidence that cancer cells use oxidative stress to activate adjacent fibroblasts. Comparing the variation in gene expression in each cell type showed variability within the three categories of cells. Interestingly, the gene expression profiles of TCF cells were more heterogeneous than those of CAF and NBF cells (Figure 1C), indicating higher patient-to-patient variability in stromal fibroblasts present in histologically normal tissues.Differential gene expression between CAF and TCF cells from breast tumours has been reported previously. Bauer et al found 37 genes differentially expressed between six paired TCFs and CAFs and have also shown higher gene expression variability in TCF than in CAF cells. In another study, 420 genes were found to be differentially expressed between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts from mammoplasties (NBFs). Similarly, we have shown here that the expression of 101 genes varied between CAF and NBF cells. However, the current study presents the first micro-array comparative analysis between surgical margin fibroblasts, their corresponding CAFs and NBFs. In addition, we have shown that fibroblasts present in cancer-free surgical margins have higher migratory/invasiveness abilities than normal breast fibroblasts. Furthermore, these cells enhanced the proliferation rate of non-carcinogenic epithelial cells and the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro, as well as the formation/growth of breast tumour orthotopic xenografts in mice (Figures 5, 6). Interestingly, like CAFs, TCFs induced features of mesenchymal cells in breast cancer cells. Moreover, TCFs up-regulated PCNA and MMP2 and activated Akt in normal breast luminal fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. This indicates that these cells have the ability to promote cancer development and progression. This effect could be mediated through secretion of cytokines and/or energy transfer mechanisms (reverse Warburg effect).Notably, the magnitude of all these TCF-related effects was intermediate between those of CAFs and NBFs. This shows that, despite their localization in histologically normal breast tissues and not being in direct contact with cancer cells, TCFs acquired some myofibroblast features, suggesting that cancer cells can affect not only cancer-associated fibroblasts but also fibroblasts present in cancer-free adjacent tissues. This effect could be mediated through secreted molecules able to diffuse from cancer cells through normal tissue, reaching distant cells. TGF\u03b2 could play an important role in this effect. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 can induce the production of \u03b1-SMA in mammary fibroblasts in vitro and consequently transdifferentiates fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. It is also possible that cancer cells activate adjacent fibroblasts through the aerobic glycolysis process (Warburg effect), which produces pyruvate and lactate. Indeed, treatment with lactate transport inhibitor prevented the conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts.Our data indicate that remaining active fibroblasts following resection may enhance the chances of tumour recurrence, since these cells may constitute a fertile soil for tumour growth. To date, the most appropriate amount of normal breast tissue that should be removed to minimize local recurrence remains controversial. However, it is well known that local recurrence in patients submitted to conservative surgery is more common than in patients treated by mastectomy, showing the importance of surgical margins status for local relapse. Furthermore, several publications have reported the importance of the pathological margin status in determining the risk of local recurrence after breast conserving therapy. In conclusion, the present data show that breast stromal fibroblasts localized in cancer-free surgical margins are active and hence can potentiate the carcinogenesis process, and indicate that the tumour microenvironment may play determinant roles in local recurrence. Therefore, in the era of personalized therapy, the status of tumour stroma should also be taken into consideration for more efficient treatment and the prevention of recurrence as well as metastasis.Author contributionsMAA, S-FH and AAl performed experiments and analysed the data; FA performed experiments on the mice; DC and NK performed the micro-array data analysis; OA provided the tissues; AA supervised the work and analysed the data; and DC and AA wrote the paper.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.

Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

However, recently, clinical and experimental evidence have revealed that tumor development is intimately related to the complex interactions that transpire within the tumor microenvironment. Neoplastic epithelial cells engage in reciprocal molecular dialogues with surrounding stromal cells, including inflammatory cells, vascular cells and fibroblasts, resulting in the production of stromal-derived tumor-aiding factors, such as growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, proteases, and vascular-stimulating factors. These molecular communications at the site of the primary tumor enable its growth and dissemination.Breast cancer represents one example of a carcinoma in which the collaborative efforts from malignant epithelial cells and stromal cells within the primary tumor coordinate carcinogenesis, and ultimately, metastasis to distant organs. Women have a 12% risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes, and a 5% risk of breast carcinoma-related death. Mortality results from frequent metastasis, which reduces long-term survival (+5 years) from approximately 90% to 5%. A xenograft model of breast cancer has shown that breast carcinoma cells depend on stromal cells to metastasize. This may be explained by the finding that the stroma plays a paramount role in supporting breast tumor growth and vascularization, both of which are prerequisite to metastasis. Because of the importance of the tumor/stromal interactions in promoting breast cancer metastasis, it is imperative to elucidate the molecular events that occur between cancer cells and adjacent stroma at the site of the primary tumor.Of particular interest are the stromal fibroblasts found within mammary carcinomas, which by volume constitute the major cellular component of the tumor microenvironment. Termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), these cells have been connected to several tumor-promoting events, including: angiogenesis, anti-tumor immunosuppression, genetic instability, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. Although the importance of these cells in tumor progression has been acknowledged, CAFs have not been clearly and universally defined, and are only roughly characterized by their enhanced production of tumor-promoting factors.Similar to the way in which a tumor is equated to a \u201cwound that never heals\u201d, CAFs have been compared to \u201cactivated fibroblasts\u201d or myofibroblasts, which are present in inflammatory environments, where they play a critical role in angiogenesis and the production of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Several studies suggest that myofibroblasts constitute the majority of CAFs, as determined by alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), a marker for differentiated myofibroblasts. In contrast, other data suggest that not all CAFs within the tumor microenvironment are myofibroblasts. For example, Holliday and colleagues established that only 35% of CAFs isolated from primary breast carcinomas were \u03b1SMA-positive, and that this mirrored the expression of \u03b1SMA in normal breast fibroblasts. Yet other studies characterize CAFs by elevated stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) expression. Sugimoto and colleagues demonstrate that the expression of commonly used \u201cCAF-markers\u201d, including \u03b1SMA, vimentin, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) do not overlap with each other. Thus, they conclude that CAFs are a heterogeneous population and that the use of these markers alone will not suffice to identify all CAFs. We speculate, therefore, that multiple CAF subpopulations exist and suggest that they evolve from a variety of origins.Indeed, Orimo and Weinberg have proposed three models by which CAFs are derived in human carcinomas: clonal selection of a group of fibroblasts or progenitors that have acquired genetic alterations; transdifferentiation of normal stromal fibroblasts, without acquiring genetic alterations; and differentiation of stromal fibroblasts recruited from specialized progenitor cells in circulation. Studies support the notion that CAFs are either derived from bone marrow progenitor cells and/or that they evolve from the conversion of normal mammary fibroblasts or other resident cells, such as endothelial cells or epithelial cancer cells.We are interested in the mechanism(s) by which breast cancer cells solicit normal, human resident mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) to produce inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors, and thus become activated and CAF-like, and/or mature CAFs. Little is known about the molecular determinants of the transformation of an HMF to a CAF. In the current study, we examined the transdifferentiation of primary normal resident HMFs to activated fibroblasts, or to acquire CAF-like phenotype, in response to breast cancer secreted factors. We measured factors that have previously been affiliated with CAFs and/or the activated fibroblasts found in sites of inflammation. Our data demonstrate that SUM102 breast cancer cells, which were derived from an intraductal breast carcinoma, secrete factors that stimulate normal HMFs to express tumor-enhancing, inflammatory-related factors, including matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and the G-protein coupled receptor, CXCR4.The neutral protease, MMP-1, is recognized as a critical factor in breast cancer metastasis, and its roles as a mediator of matrix degradation and as a modulator of cell behavior have been established. However, no study has examined MMP-1 expression and function during the transition from an HMF to a CAF, nor has the function of this protease been identified in CAF isolates from breast cancer patients, although it has been associated with matrix remodeling by activated fibroblasts in inflammation.The overexpression of chemokines and their receptors, such as CXCR4, is also well documented as a key stimulus in promoting breast cancer tumorigenesis. Classically, CXCR4 is markedly upregulated on breast cancer cells, allowing them to migrate to targeted distant organs containing cells that secrete its ligand, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1). However, it has also been documented that CXCR4 expression is elevated in fibroblasts in inflammatory environments other than cancer. For example, synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis display constitutively expressed CXCR4 mRNA and cell surface protein. Similarly, studies show that fibroblasts from mice with pulmonary fibrosis express CXCR4 and respond chemotactically to SDF-1. Because the cancer microenvironment has been equated to a chronic site of inflammation, we propose that like activated fibroblasts in inflammatory conditions, CAFs also increase CXCR4 levels and that this contributes to breast cancer progression.Our study illustrates that MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels are increased in primary HMFs treated with factors secreted by breast cancer cells, and that MMP-1 and CXCR4 are functionally important for downstream signaling, cell migration, and matrix degradation. Notably, we use normal, primary HMFs in these studies to avoid potential artifacts, such as a spontaneous increase in CXCR4 following immortalization with telomerase. Importantly, we also demonstrate increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression and function in CAF isolates from primary breast tumors, compared to counterpart, non-tumor-associated fibroblasts from the same patient, signifying that our findings are clinically relevant. Together, our data suggest that breast cancer cells secrete growth factors and chemokines that stimulate normal resident HMFs to become CAF-like.RESULTSHuman mammary fibroblasts promote tumor engraftment and growth of 102 breast cancer cellsSUM102 (102) breast cancer cells were derived from an intraductal breast carcinoma and are ER-/PR-, suggesting that they are phenotypically aggressive. Since MMP-1 and CXCR4 mediate breast cancer invasion and metastasis by MDA-MB 231 (231) breast cancer cells in vivo, we compared MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression in 102 breast cancer cells to that of the well-established, aggressive 231 breast cancer cells. Compared to 102 cells, MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA was greater in 231 cells by approximately 35-fold and 70-fold, respectively (Figure 1A), indicating that the 102 cells do not express the same parameters as the 231 cells. Unlike 231 cells, which readily form tumors in vivo, when 102 cells were injected orthotopically into the 4th mammary fat pad of nude mice, they were weakly tumorigenic (Figure 1B), suggesting that tumorigenesis in these cells may depend on stromal/tumor cell interactions.Reports have documented that either non-cancer associated, normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) or carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) enhance breast tumor growth when injected simultaneously with mammary carcinoma cells into nude mice using an orthotopic model. We used this model to examine the functional ramifications of the molecular interactions between weakly tumorigenic 102 breast cancer cells and HMFs isolated from cancer free mammary tissues: 102 breast cancer cells were injected orthotopically into nude mice in the presence or absence of HMFs (Figure 1B). After 6 months, 100% of mice with concomitant injections of 102 breast cancer cells and HMFs developed tumors, while only ~33% of mice injected with 102 cells alone displayed tumors of modest size (~5mm) (P=0.0027) (Table 1). Moreover, when 102 breast cancer cells were co-injected with HMFs, larger tumors (~10mm) formed than when 102 cells were injected alone (***P=0.0006) (Figure 1B and Table 1). Cell number could not explain this finding, since twice as many 102 cells were injected into mice receiving only the tumor cells. Further, mice injected with HMFs alone yielded no tumors (Figure 1B and Table 1). Thus, we conclude that tumor formation and growth are augmented when mice were co-injected with 102 cells and HMFs, suggesting that 102 breast cancer progression is enhanced by the presence of human mammary fibroblasts. Soluble factors secreted by breast cancer cells up-regulate specific tumor-enhancing genes in nearby fibroblasts. We hypothesized therefore, that the weakly tumorigenic 102 breast cancer cells secrete soluble factors that aid in the transdifferentiation of resident mammary fibroblasts to tumor-promoting, activated fibroblasts, that are CAFs or CAF-like, and that subsequently, these activated stromal cells up-regulate inflammatory mediators that facilitate tumor progression.102 breast cancer cells stimulate the expression of tumor-promoting genes that are associated with cancer and inflammation in normal mammary fibroblastsTo determine whether factors produced by 102 carcinoma cells affect HMF gene expression, causing these stromal cells to gain an activated, CAF-like phenotype, we used real-time RT-PCR to measure the expression of a panel of genes known to be associated with CAFs and/or activated fibroblasts. Compared to control HMFs, treated with HMF cell conditioned media (HMFCM), HMFs treated with 102 cell conditioned media (102CM) exhibited significantly increased levels of several genes that have been previously associated with activated fibroblasts present in inflammatory situations and CAFs: MMP-1, MMP-3, IL-8, and SDF-1 (Figure 2A). Notably, these genes also promote breast cancer invasion and metastasis. As expected when studying primary cells from an out-bred population, we observed inherent differences in the responsiveness of HMFs treated with 102CM. Nonetheless, of the 12 primary HMF samples tested, ~70% were responsive.These data suggest that HMFs become activated or CAF-like in response to 102CM, and thus acquire an enhanced tumor-promoting phenotype following exposure to soluble breast cancer factors. However, 102CM did not induce other genes, including several classic CAF-related genes: FAP, \u03b1SMA, vimentin, and VEGF within 24h (data not shown). This finding suggests that resident HMFs, which become activated and CAF-like, may represent a distinct sub-population of CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. It is also feasible that HMFs may require additional environmental cues, which are absent in vitro, in order to transform into mature CAFs. Alternatively, other studies have shown that fibroblast precursor cells only express CAF-related genes, such SDF-1, \u03b1SMA and FAP, after 30 days of exposure to breast cancer CM.Perhaps most interestingly, we found that HMFs exhibited elevated CXCR4 mRNA levels in response to 102CM (Figure 2B), since overexpression of this receptor is usually associated with invasive breast cancer cells (see Figure 1A), while CAFs are recognized for secreting increased amounts of its ligand, SDF-1. As noted earlier, we also detected SDF-1 gene induction in HMFs exposed to 102CM (see Figure 2A). Elevated CXCR4 expression on breast cancer cells has been correlated with augmented angiogenesis and directional migration. Thus, CXCR4 induction in resident fibroblasts implies that these cells may also contribute to tumorigenesis, invasion and migration. We conclude that 102CM induces the expression of genes associated with activated fibroblasts and/or CAFs, and we will focus on MMP-1 and CXCR4 because of their documented importance in breast cancer progression. To emphasize the broad significance of this finding, media conditioned by 231 breast cancer cells, or their lung metastatic derivative, LM2 cells, also induced MMP-1 (top panels) and CXCR4 (bottom panels) mRNA in HMFs within 24h (Figure 2C). Due to the low levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 in the 102 cells, compared to those in the aggressive 231 cells (see Figure 1A) and LM2 cells (data not shown), the 102 cells represent a stronger model for examining the functional contribution of stromal-derived MMP-1 and CXCR4 in breast cancer progression. Thus, we focus on the effects made by 102 breast cancer cells on surrounding fibroblasts.Time course of MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels in HMFs exposed to soluble 102 breast cancer factorsTo define the time course of MMP-1 and CXCR4 induction in HMFs, mRNA was measured following treatment of these cells with 102CM or control HMFCM. Both MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA in HMFs increased steadily from 3h to 24h of exposure to 102CM (Figure 3A), while levels of these mRNAs were unchanged in HMFs treated with control media, HMFCM. Both MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression returned to original levels within 3h upon removal of the breast cancer cell CM (data not shown). Depending on the HMF sample, the relative fold change in CXCR4 between 102CM-treated HMFs and control HMFs ranged from 10-fold to over 50-fold, while fold change in MMP-1 induction ranged from 2-fold to 10-fold (data not shown).Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels correlated with gene induction. Neither HMFCM, nor 102CM alone generated measurable levels of latent or active MMP-1 (Figure 3B, left panel), confirming that basal MMP-1 levels in HMFs and 102 cells are low. However, 102CM triggered the secretion of both latent and active MMP-1 in HMFs, compared to HMFs treated with control media, HMFCM (Figure 3B, right panel). Bands larger than 52kDa in the CM represent glycosylated MMP-1. Similarly, high levels of CXCR4 protein were detected in HMFs treated with 102CM after 12h, while little CXCR4 was detected in HMFs treated with HMFCM (Figure 3C). HMF-derived CXCR4 protein diminished by 24h of treatment with 102CM (Figure 3C), possibly due to the increase in SDF-1 mRNA (Figure 3D), which typically ranged from 2- to 10-fold (data not shown). Indeed, the kinetic profile of SDF-1 is such that if SDF-1 levels begin to increase at 16h, it is possible that this chemokine is generated and binds CXCR4, causing internalization and degradation of this receptor by 24h ( and see Discussion). Media conditioned by 231 and LM2 breast cancer cells also induced MMP-1 and CXCR4 protein levels in HMFs within 24h (data not shown).Functional significance of increased stromal MMP-1 in the absence of breast cancer cell-derived MMP-1To demonstrate the functional importance of MMP-1 in HMFs, we used an in vitro collagen degradation assay, in which HMFs were embedded in a collagen gel and incubated with control HMFCM or 102CM. Immunohistochemistry detected MMP-1 protein produced by HMFs embedded in a collagen matrix when subjected to either HMFCM or 102CM for 6h (Figure 4A). While HMFs treated with 102CM stained positively for MMP-1, only a few cells treated with HMFCM were partially stained (see arrows), despite the equal number of cells per gel. Furthermore, collagen surrounding HMFs treated with 102CM displayed punctate MMP-1 staining throughout, indicating that these cells actively secreted MMP-1. In contrast, MMP-1 was not present in HMF-embedded gels treated with HMFCM.While very little degradation resulted when collagen-embedded HMFs were treated with HMFCM for 48h, collagen degradation by HMFs treated with 102CM was extensive, as measured by the amount of media liberated from the collagen as it was degraded (***P<0.0001) (Figure 4B). The negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. To confirm MMP-1 as the agent responsible for the collagen degradation, an MMP-1 neutralizing antibody was added to the collagen, and HMF-driven degradation of collagen was prevented (Figure 4C). Similarly, addition of a general MMP inhibitor, Ilomastat, abrogated collagen degradation (*P<0.05) (Figure 4C). Again, the negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. These data imply that weakly invasive 102 breast cancer cells, which do not produce MMP-1 (Figure 3B), can exploit nearby fibroblasts to produce MMP-1, resulting in the degradation of surrounding ECM.CXCR4 on HMFs stimulates downstream signaling and allows cells to migrate in response to exogenous SDF-1It has been demonstrated that cell-surface CXCR4 may be present on cells, but unresponsive to SDF-1 stimulation, as measured by downstream signaling. Since SDF-1 is the only known ligand for CXCR4, we determined whether SDF-1 successfully signaled through HMF CXCR4 by measuring the activation of p44/42 (Erk1/2), a component of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Addition of SDF-1 to HMFs for 5 minutes stimulated the phosphorylation of p44/42, indicating the activation of this pathway (Figure 5A, left panel). To confirm SDF-1 signaling through activation of CXCR4, cells were pretreated with a CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, and subsequently treated with SDF-1 for 0 or 5 minutes. Inhibition of CXCR4 blunted p44/42 phosphorylation by SDF-1 (Figure 5A, right panel), allowing us to conclude that upon binding to CXCR4, SDF-1 stimulates downstream signal transduction in HMFs. The partial inhibition observed with AMD3100 most likely reflects the fact that this MAPK pathway is activated by other mechanisms in these cells ( and data not shown).Standard chemotaxis assays were conducted to investigate the downstream function of the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis in HMFs stimulated with HMFCM or 102CM. These functional experiments also confirm that the increased total CXCR4 protein observed by western blot analysis results in increased surface CXCR4. Figure 5B represents a qualitative analysis of these results, which are quantified in Figure 5C. As expected, HMFs migrated toward FBS (positive control), but not toward BSA (negative vehicle control). Although HMFs treated with control HMFCM failed to migrate toward SDF-1, HMFs exposed to 102CM, and which therefore have increased CXCR4 levels (see Figure 3), migrated readily toward SDF-1 (***P=0.0001) (Figure 5B and C). To corroborate CXCR4 as the key mediator in HMF migration toward SDF-1, the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, was used to block CXCR4 signaling. Blocking CXCR4 reduced HMF migration toward SDF-1 by ~2\u20133 fold, as is evident in Figure 5B and C (***P=0.0016). Taken together, these data confirm that breast cancer cells secrete factors that not only induce CXCR4 protein levels in HMFs, but also that this receptor responds to its ligand by transmitting downstream signals and enhancing migration.MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA and protein are increased in primary CAFs compared to their counterpart fibroblasts and HMFsTo ascertain whether our observations were clinically relevant, we investigated MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression and function in CAFs isolated from primary human breast tumors, their respective (non-cancer-associated) counterpart fibroblasts (CPFs), and age-matched, HMFs from patients without cancer (Figure 6A). Basal MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA levels in CPFs were similar to those in normal, unstimulated HMFs, suggesting that non-tumor associated fibroblasts collected from patients with breast cancer have comparable MMP-1 and CXCR4 gene expression to those observed in HMFs taken from patients not afflicted with cancer. In contrast, basal expression of these genes was significantly higher in CAFs, demonstrating that clinically derived CAFs have constitutively increased levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA (*P<0.05) (Figure 6A). 102CM further stimulated MMP-1 and CXCR4 mRNA levels in HMFs, CPFs, and CAFs, suggesting that regardless of cell type, soluble factors from breast cancer cells stimulate the expression of these tumor-promoting genes (Figure 6A). To confirm their status as CAFs, we examined these cells for increased expression of a CAF-recognized gene, FAP, and found it to be elevated compared to FAP mRNA in CPFs (data not shown).Constitutive MMP-1 (top panel) and CXCR4 (bottom panel) protein levels were also increased in CAFs compared to HMFs and CPFs (Figure 6B). The multiple banding pattern for both MMP-1 and CXCR4 protein results from glycosylation. Flow cytometry detected increased CXCR4 surface expression on ~1.0% of CAFs, compared to ~0.1% of HMFs (Figure 6C). The percentage of cells expressing CXCR4 over time is likely higher than the values obtained, because CXCR4 is rapidly internalized, making it difficult to detect. Importantly, flow cytometry revealed that 10-fold more CAFs express CXCR4 than HMFs, and of these cells, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CAFs was consistently greater than the MFI of HMFs (data not shown). Because CXCR4 is rapidly internalized, this method of determining CXCR4 surface expression may be less definitive than a functional assay (see below).Migratory and invasive capabilities are increased in primary CAFs compared to their counterpart fibroblasts and HMFsTo measure the functionality of CAF-derived MMP-1, we assessed the ability of these cells to degrade collagen in the collagen degradation assay. HMFs and CPFs treated with naive, serum-free medium did not degrade the type I collagen. In contrast, CAFs readily degraded the collagen matrix, except when MMP-1 was neutralized with an antibody (Figure 7A). The negative values on the y-axis result from evaporation of media. These findings confirm and expand on previous studies, demonstrating that CAFs derived from clinical specimens not only maintain increased MMP-1 levels, but also that this fibroblast-derived enzyme degrades surrounding matrix, suggesting a role for these cells in vivo.To investigate whether CAF-expressed CXCR4 promoted chemotaxis toward SDF-1, these cells were examined in a standard migration assay. CAFs migrated readily toward SDF-1, while CPFs and HMFs did not (**P<0.001) (Figure 7B), and that the degree of migration corresponded with the relative levels of CXCR4 in these cells. Each of the primary cell lines migrated toward 10% FBS, the positive control, but were not attracted toward the negative vehicle control, 0.1% BSA (Figure 7B). Importantly, blocking CXCR4 function with AMD3100 abrogated CAF migration (***P=0.001) (Figure 7C), indicating that CAF-derived CXCR4 is necessary for the migration toward SDF-1 and demonstrating that CXCR4 expressed on these cells is functional.Thus, we conclude that CAF specimens derived from clinical material express increased MMP-1 and CXCR4, which potentiate the invasive and migratory phenotype of these cells. These results validate the clinical relevancy of our findings with HMFs treated with 102CM, since HMFs treated with 102CM share characteristics with CAFs obtained from patient specimens. Further, the data support the concept that inflammatory factors provided by breast cancer cells may initiate the HMF-to-CAF transdifferentiation.DISCUSSIONSome CAFs have been compared to the activated fibroblasts, or myofibroblasts, present in sites of wound healing and chronic inflammation. Myofibroblasts at sites of inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 expression, which facilitate cellular invasion and migration. Taken together, these observations support our hypothesis that MMP-1 and CXCR4 may also be elevated in fibroblasts that are found within the breast tumor microenvironment and suggest that these factors are induced as an HMF becomes more activated and CAF-like.In this report, we provide evidence to support this hypothesis. First, our data show that SUM102 breast cancer cells, which express low levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4, require mammary fibroblasts to grow in vivo (Figure 1). Second, the SUM102 cells secrete factors that stimulate the expression of several inflammatory factors, including MMP-1 and CXCR4, in adjacent stromal cells (Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that 102 breast cancer cells may solicit normal, resident HMFs to facilitate tumor growth in vivo. Further, increased MMP-1 and CXCR4 enhanced the invasive and migratory behavior of HMFs, verifying functional contributions of these cells to tumor progression (Figures 4 and 5). Finally, we validated these findings by demonstrating that mammary CAF isolates from patients with breast cancer have amplified basal MMP-1 and CXCR4 levels, which augment their invasive and migratory potential, respectively (Figures 6 and 7). In vivo, this phenotype may permit CAFs to degrade matrix as they migrate within the tumor microenvironment. Our findings emphasize the possible clinical relevance of MMP-1 and CXCR4 induction in CAFs, and demonstrate that normal HMFs exposed to soluble breast cancer factors acquire phenotypic characteristics shared with CAF specimens (Figures 6 and 7), indicating that breast cancer cells may initiate the conversion of resident HMFs to CAFs.The process of matrix invasion by malignant cells requires both degradation of the matrix and cellular migration. Studies conducted previously in our laboratory demonstrated that MMP-1 derived from breast cancer cells is necessary for tumor growth and invasion at the primary site. Since MMP-1 is secreted, it is reasonable to propose that stromal-derived MMP-1 functions similarly to that produced by the breast cancer cells. Furthermore, not all breast cancer cells produce MMP-1, increasing the importance of CAF-derived MMP-1 in tumor progression.CXCR4 up-regulation is most commonly linked to breast cancer epithelial cells; on the other hand, the ligand for CXCR4, SDF-1, has been classified as CAF-related. In this report, we have identified CXCR4 as a novel CAF-associated gene. This finding, coupled with the discovery that CAFs express increased levels of SDF-1, imply that an autocrine feedback loop may exist. It is possible that SDF-1 produced by CAFs binds to and signals through, CAF CXCR4, potentially causing important downstream effects. Specifically, the SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling axis results in a multitude of cellular functions: migration, homing, adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and the induction of MMPs. For example, SDF-1 signaling through CXCR4 on the activated fibroblasts in patients with rheumatoid arthritis results in their activation, migration and proliferation. Several breast cancer cell lines also secrete SDF-1; thus, it is feasible that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis functions not only in an autocrine manner, but also in paracrine fashion within the tumor microenvironment, where SDF-1 produced by tumor cells binds to CXCR4 on surrounding CAFs and vice-versa.Breast cancer cells over-expressing CXCR4 home to organs constitutively expressing SDF-1, such as the lungs, liver and bone, yet the in vivo function of CXCR4 on CAFs is currently unknown. Nonetheless, the in vivo function of CXCR4 on fibroblasts in other inflammatory diseases has been well documented and cancers have been likened to a wound that does not heal. For example, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, fibroblast precursor cells expressing CXCR4 have been shown to home to the lungs, which express elevated levels of SDF-1, thereby indicating that activated fibroblasts have the ability to migrate in vivo. Since we show that CXCR4 on CAFs is functional and that these cells are endowed with the ability to migrate towards SDF-1, we speculate that CAFs may migrate throughout the microenvironment of the primary tumor, degrading collagen through the secretion of MMP-1.A comprehensive list of CAF marker designations has not been definitively established. Instead, these cells have been associated with a variety of markers. Because CAFs may arise from various sources, it is not surprising that these cells could express different markers, and as a result, contribute to carcinogenesis differently. We did not observe increased levels of FAP, vimentin, and \u03b1SMA in HMFs exposed to soluble breast cancer factors. However, we document that normal HMFs increase several other CAF-related genes (see Figure 2A), including IL-8, SDF-1, MMP-3 and MMP-1. In addition, we demonstrated increased CXCR4 in CAFs and in HMFs in response to factors secreted by 102 breast cancer cells, a factor which has not previously been associated with CAFs. Since MMP-1 and CXCR4 are elevated in CAF isolates from the clinic, we suggest that the induction of specific genes by 102CM may represent an early transition phase of an HMF into a CAF and that these gene products facilitate breast cancer cell invasion and dissemination. Additionally, perhaps the high constitutive levels of MMP-1 and CXCR4 seen in the CAFs taken from patients have resulted from genetic alterations made within these cells.Despite reports documenting that normal HMFs or CAFs enhance tumor growth when injected simultaneously with mammary carcinoma cells into nude mice, it has also been proposed that normal HMFs can suppress breast tumor formation in vivo. Indeed, then, it would be reasonable to propose that early in tumor formation normal, resident mammary fibroblasts suppress tumor growth, but that following the breast cancer cell-induced transition of HMFs to CAFs, these cells enhance tumor pathogenesis. Alternatively, it is possible that HMFs require prolonged treatment with breast cancer cell CM. This concept coincides with data from Mishra and colleagues, who showed that fibroblast precursor cells become fully CAF-like (as determined by SDF-1, \u03b1SMA and FAP expression) after 30 days of exposure to breast cancer CM.In conclusion, we demonstrate that CAFs display amplified MMP-1 and CXCR4 and that normal HMFs acquire enhanced MMP-1 and CXCR4 levels in response to soluble breast cancer agents. Our data suggest that breast cancer cells may initiate the conversion of normal, resident HMFs to CAFs.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell lines and cell cultureSUM102 breast cancer cells (Asterand, Detroit, MI) were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 2% FBS, 5\u03bcg/mL insulin, 10ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1ug/mL hydrocortisone, Hepes Buffer, 100U/mL penicillin and 100ug/mL streptomycin. MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, Rockville, MD) and their lung metastatic derivative (LM2, a kind gift from Dr. Massague at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) 50/50 F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. Primary human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were isolated from women who had undergone reduction mammoplasty surgery (Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center) and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. All patients were enlisted in an IRB-approved protocol. Primary carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their respective counterpart fibroblasts (CPFs) (Asterand) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin 100U/mL, streptomycin 100ug/mL, and L-glutamine. All cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and in 5% CO2. All primary cells were used between passages 2 and 6.Breast tumorigenesis in vivoCells were suspended in 100\u03bcl of Matrigel\u00ae (BD Biosciences), and female mice (strain nu/nu, ~49 days old, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were injected orthotopically (4th mammary fat pad) with 2\u00d7106 SUM102 cells, 2\u00d7106 HMFs, or 1\u00d7106 of each cell line simultaneously. Eight mice were injected concomitantly with both cell lines, while six mice were injected with each cell line alone. Tumors were measured biweekly with calipers, and mice were sacrificed when tumor diameter exceeded 12mm, or at the termination of the study (6 months). The Dartmouth College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved animal studies.Generation of conditioned mediaTo condition media, cells were plated at 5\u00d7106 cells (102 breast cancer cells) or 1\u00d7106 (HMFs) per 150mm plate (~85% confluence) and left to seed for 24h in serum-containing media. The cells were then rinsed three times with Hank\u2019s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) and 15mL of serum-free Ham\u2019s F12 media, containing 0.2% lactalbumin hydrolysate (LH), were added per 150mm culture plate and conditioned for 24h at 37\u00b0C. After incubation, media were transferred to a conical tube, centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5 minu tes to pellet cellular debris, and then decanted into a new conical tube. Conditioned media (CM) were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until needed for experiments, at which time the media were thawed and added directly to cells.Quantitative real-time RT-PCRTotal cellular RNA was purified using Qiagen\u2019s RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Total cellular RNA was reverse transcribed using the TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), as directed by the manufacturer. Real-time PCR reactions were performed using 250ng of input RNA per reaction, as described. Data were averaged and normalized to the housekeeping gene, hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). mRNA values were calculated using 2\u2212(\u0394\u0394C(t)) and are presented as fold change compared to control conditions. Primer sequences were: CXCR4: 5\u2032-TGGGTGGTTGTGTTCCAGTTT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATGCAATAGCAGGACAGGATGA-3\u2032 (reverse); HPRT: 5\u2032-AGCTTGCTGGTGAAAAGGAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CCAGATGTTTCCAAACTCAACTTGA-3\u2032 (reverse); IL-8: 5\u2032-CTCTGGCAGCCTTCCTGATT3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TATGCACTGACATCTAAGTTCTTTAGC-3\u2032 (reverse); MMP-1: 5\u2032-AGCTAGCTCAGGATGACATTGATG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GCCGATGGGCTGGACAG-3\u2032 (reverse); MMP-3: 5\u2032-TTCCGCCTGTCTCAAGATGATAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AAAGGACAAAGCAGGATCACAGTT-3\u2032 (reverse); SDF-1: 5\u2032-CACATGTTGAACCTCTTGTTTAAAAGC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AACGCCAAGGTCGTGGTCGTGCTG-3\u2032 (reverse). cDNAs were assayed in triplicate.In vitro collagen degradation assayThis assay was carried out as previously described. Briefly, neutralized collagen was mixed with equivalent volumes of cells to yield 5\u00d7105 cells/mL and 500\u03bcl of the collagen/cell mixture was added to each well of a 24-well plate. After the collagen solidified at 37\u00b0C (~15 minutes), 0.5mL of control HMF cell conditioned media (HMFCM) or 102 cell conditioned media (102CM) containing ~0.00003% trypsin to activate latent MMPs was added carefully to each well in the presence or absence of anti-FLAG antibody control (1\u03bcg/mL, Sigma), an MMP-1 neutralizing antibody (1\u03bcg/mL, Chemicon) or Illomastat (25\u03bcM, Chemicon). After 48h at 37\u00b0C, the overlying media were removed and weighed. The media released from a collagen gel were calculated by weighing the total media collected minus the original media added (0.5mL=0.5g). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and experiments were repeated at least three times. Assays stained for MMP-1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) were terminated at 6h, so that gels embedded with HMFs and treated with 102CM were not entirely degraded. Collagen gels were removed from wells with a rubber spatula, fixed in 1090 neutral buffered formaldehyde and processed for histological staining in the Pathology Department at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). Goat MMP-1 antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was diluted to 1:100.Immunoblotting and antibodiesProteins from HMFs and 102 breast cancer cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. MMP-1 protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) from 1mL media, while CXCR4 was analyzed in whole cell lysates, which were suspended in 2x Laemmli lysis buffer (Sigma). Blots were probed with an MMP-1 antibody (Chemicon, Billerica, MA) diluted 1:2000, a CXCR4 anitbody (Chemicon) diluted 1:2000, phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) diluted 1:1000, or actin antibodies (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) diluted 1:10,000. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:2000 in the appropriate blocking buffer.SDF-1/CXCR4 signalingHMFs were plated at 2.5\u00d7105 per 60 mm culture plate and allowed to seed overnight. After 24h, the cells were rinsed with HBSS and 102CM was added to all plates for 8h, after which time SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/ml, R&D Systems) was added for 0, 0.5, 1, 3, or 5 minutes and then cells were lysed in 150\u03bcl Laemmli buffer and prepared for immunoblotting for p44/42. Samples treated with AMD3100 (5\u03bcg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR4, were pretreated for 30 minutes, and then either vehicle control (0.1% BSA in 1X PBS) or SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/ml) was added for 5min.Migration assaysHMFs (5\u00d7104) were plated with media containing serum FluoroBlok\u2122 inserts (BD Falcon, 6.5mm, 8.0\u03bcm pore) as described previously, and allowed to seed overnight. The following morning, cells were rinsed with HBSS and treated with either HMFCM or 102CM. After 8h, DMEM containing 10% FBS (positive control), 0.1% BSA in PBS (negative vehicle control), or SDF-1\u03b1 (100ng/mL) was added to the bottom chambers. Samples treated with AMD3100 (5\u03bcg/mL) were pretreated 30 minutes prior to adding attractants. Cells were permitted to migrate for approximately 18h, after which time the transwell inserts were exposed to the fluoroscent dye, Calcein AM (4\u03bcg/mL in HBSS, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ), to visualize and count only cells that had migrated through the membrane. Migration assays with CAFs were conducted similarly, but rather than using FluoroBlok\u2122 inserts, standard transwell inserts (Corning, 6.5mm, 8.0\u03bcm pore) were used. To analyze migration with this method, transwell inserts were exposed to Calcein AM for 30 minutes, and then cells on the bottom were detached by incubating inserts in pre-warmed trypsin with agitation for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. Medium containing 10% FBS was added to neutralize trypsin and pipetted to disperse cells evenly off the membrane. Cells were incubated for 3h and then were visualized by GFP fluorescence using excitation from a 100W Mercury lamp on an Olympus 1\u00d750 inverted phase contrast microscope and counted to quantify cell migration.Flow cytometryHMFs or CAFs were grown to confluence in 150mm plates and serum-starved overnight prior to being harvested for analysis of surface CXCR4 by flow cytometry. On the day of harvest, cells were rinsed with 1XPBS and incubated in acidic glycine buffer (0.05M glycine HCl buffer, pH 3, w/0.1M NaCl) for 1minute to ensure that stable receptors were stabilized, and then rinsed twice in 1X PBS. Pre-warmed Cell Stripper (a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution from Sigma) together with gentle scraping removed cells from the plates, and cells were immediately added to cold PBS with 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide and centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted and cells were either left unstained or stained with an anti-human CXCR4-PE-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems, Cat. #FAB170P) (diluted 1:50) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C and in the dark. After staining cells, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldahyde for 20 minutes and subsequently washed 3 times in cold PBS with 10% FBS. Cells were then resuspended in PBS supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide, and were analyzed using FacScan.Statistical analysisStudent\u2019s t test determined statistical significance. All samples were prepared in triplicate and experiments were conducted at least three times. Statistical power at the P<0.05 was considered significant.Figures and TableHuman mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) enhance tumor engraftment and growth of SUM102 breast cancer cells in vivo. A.

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

        "content": "Tumor metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have tropism towards tumor tissues, and can be converted into tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (TA-MSCs) to facilitate TNBC metastasis through interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and unclear, and effective strategies to suppress tumor metastasis via eliminating TA-MSCs are still lacking. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1) was overexpressed in TA-MSCs, which prompts TA-MSCs to secrete multiple C-C motif chemokine ligands, promoting C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and facilitating TAM polarization into the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting TNBC pulmonary metastasis. Z-GP-DAVLBH, an FAP\u03b1-activated vinblastine prodrug, induces FAP\u03b1<sup+</sup TA-MSC apoptosis, which significantly suppresses CCR2<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and polarization, thus inhibiting pulmonary metastasis of orthotopic TNBC cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts. This study provides insight into an important role of FAP\u03b1 in mediating TA-MSC-induced TNBC metastasis and provides compelling evidence that targeting TA-MSCs with an FAP\u03b1-activated prodrug is a promising strategy for suppressing TNBC metastasis.",

Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

(A) Representative images of lungs surgically removed from healthy animals or from animals intravenously injected with HT1080 cells: of these, 5 were untreated (vehicle), 5 were treated with Pep 2 either at 15 mg/kg or at 3.4 mg/kg. (B) H&E-stained of the corresponding representative lung sections with the neoplastic areas marked with T (4\u00d7 magnification, Scale bar 100 \u00b5m. (C) 50 ng of total genomic DNA extracted from lung samples from each vehicle, or Pep 2-treated mice were used as template for semi-quantitative PCR reactions and compared to the healthy lungs (H). The amplification products are separated on 1% agarose gels. A standard curve was included in every run, generated by mixing 107, 106,105,104,103,102,101,1 HT1080 human cells with 1 to 107 murine P19 cells (Standard 1 to 9). The uncropped image for agarose gel can be found in Figure S5. (D) The densitometric analysis of PCR amplification products, accomplished by acquiring images and quantifying them through ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), was performed on three independent gels. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells sample was considered as 100% and standards 2, 3, 4 and 5 were graded relative to that (** p < 0.005; *** p < 0.001, Student\u2019s t-test).Fibrosarcoma cell invasion in the presence of fibroblasts pre-exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 in 3D-Organotypic assays. (A) Time scale representation of the 3D-organotypic invasion assay. 5 \u00d7 104 TIF fibroblasts/sample were first embedded into a neutralized collagen I solution and incubated for 3 days. Then 1 \u00d7 105 HT1080-GFP cells were seeded on the matrices, grown for 2 days (T0) and let to invade for 3 or 6 days. Matrices were then processed as described in Section 4.14. (B) Representative images of matrices sections after DAPI staining, 20\u00d7 magnification, Scale bar, 50 \u00b5m. Fibroblasts were processed as described in (A), in the absence of Pep 2 (NT). Duplicate samples were exposed to 100 nM Pep 2 during HT1080-GFP invasion (Pep 2 invasion) or to 100 nM Pep 1 or Pep 2 during matrix contraction (Pep 1 contraction, Pep 2 contraction) and then peptides were removed and the matrices washed twice with growth medium. During contraction or invasion peptides were added to matrices every day. (C) The number of invading cells was quantified by densitometric analysis of images shown in B, with ImageJ software, the number of HT1080-GFP invading cells on untreated matrices was normalized to T0 and the 3 days sample was considered as 100%. (D) 5 \u00d7 104 TIF fibroblasts were seeded in DMEM-10% FBS in 6 well plates for 24 h, serum-starved for 6 h and incubated for 24 h in presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides in DMEM-10%FBS. Peptides were then removed and, after two PBS 1\u00d7 washes, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. Conditioned media (CM) from TIFs exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as a chemoattractants for H1080-GFP cells in Boyden chamber migration assays.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Thus, our findings suggest that targeting CXCR4 could provide some therapeutic interest for HER2 BC patients, whereas it has no impact or could even be detrimental for TN BC patients.IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) remains the most frequent cancer and the major cause of cancer-associated death in women. Based on histopathological analysis commonly used in clinical practice, BC has been identified as a heterogeneous disease classified into three main subtypes: Luminal (Lum), HER2 and triple-negative (TN), which have been further confirmed and extended by gene expression profiling. Lum BC are positive for estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor, LumB exhibiting high mitotic index compared with LumA. HER2 BC are characterized by the amplification of the ERBB2 oncogene and TN BC are negative for ER, progesterone receptor and ERBB2. This BC patient stratification has proven some efficacy in identifying appropriate treatments, especially in Lum and HER2 BC patients. Indeed, endocrine (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) and targeted (trastuzumab) therapies have provided significant improvements in treating Lum and HER2 tumors, respectively. Nevertheless, further progresses are still needed, in particular for HER2 and TN molecular subtypes, which are responsible of the worse clinical outcomes. In these patients disease progression is characterized by accumulation of distant metastases in TN and by axillary lymph-node metastases in HER2 BC subtypes. Furthermore, owing to the increase in resistance to Herceptin or to the anti-proliferative agent Paclitaxel, HER2 and TN subtypes require innovative treatments.CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1) and its receptor CXCR4 have essential roles in hematopoiesis: they regulate hematopoietic stem cells homing in bone marrow and lymphocytes trafficking to sites of inflammation. At the normal state, CXCR4 is found at the surface of most leukocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells. In cancer, CXCR4 is expressed in many types of solid tumors including breast, prostate, brain, colon and lung. Moreover, CXCR4 surface expression is an independent prognostic factor for disease relapse and survival in BC. Previous studies have assessed efficacy of targeting CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway on breast primary tumor growth and metastasis using syngenic models or various human breast cancer cell lines. Still, the therapeutic interest of targeting CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in the different BC subtypes remained unclear. In that sense, we have previously shown that CXCR4 protein accumulates in both HER2 and TN invasive BC, compared with LumA BC subtype. We also demonstrated that CXCL12 protein staining was strongly upregulated in the stroma of HER2 patients. This chemokine, mostly produced by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, enhances tumor growth through mechanisms such as proliferation, survival, migration and drug resistance. Moreover, CXCL12 strongly modifies tumor microenvironment by promoting angiogenesis through hypoxia-induced CXCR4 expression and recruitment of endothelial progenitors. In addition, CXCR4 signaling, in response to CXCL12, mediates actin polymerization and pseudopodia formation thus inducing chemotactic and invasive responses toward CXCL12-enriched organs. Increased CXCR4 expression has been reported as a poor prognostic indicator in patients with HER2 BC. All these tumor and metastasis-promoting functions of CXCL12/CXCR4 make this ligand-receptor association appealing for new therapeutic avenues, in particular in BC.Given the crucial role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in tumor microenvironment, we investigated if targeting this signaling pathway could be of potential therapeutic interest in invasive BC. In contrast to previous CXCR4 BC studies using subcutaneous xenograft models or transgenic mouse models, BC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models maintain cell differentiation, morphology, architecture, and molecular signatures of original patient tumors. In the present study, we observed that the stromal compartment of BC PDX reproduces finely the stroma of the human tumors, indicating PDX are suitable models for investigating the efficacy of stroma-targeting drugs in BC patients. Taking advantage of these conserved properties, we investigated whether two CXCR4 inhibitors, a small molecule inhibitor bicyclam AMD3100 (that is, Plerixafor) and a small peptide antagonist TN14003, were able to modulate tumor growth and metastases of invasive HER2 and TN BC, the two BC subtypes that have still medical needs. Although both inhibitors impair CXCL12 interaction with its receptor, TN14003 behaves as an inverse agonist, while AMD3100 is a partial agonist. Here, we demonstrated that the two CXCR4 inhibitors significantly reduced tumor growth of several independent HER2 PDX tumors, including Herceptin- and Docetaxel-resistant model, suggesting that CXCR4 inhibition could be useful as a third line of treatment for HER2 patients. In contrast, CXCR4 inhibitors were not able to reduce tumor growth of TN PDX models and could even increase metastatic spread in 25% cases, all being characterized by high CXCL12 expression in lung metastasis. In conclusion, by using adapted representative models derived from invasive BC patients, this work demonstrates, for the first time, that CXCR4 inhibitors are of therapeutic interest for HER2 patients, whereas they could be detrimental and promote lung metastasis in TN BC.ResultsPDX models recapitulate CXCL12 expression and stromal properties of human BCWe and others have previously shown that CXCL12/CXCR4-dependent axis is significantly upregulated in human HER2 BC compared with both aggressive TN and good prognosis LumA subtypes. To further investigate the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway in HER2 BC subtype, we sought to identify relevant preclinical models and considered PDX, as these xenograft models have been shown to reproduce properties of the human tumors they derived from. Still, neither stromal properties nor expression of CXCR4/CXCL12 had been previously characterized in PDX models derived from human BC. Interestingly, we had access to 15 PDX from the different BC subtypes, including 5 Lum, 3 HER2 and 7 TN BC. We first observed that the myofibroblast content, evaluated by histological scoring of smooth-muscle actin (SMA) immunostaining, was significantly elevated in PDX derived from both HER2 and TN BC, compared with LumA BC (Figures 1a and b). These results were completely consistent with previous observations made on human BC, where the myofibroblasts content was much higher in HER2 and TN BC than in LumA BC. We thus validated that stromal fibroblasts turn into myofibroblasts in HER2 and TN PDX, but remain in an inactivated state (that is, SMA-negative) in LumA PDX, as detected in human tumors. Similarly, we observed that expression of the CXCR4 receptor was significantly increased in both HER2 and TN PDX compared with LumA PDX (Figures 1a and c). Furthermore, the CXCL12 chemokine accumulated strongly in the stroma of HER2 PDX, compared with TN and LumA PDX (Figures 1a and d). Here again, CXCR4/CXCL12 expression patterns in PDX were reminiscent of those previously reported in human BC. Finally, considering histological scores established from tumors of all BC subtypes (LumA, HER2 and TN), high expression of CXCL12 was correlated with myofibroblast accumulation in PDX models (Figure 1e), similarly as in human BC, in particular in the HER2 context. In conclusion, PDX models of BC fully recapitulate stromal properties as those observed in human BC, making them models of choice for studying anti-CXCR4-targeted therapies.Blocking CXCR4 receptor significantly reduces tumor growth and metastases in PDX of the HER2 BC subtypeAMD3100 and TN14003 are two well-known CXCR4 inhibitors, which have been previously tested in xenograft models obtained by subcutaneous injection of cancer cell lines. However, efficiency of these CXCR4 inhibitors has never been evaluated in PDX, whereas these models are fully representative of the corresponding human BC in terms of stromal properties and CXCR4/CXCL12 expression. To evaluate antitumor efficiency of CXCR4 inhibition in these models, AMD3100 and TN14003 were administrated into independent PDX models, established from different patients of the HER2 subtype and analyzed for stromal content and CXCR4/CXCL12 expression pattern, as shown above in Figure 1. These models were here after referred to as HER2-BC1 (Figure 2a) and HER2-BC2 (Figure 2b), with the HER2-BC3 being further analyzed in the next part of the results (see below). TN14003 significantly reduced both tumor volume (Figures 2a and b, Left panels) and final tumor weight (Figures 2a and b, Right panels) in the two HER2 models. Similarly, AMD3100 significantly reduced tumor weight in the two HER2 PDX models (Figures 2a and b, Right panels), but decreased tumor volume only in HER2-BC2 model, suggesting that the inverse agonist TN14003 was more efficient than the partial agonist AMD3100. We next analyzed the impact of CXCR4 inhibitors on metastatic spread in the HER2-BC1 PDX model, where lung metastases were observed. Of note, it has been established previously that there was a predilection for lung metastases in these PDX models, with no detection of metastatic spread in liver, bone or brain. All along this work, we thus concentrated our analyses on lung metastases. We evaluated metastatic spread by using a sensitive method quantifying human ALU sequences and detecting both macro- and micro-metastases (Figures 2c\u2013e). We observed that HER2-BC1 mice treated with TN14003 tended to exhibit less metastasis than the untreated control group (Figures 2d and e). Indeed, although not significant when analyzed per subgroup owing to large amplitude from one animal to another (Figure 2d), the difference in lung metastases between controls and TN14003-treated animals was significant when analyzed per individual (Figure 2e). In contrast, although we detected a similar tendency, AMD3100 did not significantly inhibit metastatic dissemination of tumor cells into lungs, confirming that TN14003 was more efficient than AMD3100 in this model. Thus, results based both on tumor growth and distant metastases in suitable HER2 PDX models confirmed that the use of CXCR4 inhibitors could be of some interest for treatment of HER2 BC patients.Anti-CXCR4 drugs inhibit HER2 tumor growth by reducing both angiogenesis and myofibroblast contentHaving established that CXCR4 inhibitors were efficient in decreasing tumorigenesis in HER2 PDX, we next investigated how those inhibitors could impede tumor growth. First, we verified that CXCR4 phosphorylation was significantly impaired by both AMD3100 and TN14003 (Figure 3a). Indeed, as expected, AMD3100 and TN14003 reduced the ratio of the phosphorylated CXCR4 isoform to its total isoform (P-CXCR4/CXCR4) by 44% and 51%, respectively (Figure 3b). As high levels of CXCL12 have been reported to attract tumor cells, we next wondered if blocking CXCR4 receptor by using specific inhibitors could in turn modulate CXCL12 levels but we did not observe any variation of CXCL12 expression at tumor site (Supplementary Figure 1a) or at distant lung metastatic site (Supplementary Figure 1b) in the presence of AMD3100 or TN14003. CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway has been shown previously to activate tumor cell proliferation but is also well known for its impact on tumor microenvironment by promoting conversion of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and stimulating angiogenesis. We thus focused our study on three markers: KI67, SMA and endothelial cell adhesion marker (CD31), in order to evaluate tumor cell proliferation rate, myofibroblast content and angiogenic spread, respectively. Those markers were tested in two different HER2 models, HER2-BC1 (Figure 3c) and HER2-BC2 (Supplementary Figure 2a). In the two HER2 PDX models, CXCR4 inhibitors led to a decrease in both myofibroblast and blood vessel contents, as shown by SMA and CD31 staining (Figures 3c and d and Supplementary Figures 2a and b). Indeed, SMA staining was reduced by at least 71% after treatment by the two CXCR4 inhibitors in both HER2-BC1 (Figure 3d, Left) and HER2-BC2 (Supplementary Figures 2a and b, Left). Moreover, CD31 staining was diminished by 66 and 77% with AMD3100, and by 63 and 79% with TN14003 in HER2-BC1 (Figures 3c and d, Middle) and HER2-BC2 (Supplementary Figures 2a and b, Middle). Conversely, we did not observe any difference in Ki67 staining between untreated mouse subgroups (control; CTL) and AMD3100- or TN14003-treated subgroups in the two HER2 PDX models tested (Figures 3c and d, Right and Supplementary Figures 2a and b, Right). Of note, in HER2-BC1 model, Ki67 staining was higher in AMD3100-treated group than in TN14003-treated group (Figure 3d right panel). This difference could explain\u2014at least in part\u2014why AMD3100 was less efficient than TN14003 in tumor growth inhibition in this model (as shown above, Figure 2a, left panel). Finally, the rate of cancer cell apoptosis playing a key role in treatment response, we evaluated it by the ratio between cleaved Caspase 3 to total Caspase 3 protein levels (Figures 3e and f). We observed that apoptosis was not increased in AMD3100- or in TN14003-treated tumors, compared with phosphate-buffered saline-treated ones (CTL) (Figures 3e and f). Taken together, these observations confirmed that CXCR4 inhibitors act mainly in a tumor cell non-autonomous manner by modulating tumor microenvironment, including both myofibroblast and blood vessel density.Finally, CXCL12 has a crucial role in the regulation of trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells and their homing in bone marrow. Moreover, AMD3100 has been shown to be effective for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into peripheral blood circulation. To analyze if these inhibitors had any impact on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in HER2 PDX, we performed a complete blood count of control-, AMD3100- or TN14003-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 1c). Even if we observed a certain tendency for a decrease in the total number of white blood cells following AMD3100 and TN14003 treatments, no significant difference was noted in the repartition of lymphocytes, monocytes or neutrophils/granulocytes (Supplementary Figure 1c). We also analyzed the content of hematopoietic cells within tumors by flow cytometry, after achieving mechanic and enzymatic dissociation of HER2 PDX tumors (Supplementary Figure 1d). Here again, we did not detect any significant change in the percentage of granulocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages or monocytes between tumors from controls or from mice treated with CXCR4 inhibitors. Together, our results suggest that tumor growth inhibition of HER2 PDX by CXCR4 inhibitors is mainly associated with modifications in its tumor microenvironment, including reduced myofibroblast content and impaired angiogenesis but not with hematopoietic changes.CXCR4 inhibitors could be beneficial for HER2 patients, who are resistant to HerceptinHerceptin-based therapy is routinely used for HER2-positive BC and often combined with cytotoxic agents. Nevertheless, some resistances to this targeted treatment were demonstrated linked to various mechanisms, including accumulation of HER2 truncated isoforms, loss of phosphatase PTEN, activating mutations of PIK3CA or stimulation of downstream signaling pathway through alternative tyrosine kinase receptors, such as HER4. We thus wondered if activation of CXCR4 receptor could also participate in resistance to Herceptin and Docetaxel. If true, resistance to these drugs should be\u2013at least in part\u2014alleviated by blocking CXCR4. To test this hypothesis, we studied the impact of TN14003 (revealed above as the most efficient anti-CXCR4 drug) combined to Trastuzumab and Docetaxel on HER2-BC3 PDX model and previously identified as resistant to these treatments. As shown in Figure 4, we confirmed that combination of Herceptin and Docetaxel had no significant impact on relative tumor volume (RTV) and final tumor weight in this model (Figures 4a and b). Administration of TN14003 alone into HER2-BC3 PDX reduced tumor growth and tumor weight (Figures 4a and b), demonstrating that the CXCR4 receptor remain active in Herceptin-resistant HER2 BC. Association of TN14003 to Herceptin and Docetaxel treatment reached a tumor growth inhibition scaled to the control group of 98% (Figure 4c), suggesting that inhibiting CXCR4 could represent a therapeutic interest in chemoresistant HER2 BC. In addition, at least 50% tumor growth inhibition was observed in 7 cases out of 11 animals treated with the combination of the three drugs, whereas this proportion was significantly lower when each drug was administered alone (Figure 4d). Taken together, these observations suggest that CXCR4 inhibition could be a new suitable therapeutic avenue for Herceptin-resistant HER2 BC patients.The use of CXCR4 inhibitors is not efficient for growth inhibition in TN BC and even promotes metastatic spread in 25% casesIn addition to HER2 BC, we found that CXCL12 and CXCR4 proteins accumulate in TN BC PDX, compared with LumA subtype (as shown above, Figures 1a and c). TN BC patients exhibit a poor survival rate, with half of them developing resistance to chemotherapy and disease recurrence. New treatments for TN BC patients thus remain a real challenge and better therapeutic tools are urgently required. In order to evaluate the potential interest of CXCR4 inhibitors for treatment of TN BC patients, AMD3100 and TN14003 were administrated in three TN PDX models, selected according to high expression of CXCR4 receptor at epithelial cell surface (as described Figure 1). These models were next referred to as TN-BC1, TN-BC2 and TN-BC3 (Figure 5). The two CXCR4 inhibitors had no effect on tumor growth of the three TN BC PDX models tested (Figures 5a\u2013c), suggesting that blocking CXCR4 is not of therapeutic interest for TN BC. Consistently, whereas myofibroblast content assessed by SMA staining was reduced by anti-CXCR4 treatments, no significant difference was detected for proliferative or angiogenic markers (Ki67 and CD31, respectively) in the three TN PDX models in response to CXCR4 inhibitors (Supplementary Figures 3b\u2013d). We next analyzed the impact of CXCR4 inhibitors on metastases (Figures 5d\u2013h). Whereas TN-BC1 exhibited high number of lung metastases, when assessed by pathologists, no metastasis and low rate of lung metastases were detected in TN-BC2 and TN-BC3 PDX, respectively (Figure 5d). These observations were previously reported using the same mouse models and were reminiscent of the patient status these PDX derived from. We thus focused our further analyses on TN-BC1, the only TN PDX where metastases developed at high frequency (Figures 5e\u2013h). Quite surprisingly, we observed that mice treated with AMD3100 or TN14003 tended to have more metastasis than the untreated group (Figure 5e and Supplementary Figure 3a). This tendency was highly variable from one mouse to another and major differences were noted in some specific mice (Figure 5f). In this TN model with high metastatic potential, we observed a strong accumulation of lung metastases in 5 animals among 20 mice treated either with AMD3100 or TN14003, compared with the untreated group (Figure 5f). Interestingly, we observed a significantly higher CXCL12 mRNA levels in lungs of mice with high rate of metastases compared with mice with low rate of metastases, following anti-CXCR4 treatment (Figure 5g). In contrast, there was no difference in CXCL12 expression in tumors in these different animals (Figure 5h). CXCL12 expression was evaluated at RNA levels as these experiments gave reproducible and reliable data. Taken as a whole, these data show that blocking CXCR4 in TN BC do not lead to any tumor growth inhibition and can even increase metastatic spread in 25% cases, effect that is associated with high lung CXCL12 expression. Considering that CXCR4 inhibitors are either inefficient or could even exacerbate the pathology, our work suggest that administration of anti-CXCR4 is not recommended as a potential therapy for TN patients.DiscussionIn our work, we took advantage of BC PDX models that faithfully recapitulate stromal components of human tumors to investigate the efficacy of CXCR4-targeting drugs. Although CXCL12/CXCR4 proteins accumulate in both HER2 and TN BC, we observe that CXCR4 inhibitors efficiently impair tumorigenesis in HER2 PDX but not in TN PDX, where they can even increase metastatic spread. Our data thus highlight that targeting the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis does not exhibit the same therapeutic interest for the different BC subtypes. Although the use of anti-CXCR4 is inefficient and could even be detrimental for TN BC patient, blocking CXCR4 could represent a genuine promising therapeutic strategy for HER2 BC, in particular for herceptin-resistant patients.It is well established that in response to its ligand CXCL12, CXCR4-mediated signaling is important in BC. Indeed, although expression of CXCR4 is very low or absent in normal breast tissue, expression levels increase from atypical ductal hyperplasia to in situ ductal carcinoma and to invasive cancer. Moreover, myofibroblast stromal cells adjacent to primary breast tumors exhibit much higher CXCL12 expression than fibroblasts in normal breast tissue. Through paracrine signaling, CXCR4 promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival, as well as tumor angiogenesis. Previous studies have evaluated the impact of CXCR4 inhibitors in BC in syngeneic models using 4T1 murine cells or in xenografts with human BC cells injected subcutaneously, intravenously or orthotopically into the fat pad. In those models, the stromal compartment is not properly represented (quantitatively and qualitatively) due to the hyperproliferation of cancer cells. As CXCL12 is mainly produced by stromal fibroblasts, we sought to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CXCR4 inhibition in appropriated preclinical models of human BC. To do so, we considered PDX models, which fully recapitulate stromal and epithelial properties of human tumors and test the efficiency of two CXCR4 inhibitors: a small molecule inhibitor bicyclam AMD3100 (that is, Plerixafor) and a peptide antagonist TN14003. Even though both inhibitors reduce significantly CXCR4 phosphorylation, we found that TN14003 has a stronger impact than AMD3100 on tumor growth inhibition in HER2 PDX. This could be explained by the fact that TN14003, derived from T140 product, acts as an inverse CXCR4 agonist, whereas AMD3100 displays partial agonist activity. Still, using these inhibitors, we observe a significant reduction of tumor growth and metastatic spread in HER2 PDX. Similarly, a peptide inhibitor of CXCR4, CTCE-9908, also inhibits metastatic spread in a model of PyMT mammary tumors that overexpress the HER2/neu oncogene. Although we show that blocking CXCR4 represents a suitable treatment for HER2 BC, in particular for Herceptin/Docetaxel-resistant patients, our study is the first to provide compelling evidence that inhibiting CXCR4 is not beneficial and could even be detrimental for TN BC patients. In contrast, silencing CXCR4 expression using siRNA or neutralizing CXCR4 with a antibody or TN14003 inhibitor have been shown to decrease TN BC cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. But, all these studies were performed by using TN BC cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231, as system model. On the opposite, using relevant preclinical models, we demonstrate that CXCR4 inhibitors do not impair tumor growth in TN BC and can even exacerbate metastasis, arguing this treatment should be avoided in these patients.We show here that CXCR4 inhibition does not modulate tumor cell proliferation in any of the HER2 and TN PDX models tested, suggesting that tumor growth inhibition in HER2 BC following anti-CXCR4 administration is not due to a tumor cell-autonomous effect. CXCL12 is highly secreted by stromal fibroblasts and the presence of myofibroblasts has been correlated with poor prognosis in invasive BC. We thus first hypothesized that inhibiting CXCL12/CXCR4 axis could modulate the myofibroblastic composition of the stroma. Accordingly, we find that the myofibroblast content is severely affected following CXCR4 inhibition in all models analyzed. However, myofibroblast content is reduced after treatment even in TN PDX models in which tumor growth is not affected, arguing that the impact of anti-CXCR4 on tumor stroma is not sufficient to inhibit tumor growth. CXCL12-dependent tumor cell migration has also been associated to macrophages and their cross-talk with tumor cells. Even if our models were transplanted into immuno-compromised nude murine hosts (mainly affected into T-cell differentiation), we do not see any variation in hematopoietic cell composition in peripheral blood circulation or in tumors, in the presence of CXCR4 inhibitors. Finally, it has been suggested that the chemokine CXCL12 enhances tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis through recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells into the tumor mass. In agreement with these observations, we observed that the use of both CXCR4 inhibitors leads to a strong decrease in tumor angiogenesis in HER2 PDX models, but not in TN PDX models, suggesting that this is through their anti-angiogenic potential that CXCR4 inhibitors reduce significantly tumorigenesis in HER2 PDX. Indeed, there is a strong parallel between tumor growth inhibition and anti-angiogenic effects in PDX models: although being inefficient in inhibiting tumor growth and angiogenesis in TN PDX, anti-CXCR4 are able to reduce both processes in HER2 PDX. Altogether, these data suggest that inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling significantly impairs tumor angiogenesis in HER2 BC that subsequently reduces tumor growth.In conclusion, our findings provide the first demonstration for the dichotomy of anti-CXCR4 treatment interest between HER2 and TN BC subtypes. This could be of particular interest for HER2 patients resistant to conventional treatments, such as Trastuzumab and taxanes. On the opposite, our results argue that administration of CXCR4 inhibitors should be proscribed for treatment of TN BC patients.Materials and methodsEstablishment of breast cancer PDXThe projects developed here are based on surgical residual tumor tissues available after histopathological analyses that are not needed for diagnostic purposes. There is no interference with the clinical practice. Breast cancer PDX were established at Institut Curie (Paris, France) with patient consent, as described previously, according to the relevant national law on the protection of people taking part in biomedical research. All patients were informed by their referring oncologists that their biological samples could be used for research purposes and they gave their verbal informed consent. In case of patient refusal, that could be either orally expressed or written, residual tumor samples were not used in our study. The Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee of the Institut Curie Hospital Group approved all analyses realized in this study. HER2-amplified carcinomas have been defined according to ERBB2 immunostaining using ASCO's guideline. LumA tumors were defined by positive immunostaining for ER and/or progesterone receptor. The cutoff used to define hormone receptor positivity was 10% of stained cells. The TN immunophenotype was defined as follows: ER\u2212PR\u2212 ERBB2\u2212 with the expression of at least one of the following markers: KRT5/6+, EGF-R+, Kit+. For PDX models, tumor patients' surgical fragments of 30\u201360 mm3 were grafted into the interscapular fat pad of 6-week-old female Swiss nude mice, under avertin anesthesia and maintained through in vivo passages. Interestingly, we had access to 15 previously described PDX, including five Lum, three HER2 and seven TN BC models. We first investigated CXCR4 and CXCL12 protein levels, as well as stromal content, in these models, as shown in Figure 1. We next selected representative HER2 (HER2-BC1, 2 and 3) and TN (TN-BC1, 2 and 3) PDX models with high CXCR4 expression at the surface of epithelial cells, for evaluating efficiency of CXCR4 inhibitors. Different models of invasive BC, previously described, were used in our study: HBCx-5 at two distinct passages at more than 1 year apart (HER2-BC1 and HER2-BC3), HBCx-12 (TN-BC1), HBCx-13 (HER2-BC2), HBCx-14 (TN-BC3) and HBCx-24 (TN-BC2). When tumors reached a volume of 40\u2013120 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to each group, and the treatments were started. Herceptin (Trastuzumab, Roche, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) (10\u2009mg/kg) diluted in 0.9% NaCl and Docetaxel (Taxotere, Sanofi, Gentilly, France) (20\u2009mg/kg) diluted in its specific excipient, were administered by the intraperitoneal route at, respectively, 1- or 3-week intervals. AMD3100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France, A5602) and TN14003 (synthesized by Bachem Company, Bubendorf, Switzerland) were given intraperitonealy 5 consecutive days each week, at a dose of 7.5\u2009mg/kg. CTL mice have been treated similarly by injection of phosphate-buffered saline solution (100\u2009\u03bcl). Then, tumor growth was evaluated by measurement of two perpendicular diameters of tumors with a caliper three times per week. Individual tumor volumes were calculated as V=a \u00d7 b2/2, with a being the major diameter and b the minor diameter. For each tumor, the tumor volume at day n (Vn) was reported as the initial volume before inclusion in the experiment (V0) and expressed as RTV according to the following formula: RTV=Vn/V0. Means and s.e.m of RTV in the same treatment group were calculated, and growth curves were established as a function of time. For each condition and individual mouse, tumor growth inhibition was scaled to the tumor growth inhibition mean of the control group and calculated using the following formula: 100\u2212100 \u00d7 (RTV from untreated mice/RTV from treated mice). Animals were chosen in a randomized manner within each subgroup. For each condition, the sample size calculation was performed using \u2018InvivoStat' software (http://invivostat.co.uk). The number of mice analyzed in each experiment is indicated in the corresponding Figure legend. Analyses were not performed under blinded conditions. All protocols involving mice and animal housing were in accordance with institutional guidelines as proposed by the French Ethics Committee and have been approved (Agreement number: CEEA-IC #118: 2013-06).Western blot and densitometry analysisTumors incubated for 5\u2009min with lysis buffer (50\u2009mm TrisHCl pH6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 2\u2009mm DTT, 2.5\u2009mm EDTA, 2.5\u2009mm EGTA, 4\u2009mm Na3VO4, 20\u2009mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, #05 056 489 001). Two stainless balls (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France, #69989) were added and the tubes were inserted in a tissue lyser for 3\u2009min at 30\u2009Hz. Then, after a 10\u2009min incubation step at 100\u2009\u00b0C, extracts were centrifuged at 1\u200930\u2009000\u2009g for 15\u2009min at room temperature, and the protein lysates from supernatants were collected. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce Laboratories, ThermoFisher Scientific, Illkirch, France, #23225). For each sample, an equal amount of total proteins was diluted in sample buffer (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France, #1610747) and boiled for 5\u2009min. Samples were loaded onto cast 10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, #4561033). After electrophoresis proteins were transferred to a 0.2\u2009\u03bcm nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Whatman, Fisher Scientific, Illkirch, France, #10 401 396). Membranes were then blotted overnight with the appropriate first antibodies at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: E-cadherin (1:1000, BD Biosciences, Paris, France, #610181), Ser339-CXCR4 (1:500, Abcam, #ab74012), CXCR4 (1:500, Abcam, Paris, France, #ab93478), Caspase 3 (1/5000; Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, The Netherlands, #9662), Cleaved Caspase 3 (1/1000; Cell Signaling Technology, #9661). Specific binding of antibodies was detected using appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Europe, Suffolk, UK, #115-035-003 and 115-035-045) and was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Western Lightning Plus-ECL, PerkinElmer, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). Densitometric analyses of immunoblots were performed using Multi Gauge software (FujiFilm, Bois d'Arcy, France).ImmunohistochemistryFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections (3\u2009\u03bcm) from PDX were stained using streptavidin-peroxidase protocol, the Lab Vision Autostainer 480 (ThermoFisher Scientific) as previously described in. In brief, paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with specific antibodies recognizing smooth-muscle alpha-actin, SMA (1/250, Dako, Les Ulis, France, #M0851), Ki67 (1/100, Dako, #M7240), CD31 (1/100, Abcam, #ab28364), CXCL12 (1/100, Abcam, #ab9797) and CXCR4 (1/50, Abcam, #ab2074) in phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 7.6 containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1\u2009h, following unmasking in 1 \u00d7 Tris/EDTA buffer, pH 9 (Dako, #S2367) for 20\u2009min at 97\u2009\u00b0C. For PDX screening quantification, histological score (Hscore) was given as a function of the percentage of positive cells multiplied by the staining intensity (ranging from 0 to 4) in at least five representative pictures (\u00d7 10 fields) from at least five animals per subgroup of treatment. Drugs comparisons groups quantifications were performed by two independent investigators using ImageJ software. In brief, color deconvolution was achieved for the separation of Haematoxilin (blue) or specific staining (revealed by DAB coloration, brown) channels alone. A threshold was run on the DAB channel and a mask was applied in order to isolate the specific signal coming from brown channel. Then, the percentage of stained area was evaluated, and a mean for each animal was calculated. Lung sections (4\u2009\u2009\u03bcm) were stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin\u2013safranin according to standard histological procedures. A metastatic score was evaluated by a pathologist, based on the size (ranging from 0 to 3) and the number (ranging from 0 to 3) of lung metastases. Metastatic score was completed with an evaluation of micro-metastasesALUseq Q-PCRFor lung metastasis detection in PDX, the real-time PCR allows the detection of human RNA in mouse tissues (see also ref. for detailed description of the method). The presence of human cells within the host organ was quantified by mean of the transcript of human genes highly and exclusively represented in the human genome (Alu sequences). This method applied to PDX models greatly enhances the sensitivity of detection of invading human cells within lung tissues. Alu transcripts were considered to be detectable and quantifiable when the Ct value was below 35, and not detectable when the Ct value was above 35. The primers used for detection of Alu sequence were the following: 5\u2032-TCACACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032.Statistical analysisDifferences between groups were considered statistically significant at values of P\u2a7d0.05. Graphs generally represent means\u00b1s.e.m obtained from independent experiments using adapted statistical test, as mentioned in each legend of the figures. The horizontal dark line on the scatter plots represents the mean and the error bars the s.e.m. Spearman's correlation test was used to evaluate the correlation coefficient between two parameters. Statistical tests used are in agreement with data distribution: Normality was first checked using the Shapiro\u2013Wilk test and parametric or non-parametric test was applied according to normality respect. When normal distribution was observed, equality of variances was then tested using Bartlett's test. If variances between groups were similar, Student's t-test was performed, otherwise Welsh's t-test was applied. Statistical tests have been indicated and justified, when necessary. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 software.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on the Oncogene website (http://www.nature.com/onc)The authors declare no conflict of interest.Gene expression patterns of breast carcinomas distinguish tumor subclasses with clinical implicationsMolecular portraits of human breast tumoursA highly efficacious lymphocyte chemoattractant, stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)Molecular cloning and characterization of a murine pre-B-cell growth-stimulating factor/stromal cell-derived factor 1 receptor, a murine homolog of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 entry coreceptor fusinTransgene expression study of CXCR4 active mutants.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

The fibroblasts were indicated as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), normal zone fibroblasts (NFs) and interface zone fibroblasts (INFs). Our study found that INFs grew significantly faster than NFs and CAFs in vitro. The epithelial BT20 cells cultured with the conditioned medium of INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM). These results indicated that factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in BT20 cells. Using an in vitro co-culture model, INFs or CAFs induced EMT and promoted cancer cell migration in BT20 cells. Interestingly, we found that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells. Previous studies reported that CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promoted human breast cancer cell proliferation, here; our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in BT20 cells. Pretreatment with emodin significantly suppressed the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT and cell migration in BT20 cells. These results suggest that emodin may be used as a novel agent for the treatment of TNBC.",

Interestingly, we found that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells. Previous studies reported that CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promoted human breast cancer cell proliferation, here; our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in BT20 cells. Pretreatment with emodin significantly suppressed the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT and cell migration in BT20 cells. These results suggest that emodin may be used as a novel agent for the treatment of TNBC.IntroductionBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and affects the lives of millions of women worldwide each year. The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

In this study, we further underlying the epigenetic mechanisms of CAFs feed the cancer cells and the molecular mediators involved in these processes. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with CAFs culture conditioned medium, respectively. Cytokine antibody array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to identify the key chemokines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay were performed to explore the transactivation of target LncRNA by CAFs.

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs(A) Collagen contraction assay. Shown are representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (no treatment [NT]) after 24 h. (B) Histogram of mean collagen plug areas for NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT, measured with ImageJ. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed with three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3).

(C) Migration assay performed with NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 24h (+exosomes) or PBS (NT).

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.039. (E) Histogram of quantitative real-time PCR showing FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNA relative expression in NFs\u00a0+ exosomes over NT. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

(B) Histograms of qRT-PCR results showing the expression levels of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with exosomes compared with NT. Data are shown as relative expression of the miRNAs. Standard deviations were calculated on technical duplicates. The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027).

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0049. (E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

Large amount of data indicate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which constitute the major component of the tumor stroma, actively participate in tumor cells proliferation and spread. Indeed, it has been shown that human breast cells produced significantly faster growing tumors when mixed with CAFs than when mixed with normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, co-injection of lethally irradiated fibroblasts or inclusion of fibroblast-conditioned medium (CM) with breast cancer cell grafts increased carcinogenesis and tumor growth, indicating that activated fibroblasts promote tumor growth by secreting soluble factors. Indeed, Orimo et al. have clearly shown that stromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) secretion. Several other chemokines, growth factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are secreted by stromal fibroblasts and their secretion increases when these fibroblasts are activated.,  However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the secretion of these chemotactic factors are still obscure.p16INK4A (hereafter referred to as p16) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that has multiple biological functions, including the inhibition of cell cycle progression, and the induction of senescence. The tumor suppressor functions of p16 have been extensively studied in tumor cells, paying only little attention to its potential cell nonautonomous effects from the surrounding stromal cells, including fibroblasts.The presented data clearly show that in addition to its well-known cell autonomous tumor suppressor functions, p16 has also a major cell nonautonomous tumor inhibitory role.Resultsp16 is downregulated in breast cancer-associated stromal fibroblastsThe p16 expression was first investigated in 12 human breast CAFs and their counterpart fibroblasts isolated from histologicaly normal cancer-free tissues (TCFs). CAF/TCF pairs were always used simultaneously at similar passages. Whole-cell extracts were prepared and specific anti-p16 and anti-GAPDH (used as internal control) antibodies were utilized for immunoblotting analysis. Figures 1a and b show that the level of p16 is lower in 10 out of 12 CAFs (83%) as compared with their corresponding TCFs. However, p16 level was similar in 2 CAF/TCF pairs 114 and 148 (Figures 1a and b). In addition, a great interindividual variation in p16 expression was observed between the various CAFs and also TCFs (Figures 1a and b).The level of the CDKN2A mRNA was also assessed in the same cells by reverse transcription (RT)\u2013PCR. Therefore, total RNA was prepared and specific primers for CDKN2A as well as \u03b2-actin (used as internal control) were utilized for amplification. Figures 1c and d show a clear decrease in the CDKN2A mRNA level in 10 out of 12 (83%) CAFs, as compared with their adjacent TCFs, while CDKN2A mRNA was similar in the two CAF/TCF pairs 114 and 148. These results were confirmed for some CAF/TCF pairs with quantitative RT\u2013PCR (data not shown). This shows that the expression of the CDKN2A mRNA reflects that of the corresponding protein in the majority of the TCF/CAF pairs (Figures 1b and d), indicating that the decrease in p16 protein level is due, at least in part, to a decrease in the level of its corresponding transcript.To provide evidence that p16 downregulation in CAFs is also taking place in breast tissues, frozen sections including both tumor and their adjacent normal tissues were double immunostained by fluorescent anti-p16 and anti-vimentin (fibroblast cells marker) antibodies. Figure 1e shows lower positive staining for p16 in fibroblasts present in tumors than in their counterparts present in normal parts. This indicates that p16 is also downregulated in CAFs in vivo.The CDKN2A mRNA turnover is faster in CAFs versus TCFsNext, we sought to study the CDKN2A mRNA half-life in the TCF/CAF-180 pair. To this end, cells were treated with the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) for different periods of time. Subsequently, total RNA was purified and quantified by RT\u2013PCR using specific primers for CDKN2A and \u03b2-actin. Figure 2a shows that the CDKN2A mRNA is more stable in TCF cells as compared with their corresponding CAFs. Indeed, while the CDKN2A mRNA half-life is >6\u2009h in TCF-180, it is only 45\u2009min in CAF-180 (Figure 2a). Similar results were obtained for other CAF/TCF pairs (data not shown), which strongly suggests that the lower level of the CDKN2A mRNA in CAFs is due to its faster turnover in these cells as compared with their adjacent counterparts.The level of the AUF1 protein is higher in CAFs than in TCFsTo explore the cause of the CDKN2A mRNA instability in CAFs, we assessed the level of the RNA decay-promoting protein AUF1, which is known to regulate the RNA stability of the CDKN2A mRNA, by immunoblotting. To this end, cell extracts from the 12 CAF/TCF pairs, and specific anti-AUF1 as well as anti-GAPDH antibodies were used. Figure 2c shows that the AUF1 protein (46\u2009kDa band) is clearly upregulated in 8 out of 12 CAFs (66%) as compared with their corresponding TCFs. Importantly, the CDKN2A mRNA was downregulated in all CAFs were AUF1 was found highly expressed (Figures 1d and 2c).To further elucidate the link between AUF1 and p16 downregulation in CAFs, we tested the effect of AUF1 knockdown using specific siRNA on the expression level of the CDKN2A mRNA in CAF-64. Therefore, these cells were transfected with plasmids harboring either AUF1-siRNA or control siRNA for 24\u2009h, and then cells were harvested. Total RNA was purified and the level of the CDKN2A mRNA was assessed by RT\u2013PCR. Figure 2d shows that the AUF1 level decreased significantly in the AUF1-siRNA-expressing cells as compared with the control cells. Concomitantly, the CDKN2A mRNA level increased in the AUF1-siRNA-expressing cells (Figure 2d), indicating that AUF1 is indeed a negative regulator of CDKN2A in breast stromal fibroblasts, and it's increase reduced p16 expression in these cells.p16 Downregulation upregulates the \u03b1-SMA, SDF-1 and MMP-2 proteinsIn an effort to study the various effects of p16 downregulation, TCF-64 cells were transfected with a vector expressing either CDKN2A siRNA or a nonspecific control siRNA as previously described. Subsequently, specific antibodies were used for immunoblotting analysis. Figure 3a shows that p16 protein level declined 7.7-fold in the CDKN2A-siRNA-treated cells (T64-si) as compared with their corresponding control cells (T64C). However, the level of p14 was not affected, while the expression of p21 decreased, as expected, like in CAF-64 cells (Figure 3a).Interestingly, like in the corresponding CAF-64 cells, this decrease in the p16 protein level was accompanied by strong increase in the levels of \u03b1-SMA (10-fold) and SDF-1 (threefold; Figure 3a), two important markers of activated stromal fibroblasts. Likewise, p16 downregulation increased the expression of MMP-2 (twofold). This suggests a possible role of p16 in repressing breast stromal fibroblasts.The effect of the p16 knockdown was also assessed on the MMP-2 and SDF-1 mRNA levels by real-time RT\u2013PCR. Figure 3b shows that the mRNA levels of the two genes increased by about 50% in p16-defective cells as compared with their corresponding controls, with P-values of 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 5 \u00d7 10\u22124, respectively. Similar results were obtained when p16 was downregulated with a specific shRNA targeting different sequence of the gene and used transiently (data not shown). To further show this, CAF-64 cells were transfected with adenovirus-based plasmids-expressing CDKN2A (C64-ORF (open reading frame)) or not (C64C). Total RNA was purified from these cells 3 days post infection and real-time RT\u2013PCR using specific primers was performed. Figure 3c upper panel shows the increase in the expression of CDKN2A in cells expressing the gene. The lower panel shows that the introduction of the CDKN2A ORF in CAF-64 cells significantly reduced the expression of the MMP-2 and SDF-1 mRNAs. Therefore, the mRNA levels of these genes are modulated in a p16-dependent manner.p16 Suppresses the secretion of SDF-1 and MMP-2 from breast stromal fibroblastsCAF-64 and TCF-64 as well as T64-si and T64C cells were cultured in complete media for 24\u2009h, and CM from each culture were collected and the levels of SDF-1 and MMP-2 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assay. Figure 3c shows that the levels of secreted proteins from CAF-64 were higher than their levels secreted from TCF-64. Likewise, the downregulation of p16 also increased the secretion of these proteins (Figure 3c). Indeed, the levels of SDF-1 and MMP-2 were 2.5-fold higher in T64-si cells than in the control cells (Figure 3c). These values mirror those of protein expression obtained by immunobloting and depicted on Figure 3a. Similar results were obtained using CDKN2A-shRNA (data not shown). Furthermore, CM from CAF-64 cells expressing the CDKN2A gene (C64-ORF) and their respective control cells (C64C) were collected, and the levels of SDF-1 and MMP-2 were assessed by ELISA. Figure 3e shows that the increase in the level of the p16 coding gene reduced the secreted levels of SDF-1 and MMP-2. This indicates that p16 restrains the secretion of these cancer-promoting proteins in breast stromal fibroblasts.p16-Deficient fibroblast secretions stimulate breast cancer cell invasion/migration in an SDF1-dependent mannerNext, we sought to study the effect of p16 downregulation in fibroblast cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. To this end, we used serum-free-CM (SF-CM) collected from T64-si and T64C after 24\u2009h of culture. In addition, CpM and SFM were used as controls. Subsequently, 105 MDA-MB-231 cells in 200\u2009\u03bcl SF-CM were seeded in the upper compartment of the migration and invasion plates for 24\u2009h. The migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells were higher in the presence of CpM than in the presence of SFM (Figure 4a). Interestingly, the migration and invasion of cancer cells were more significant when these cells were incubated with media from p16-defective cells. Indeed, the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells were, respectively, two and threefold higher in the presence of SF-CM from T64si cells than from the control cells (P-values=0.0039 and 1.92 \u00d7 10\u22125, respectively; Figure 4a). Likewise, the invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells were twofold higher in the presence of SF-CM from TCF-64 cells expressing CDKN2A-shRNA than in the presence of SF-CM from the control cells (data not shown). Similarly, SF-CM from p16\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stimulated the migration/invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells more than SF-CM from p16+/+ MEFs (Figure 4b). Interestingly, increasing the expression of the CDKN2A gene through ectopic expression in the CAF-64 cells (C64-ORF) significantly reduced the ability of these cells (as compared with their control counterparts) in enhancing the invasion/migration of breast cancer cells (Figure 4c).In an attempt to investigate the possible role of SDF-1 in this stimulation in both human and mouse cells, SF-CM from T64-si and p16\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were either challenged either with immunoglobulin G1 antibody or with anti-SDF-1 inhibitory antibody, and the effect on the migration/invasion of the MDA-MB-231 cells was studied as described above. Figure 4d confirms the stimulatory effect of CDKN2A downregulation and also shows that the inhibition of SDF-1 in SF-CM from both human and mouse fibroblasts reduced the migration/invasion potential of breast cancer cells to levels similar to those obtained with SF-CM from the respective cells.p16-Deficient fibroblast secretions stimulate an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition-like state in breast cancer cellsNext, the level of the active forms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt was assessed by immunoblotting in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SF-CM from TCF-64, CAF-64 as well as T64-si and T64C. Figure 5a shows that while the levels of the inactive forms of these proteins did not change, the levels of the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt increased in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SF-CM from CAF-64 and T64-si, as compared with their respective controls. These factors are known to induce the motile and invasive capacities of cancer cells via promotion of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition state. To further confirm this transition, we assessed the levels of N-cadherin, CD90 and vimentin as important markers of mesenchymal cells. Figure 5a shows that the level of the N-cadherin protein increased in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with SF-CM from T64-si cells as compared with the control. Using flow cytometry, we have also shown that CD90 and vimentin levels were markedly higher in breast cancer cells exposed to media conditioned with p16-defective cells as compared with their respective controls (Figure 5b). Together, these results indicate that p16-defective breast stromal fibroblasts trigger epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition state in a paracrine manner.p16 Downregulation in stromal fibroblasts stimulates epithelial cell proliferation through paracrine signalingCAF-64, TCF-64, T64-si and T64C were cultured in SFM for 24\u2009h, counted and SF-CM was collected and then added separately to MCF-10 cells in 96-well plates. The real-time cell electronic sensing system (ACEA Biosciences Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to monitor the effect of each SF-CM as well as SFM and complete media (used as controls) on cellular proliferation. Although MCF-10 cells proliferated rapidly in the presence of CpM, their multiplication was very slow in the presence of SFM (Figure 5c). Furthermore, MCF-10A proliferated faster under the effect of CAF-64 SF-CM than in the presence of SF-CM from the corresponding cells (TCF-64). Interestingly, SF-CM from p16-defective T64-si cells enhanced more than twofold the proliferation rate of MCF-10 cells as compared with their proliferation in the presence of SF-CM from control cells (Figure 5c). This indicates that p16 in breast stromal fibroblasts inhibits epithelial cell proliferation through paracrine secreted factors.AUF1 downregulation suppresses the effects of p16-deficient stromal fibroblastsAfter showing that AUF1 downregulation upregulates p16 in CAF-64 cells (Figure 2d), we sought to investigate the effect of this downregulation on the level of secreted SDF-1 and MMP-2. To this end, the levels of these proteins were assessed by ELISA in CM from CAF-64-expressing AUF1-siRNA or control-siRNA. Figure 6a shows that AUF1-defective cells wherein p16 level increased showed a strong decrease in the secreted levels of SDF-1 and MMP-2.Next, we sought to study the effect of AUF1 downregulation in CAF-64 cells on the migration/invasion of breast cancer cells using SF-CM collected from CAF-64-expressing AUF1-siRNA or control-siRNA. The invasion and the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed as described above, and were found to be lower in the presence of SF-CM from C64-si cells than from C64C cells (P-values=0.002246 and 0.000608, respectively; Figure 6b). This indicates that AUF1 downregulation reduces the pro-carcinogenic effects of p16-defective stromal fibroblasts, may be through p16-upregulation.p16-Deficient fibroblasts stimulate breast cancer xenograft growth in miceTo investigate the effect of p16 deficiency in fibroblasts on tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo, 25 nude mice were randomized into five groups and breast cancer xenografts were created subcutaneously by coimplantation of MDA-MB-231 cells (2 \u00d7 106) with p16\u2212/\u2212 or p16+/+ MEFs (106) into the right leg of each mouse. As controls 5 \u00d7 106 and 2 \u00d7 106 MDA-MB-231 cells and 106 p16\u2212/\u2212 cells were injected separately. MEF cells were used in these experiments because of their fast growth as compared with the transfected breast stromal fibroblasts (T64si and the corresponding T64C). Although all mice coinjected with MDA-MB-231 and p16\u2212/\u2212 MEF cells developed tumors, only two out of five mice coninjected with MDA-MB-231 and p16+/+ MEFs had tumors. Interestingly, tumors containing p16-deficient fibroblasts (T-MEFp16\u2212/\u2212) appeared only 1 week post injection and grew faster than those containing p16-proficient fibroblasts (T-MEFp16+/+), which appeared after 3 weeks (Figure 7a). No tumors were obtained by injecting p16\u2212/\u2212 or MDA-MB-231 (2 \u00d7 105) cells alone, while four out of five mice developed tumors following the injection of MDA-MB-231 (5 \u00d7 105) cells alone and appeared only after 4 weeks. However, the histology of the formed tumors was similar in both cases (data not shown). These results show that p16-defective fibroblasts promoted breast cancer tumor formation and enhanced their growth rate in nude mice as compared with their isogenic normal cells.To further elucidate the role of p16 in the effect of these fibroblasts on cancer cells in vivo, whole-cell extracts were prepared from the two tumor xenografts T-MEFp16+/+ and 2 T-MEFp16\u2212/\u2212, and the levels of various cancer- and metastasis-promoting genes were assessed by immunoblotting. Figure 7b shows that while the level of Akt is similar in all the four tumors, the level of the phosphorylated form of the protein was higher in the two T-MEFp16\u2212/\u2212 than in the T-MEFp16+/+ tumors. Then, we assessed the levels of important downstream targets of the Atk/NF-kB pathway, namely Cox-2 and cyclin D1. In fact the levels of these two important oncogenes were markedly higher in the two T-MEFp16\u2212/\u2212 than in the T-MEFp16+/+ tumors (Figure 7b). We also assessed the level of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and have found that these two proteins are also highly expressed in the two tumors with MEFp16\u2212/\u2212 than in the two T-MEFp16+/+ (Figure 7b). As MDA-MB-231 cells do not express p16, this protein was not detected in both types of tumors T-MEFp16\u2212/\u2212 and T-MEFp16+/+ (data not shown). Furthermore, we assessed the level of p16, cyclin D1 and MMP-9 in MEFp16\u2212/\u2212 and MEFp16+/+ and have shown that p16 knockdown did not affect the level of MMP-9 and rather decreased the level of cyclin D1 in pure MEF cells (data not shown), confirming that the observed effects were rather on breast cancer epithelial cells.DiscussionIn this study, we have shown that the tumor suppressor p16 protein has an important role in controlling mammary stromal fibroblast autocrine and paracrine signaling. We started this study by showing that p16 is downregulated in CAFs as compared with their corresponding TCFs, isolated from the same patients. This p16 decrease suggests a role of cancer cells in suppressing p16 expression in fibroblast cells present in their vicinity, either directly or indirectly through sustained proliferative stress. In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that neoplastic cells have the ability to affect their microenvironment and modulate gene expression in the surrounding fibroblasts through secreted factors. In addition, p16 expression was also low in some TCF cells as compared with TCFs from other patients, which could be owing to interindividual variation in the expression of p16.The reduction in p16 level did not result from methylation of the p16 promoter (data not shown), but was due to a decrease in the stability of the CDKN2A mRNA in CAFs, which resulted from the increase in the expression of the CDKN2A mRNA destabilizing protein AUF1. AUF1 knockdown in CAF cells increased the expression of the CDKN2A mRNA and also suppressed the pro-carcinogenic effects of these cells. Intriguingly, AUF1 level was found higher in TCF-114 than in its counterpart CAF-114, with no much effect on p16 level. This could suggest alteration in other p16/AUF1-regulatory pathway(s) in these cells. Interestingly, AUF1 controls also the expression of many other important breast cancer-related proteins such as Cox-2, cyclin D1, C-Myc, Bcl-2, ER\u03b1 and many others. This indicates that the increase in the level of AUF1 in breast stromal fibroblasts could constitute a major change in CAFs that could explain, in great part, the significant modulation in gene expression that has been previously reported in such cells.In addition, we have shown that p16 negatively regulates the expression of both SDF-1 and MMP-2 in breast stromal fibroblasts. SDF-1, a promoter of tumor growth and angiogenesis, is also negatively controlled by p53. This indicates that this important cancer-promoting factor is under the control of two master tumor suppressor proteins p16 and p53. Indeed, inhibition of SDF-1 in CM severely reduced the pro-invasive/migratory effects of p16-defective human and MEF cells (Figure 4). Regarding MMP-2, several lines of evidence suggests that p16 negatively regulates this pro-invasion protein in various cell types. Indeed, p16 expression inhibited the expression of MMP-2 in lung cancer cells and in glioma. The present findings corroborate these results and provide clear evidence that MMP-2 expression is modulated in a p16-dependent manner in breast stromal fibroblasts. These results raise an important question on how p16 regulates the expression/secretion of these factors. In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that p16 is not a mere CDKI. p16 Overexpression has also been found in some benign tumors and in some cancer types, such as cervical cancer, breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Therefore, it is possible that p16 is affecting the expression of these genes through modulating the kinase activity of CDK4 and/or CDK6. The other possibility is that this p16 function is mediated through interaction with other proteins. Indeed, it has been shown that p16 interacts with several proteins involved directly or indirectly in the control of gene expression such as HSP90, EF-2, hnRNP C1 and others. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that p16 interacts with GRAM-19 to regulate E2F1-responsive gene expression.The enhancement of the migratory ability of breast cancer cells was higher in the presence of media conditioned with p16-defective human cells than with p16\u2212/\u2212 MEFs as compared with their respective controls (Figure 4). It is possible that the pro-migratory effect of p16 deficiency is higher in human fibroblasts than in MEFs, owing to higher amounts of secreted cytokines and growth factors. It is also possible that the secreted human factors are more efficient than their counterpart mouse factors in enhancing the migration of human breast cancer cells.Importantly, we have shown that CM from p16-defective stromal fibroblast cells induced the three major mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin and CD90 and also activated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, two migration- and invasion-promoting factors, in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5a). It has been previously shown that this epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition can be induced by active fibroblasts and enhances the migratory and invasiveness capacity of breast cancer cells. This shows that p16 has a major role in stromal fibroblast-mediated epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition state and its consequent increase in the invasive and metastatic behavior of neoplastic cells.In addition, p16-deficient fibroblasts enhanced the proliferation of epithelial cells in vitro and the formation and growth of breast tumor xenografts in mice, which is another major feature of activated fibroblasts. The tumors formed in the presence of p16-deficient cells expressed high levels of Cox-2 and MMP-9, known to promote tumor cell invasion and has been recently shown to be an important mediator of CAF-induced tumor growth and progression. These tumors showed also high levels of MMP-2, cyclin D1 and active Akt, which explains their faster onset and growth.In addition to p16, other important tumor suppressor genes such as p53, p21, PTEN and CAV-1 are also implicated in repressing the procarcinogenic effects of breast stromal fibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo., In summary, the present findings have shown that in addition to its well-known cell-autonomous tumor suppressor function within incipient pro-carcinogenic epithelial cells, stromal fibroblast p16, like other tumor suppressor genes, exerts also cell nonautonomous effects on breast tumorigenesis. Therefore, stromal fibroblast p16 might constitute a valid therapeutic target to stop tumor progression and/or recurrence.Materials and methodsCells, cell culture and chemicalsBreast fibroblast cells were obtained, characterized and cultured as previously described. MEF cell lines (a generous gift from Dr R A DePinho) were cultured as described previously and used at low passages (6\u20138). In the present experiments, CAFs and their corresponding TCFs were always cultured simultaneously, in the same conditions and at similar passages (4\u20138). CAFs grow slightly faster than their corresponding TCFs and slight variation in cellular growth was also observed between various CAFs and various TCFs, and both can reach passage 12 with no sign of senescence.MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured following the instructions of the company.

        "title": "Gbetagamma signaling promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion.",
        "content": "Signaling through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) promotes breast cancer metastasis. G proteins convey GPCR signals by dissociating into Galpha and Gbetagamma subunits. The aim of the present study was to determine whether blockade of Gbetagamma signaling suppresses breast cancer cell migration and invasion, which are critical components of metastasis. Conditioned media (CM) of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts are widely used as chemoattractants in in vitro cancer metastasis studies. Expression of a Gbetagamma scavenger peptide attenuated NIH-3T3 CM-induced migration and invasion of both metastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells by 40 to 50% without effects on cell viability. Migration and invasion of cells in response to NIH-3T3 CM were also blocked by 8-(4,5,6-trihydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthen-9-yl)-1-naph-thalene-carboxylic acid) (M119K), a Gbetagamma inhibitor, with maximum inhibition exceeding 80% and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1 to 2 microM. M119K also attenuated Rac-dependent formation of lamellipodia, a key structure required for metastasis. Constitutively active Rac1 rescued Gbetagamma blockade-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell migration, whereas dominant negative Rac1 inhibited cell migration similar to Gbetagamma blockade. Furthermore, M119K suppressed Gi protein-coupled CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-dependent MDA-MB-231 cell migration by 80% with an IC50 value of 1 microM, whereas tyrosine kinase receptor-dependent cell migration was significantly less inhibited. However, CXCR4-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a Gialpha-mediated response in MDA-MB-231 cells, was not blocked by M119K but was blocked by pertussis toxin, which selectively inactivates Gialpha. This report is the first to directly demonstrate the role of Gbetagamma in cancer cell migration and invasion and suggests that targeting Gbetagamma signaling pathways may provide a novel strategy for suppressing breast cancer metastasis.",

        "content": "Although cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) mainly produce CXCL12 and stimulate CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in cancer cells, the significance of this interaction in adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG) was unclear. This study investigated the functional characteristics of CAF-derived CXCL12 in AEG. Immunohistochemical staining for CXCL12 was performed on sections from 123 AEG patients and analyzed against clinicopathological data. Newly isolated CAFs and normal fibroblasts were examined for phenotype. An invasion assay was performed with AEG cells co-cultured with CAFs isolated from AEG. CXCL12 expression was significantly associated with age, depth of invasion, lymphatic invasion, and lymph node metastases. High CXCL12 expression significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Isolated CAFs had abundant \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression and showed various CXCL12 expression patterns. Notably, AEG cells co-cultured with CXCL(high)-expressing CAFs invaded more than when co-cultured with CXCL(low)-expressing CAFs; these invasive properties were impeded by CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. We demonstrated that AEG cells co-cultured with CXCL12(high) CAFs were significantly more invasive than those co-cultured with CXCL12(low) CAFs and that high CXCL12 expression correlates with poor prognosis in AEG patients. CXCL12 derived from CAFs in tumor microenvironment stimulates CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in AEG cells and promotes their invasive ability, resulting in tumor progression. ",

        "content": "Fibroblasts often constitute the majority of the stromal cells within a breast carcinoma, yet the functional contributions of these cells to tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Using a coimplantation tumor xenograft model, we demonstrate that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) extracted from human breast carcinomas promote the growth of admixed breast carcinoma cells significantly more than do normal mammary fibroblasts derived from the same patients. The CAFs, which exhibit the traits of myofibroblasts, play a central role in promoting the growth of tumor cells through their ability to secrete stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1); CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into carcinomas, an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. CAF-secreted SDF-1 also stimulates tumor growth directly, acting through the cognate receptor, CXCR4, which is expressed by carcinoma cells. Our findings indicate that fibroblasts within invasive breast carcinomas contribute to tumor promotion in large part through the secretion of SDF-1.",

        "content": "Cancer cells are known to reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to act as tumor supporters. The presence and role of CAFs in mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, are unknown. This study sought to characterize CAFs in MF and their cross talk with the lymphoma cells using primary fibroblast cultures from punch biopsies of patients with early-stage MF and healthy subjects. MF cultures yielded significantly increased levels of FAP\u03b1, a CAF marker, and CAF-associated genes and proteins: CXCL12 (ligand of CXCR4 expressed on MF cells), collagen XI, and matrix metalloproteinase 2. Cultured MF fibroblasts showed greater proliferation than normal fibroblasts in ex\u00a0vivo experiments. A coculture with MyLa cells (MF cell line) increased normal fibroblast growth, reduced the sensitivity of MyLa cells to doxorubicin, and enhanced their migration. Inhibiting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis increased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis of MyLa cells and reduced MyLa cell motility. Our data suggest that the fibroblasts in MF lesions are more proliferative than fibroblasts in normal skin and that CAFs protect MF cells from doxorubicin-induced cell death and increase their migration through the secretion of CXCL12. Reversing the CAF-mediated tumor microenvironment in MF may improve the efficiency of anticancer therapy.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are key contributors to malignant progression, but their critical regulators remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined the role of Twist1, a central regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in carcinoma cells, in the transdifferentiation of normal quiescent fibroblasts to CAF and we defined its upstream controls and downstream effectors. Primary human gastric fibroblast and CAF cultures were established from gastrectomy specimens and validated as nontumor cells by somatic mutation analyses. In these cultures, exposure to the proinflammatory cytokine IL6 commonly expressed in tumors was sufficient to induce Twist1 expression in normal fibroblasts and transdifferentiate them into CAFs via STAT3 phosphorylation. In xenograft models, tumor infiltration of Twist1-expressing CAFs was enhanced strongly by ectopic IL6 expression in gastric or breast cancer cells. We found that Twist1 expression was necessary and sufficient for CAF transdifferentiation. Enforced expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts was also sufficient to drive CAF marker expression and malignant character in gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, silencing the expression of Twist1 in CAFs abrogated their tumor-promoting properties. Downstream of Twist1, we defined the chemokine CXCL12 as a transcriptional target. Clinically, CXCL12 and Twist1 expression were correlated in CAFs present in gastric tumor specimens. Finally, ectopic expression of Twist1 in normal fibroblasts suppressed premature senescence, whereas Twist1 attenuation accelerated senescence in CAFs. Our findings define Twist1 as a compelling target to deprogram the tumor-supporting features of the cancer microenvironment.",

SDF-1 may therefore have potential value in assessing clinical outcomes of patients with breast cancer.IntroductionBreast cancer is the most common female cancer in the UK and USA. One in ten women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime in Western countries. The poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer is related to tumour recurrence and metastasis. Breast cancer is characterized by metastasis to regional lymph nodes, bone marrow, lungs and the liver. Previous studies demonstrated that sites of metastasis are determined not only by the characteristics of neoplastic cells but also by the microenvironment of the specific organs. Organ specific attractant molecules can promote homing of tumour cells to particular sites.Stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 (CXC chemokine ligand-12) is a member of CXC chemokine family, which was initially cloned from murine bone marrow and characterized as a pre-B-cell growth stimulating factor. SDF-1 exerts effects through its cognate receptor CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR4), which is the only physiological receptor for SDF-1 and is known to play roles in chemotaxis, haematopoiesis, vasculogenesis and tumour spread and metastasis. It was recently shown that CXCR4 is involved in homing of tumour cells to specific organs and in tumour progression. Muller and coworkers found that SDF-1/CXCR4 plays a critical role in determining the metastatic destination of breast cancer cells. Moreover, they demonstrated that neutralization with a specific monoclonal antibody against CXCR4 effectively inhibited the metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lung or lymph nodes in mice.However, despite the accumulated information on CXCR4, few studies have been conducted to evaluate SDF-1 expression and its prognostic value in patients with breast cancer. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the SDF-1 gene in breast cancer cells on their invasive and migration properties, using a SDF-1 transfection technique. Furthermore, we analyzed SDF-1 expression by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, and its relation with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes in human breast cancer.Materials and methodMaterialsThe RNA extraction kit and reverse transcription kit were obtained from AbGene Ltd (Epsom, Surrey, UK). PCR primers were designed using Beacon Designer (Palo Alto, CA, USA) and synthesized by Invitrogen Ltd (Paisley, UK). Molecular biology grade agarose and DNA ladder were obtained from Invitrogen. The master mix for routine PCR and quantitative PCR was from AbGene Ltd. Goat anti-human SDF-1 polyclonal antibodies and rabbit anti-human CXCR4 polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Ltd (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Peroxidase conjugated anti-goat and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, England, UK) and a biotin universal staining kit was from Vector Laboratories (Nottingham, England, UK). Matrigel (reconstituted basement membrane) was purchased from Collaborative Research Products (Bedford, MA, USA). A transwell plate equipped with a porous insert (pore size 8 \u03bcm] was obtained from Becton Dickinson Labware (Oxford, UK).Cell lines and culture conditionsThe following human breast cancer cell lines were used: MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453, MCF7, BT549 and ZR751 (purchased from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK). Human foetal lung fibroblast cell line MRC5 (from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures) and human vascular endothelial cell line HECV (from the Biology and Cellular and Molecular Pathology Department, Naples, Italy) were also used. The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% foetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and at 37\u00b0C in a humid atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide/95% air.Construction of SDF-1 expression cassetteFull-length human SDF-1 cDNA was obtained by amplifying the mRNA from normal human fibroblasts, using RT-PCR with the following primers: sdf1exf1 (5'-atgaacgccaaggtcgtg-3'] and SDF1ExR1 (5'-tcacatcttgaacctcttgtt-3'). The discrete SDF-1 product was subsequently TA cloned into pcDNA4/GFP-NT vector (Invitrogen Ltd), followed by transformation using One-Shot E. coli (Invitrogen Ltd), verification, and amplification. Purified plasmid, or control plasmid, was used to transfect MDA-MB-231 cells by electroporation using an electroporator, EasyJet Plus (Flowgen, Boughton, Kent, England, UK), followed by selection with G418 (Sigma). Stable SDF-1 transfectant (MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+), or stable control plasmid transfectant (MDA-MB-231+/-), was subsequently established and verified.In vitro invasion analysisThis technique was previously reported and modified in our laboratory. Briefly, transwell inserts with 8 \u03bcm pore size were coated with 50 \u03bcg Matrigel and dried, before being rehydrated. Breast cancer cells (20 \u00d7 103) were added to each well. After 96 hours cells that had migrated through the matrix and stuck to the other side of the insert were fixed (4% formalin), stained with 0.5% (weight/volume) crystal violet and counted under a microscope.Migration assayThe migration assay was based on a method established in our laboratories. Confluent cells were first overlaid with light mineral oil and then placed on a stage heated to 37\u00b0C. The cell monolayer was scratched using a fine plastic pipette, creating wounds of approximate 250 \u03bcm in width. These wounds were then continuously monitored using a digital camera and time-lapse video recorder. Images were subsequently obtained at 10-min intervals and analyzed using a motion analysis package (Optimas 6) (Optimas Corporation, Bothell, Washington, USA). The accumulated distance that cells travelled over a period of 10 min was analyzed. More than 20 cells were analyzed in each setting, and data were automatically processed using Excel software.Tissue samplesTissue samples were collected from patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy. Breast cancer tissue samples (n = 120) and normal mammary tissue samples (from the same patients but away from tumours, and free from tumour cells, as confirmed by subsequent histological analysis; n = 32) were collected immediately after surgery and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Patients were routinely followed clinically after surgery and details were stored in a database. The median follow-up period was 72 months. Details of histology were obtained from pathology reports (Table 1).RT-PCR and real-time Quantitative PCRFrozen sections of tissues were cut at a thickness of 5\u201310 \u03bcm and kept for immunohistochemistry and routine histology. An additional 15\u201320 sections were mixed and homogenized using a hand-held homogenizer, in ice-cold RNA extraction solution. Total RNA extraction from frozen tissues and culture cells was performed using standard RNA isolation kit. The concentration of RNA was determined using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Reverse transcription was conducted using a reverse transcription kit with an anchored oligo [dT] primer supplied by AbGene Ltd, using 1 \u03bcg total RNA in a 96-well plate. The quality of cDNA was verified using \u03b2-actin primers (5'-caggaggttgaaggactaaa-3' and 5'-gggatcagttttctttgtca-3').Conventional PCR was performed with specific primers for SDF-1 and CXCR4. Amplication conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. This was followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72\u00b0C. The products were visualized on 2% agarose gel after stain with ethidium brominde.The level of SDF-1 and CXCR4 transcripts from the prepared cDNA was determined using a real-time quantitative PCR, based on Amplifluor technology, modified from a method reported previously. (TCS Biologicals Oxford, England, UK) Briefly, pairs of PCR primers were similarly designed using Beacon Designer software, version 2 (Biosoft International, Palo Alto, California, USA) (primer sequence: sense SDF-1 5'-ttcaggagtacctggagaaa-3', CXCR4 5'-cttcttaactggcattgtgg-3'; antisense SDF-1 5'-actgaacctgaccgtacacctaacactggt-3', CXCR4 5'-actgaacctgaccgtacagtgatgacaaag-3'), but an additional sequence was added to one of the primers. This is known as the Z sequence (5'-actgaacctgaccgtaca-3') which is complementary to the universal Z probe (Intergen Inc, Oxford, UK). The primers used for quantitation of oestrogen receptor (ER) and ER-\u03b2 were as we reported previously (ER; 5'-cctactacctggagaacgag-3' and 5'-ctcttcggtcttttcgtatg-3'; and ER-\u03b2: 5'-aaaagaatcattcaatgaca-3' and 5'-attaacacctccatccaaca-3'). Primers used to quantify CK19 were as previously reported (5'-caggtccgaggttactgac-3' and 5'-actgaacctgaccgtacacactttctgc cagtgtgtcttc-3', respectively).The reaction was carried out using the following: Hot-start Q-master mix (AbGene Ltd); 10 pmol of specific forward primer; 1 pmol reverse primer, which has the Z sequence; 10 pmol of FAMtagged probe (Intergen Inc), and cDNA from ~50 ng of RNA. The reaction was conducted using IcyclerIQ (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Herts, England, UK), which is equipped with an optic unit that allows real-time detection of 96 reactions, under the following conditions: 94\u00b0C for 12 min and 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 40 s, and 72\u00b0C for 20 s. The levels of transcripts were generated from a standard that was simultaneously amplified with the samples.Immunohistochemical staining of SDF-1 proteinsIn the present study, normal breast tissue samples (n = 32) and their respective matched breast tumour samples (n = 32) were used for immunohistochmemical analysis. Tissues were frozen and sectioned at a thickness of 6 \u03bcm using a cryostat. The sections were mounted on SuperFrostPlus microscope slides (Ramond A Lamb, London, England, UK) and were air-dried and then fixed in a mixture of 50% acetone and 50% methanol. The sections were then placed in Optimax wash buffer (San Ramon, California, USA) for 5\u201310 min to rehydrate. Sections were incubated for 20 min in a 0.6% bovine serum albumin blocking solution and were then probed with the primary antibody for 1 hour. After extensive washings in buffer, sections were incubated for 30 min in the secondary biotinylated antibody (Multilink Swine anti-goat and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin; Dako Inc., Angel Drove, Ely, Cambridgeshire, England, UK). After washing, avidin biotin complex (Vector Laboratories) was then applied to the sections followed once more by extensive washings. Diaminobenzidine chromogen (Vector Laboratories) was then added to the sections, which were then incubated in the dark for 5 min. Sections were then counterstained in Gill's haematoxylin and were dehydrated in ascending grades of methanol before clearing in xylene and mounting under a coverslip.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was carried out using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, survival analysis was using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis and Cox hazardous proportion analysis, using the SPSS version 11 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsExpression of SDF-1/CXCR4 mRNA in cell lines and in human breast cancer tissuresSDF-1 mRNA was identified in MRC5, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-436 and breast cancer tissues, but not in other breast cancer cell lines and HECV cells. It has been suggested that the MDA-MB-435 cell line is of melanocyte origin, and MDA-MB-436 was the only SDF-1 positive breast cancer cell line of all the lines tested in the present study. In contrast, CXCR4 mRNA expression was detected in all eight breast cancer cell lines, in MRC5 and HECV cells (Fig. 1), and in breast cancer tissue (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of the SDF-1 transcript revealed that breast tumour tissues had high levels of SDF-1 transcript (mean \u00b1 standard deviation: 195 \u00b1 103 copies) as compared with normal mammary tissues (85.6 \u00b1 54), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.35). To take into account the contribution made by cellularity in mammary tissues, levels of SDF1 were normalized to the level of CK19. Dispite a higher SDF1:CK19 ratio in tumour tissues (39.3 \u00b1 13.6) than in normal breast tissue (30.7 \u00b1 3.97), the difference was not significant (P = 0.84). With respect to ER, those tumours negative for ER had higher levels of SDF-1 (246 \u00b1 138) than did ER-positive tumours (57.9 \u00b1 45.4; P = 0.20). A similar, insignificant trend was seen with ER-\u03b2 (248.0 \u00b1 131 for ER-\u03b2- tumours and 1.3 \u00b1 0.72 for ER-\u03b2+ tumours). The SDF-1:CK19 ratio for ER-negative tumours was 52.7 \u00b1 41.6 and that for ER-positive tumours was 30.8 \u00b1 14.4 (P = 0.62). The ratio was 41.2 \u00b1 17.3 for ER-\u03b2-negative and 8.3 \u00b1 5.1 for ER-\u03b2-positive tumours (P = 0.072).SDF-1 has the potential to promote invasion and migrationMDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells, which stably expressed SDF-1 (Fig. 2a), and MDA-MB-231+/- (stable control plasmid transfectant) and wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells, which were SDF-1 negative, were tested for their invasiveness and migration. MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells exhibited greater invasiveness through Matrigel than did wild-type and MDA-MB-231+/- cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 2b). In addition, the migration speed of MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells was markedly increased compared with the respective controls (Fig. 2c).SDF-1/CXCR4 immunohistochemical staining in human breast cancerImmunohistochemical staining confirmed expression of SDF-1 at the protein level in breast cancer tissue samples. In contrast to the adjacent nonmalignant tissue, we were able to demonstrate heterogeneous but consistent expression of SDF-1 antigen in tumour tissue. Immunohistochemical staining of SDF-1 appeared in most tumour cells and in stromal cells (Fig. 3a,b). As expected, staining of CXCR4 were seen in both normal and tumour cells (Fig. 3c,d), with staining in tumour cells being markedly stronger.SDF-1 expression and lymphatic nodal status, histological types, grades and stagingWe analyzed the levels of SDF-1 in relation to nodal status (Fig. 4a). Node-positive tumours had significantly higher levels of SDF-1 than did node-negative ones. The expression level of SDF-1 tended to be higher in the node-positive group, although there was no statistically significant difference between node-positive and node-negative groups (P = 0.05). The data were further analyzed by dividing node-positive and node-negative tumours into ER-positive and ER-negative groups. For SDF-1 no significant differences between subgroups were observed (ER-/node- versus ER-/node+, P = 0.25; ER-/node- versus ER+/node-, P = 0.57; P values for SDF1:CK19 were 0.27 and 0.32, respectively). No significant difference in SDF-1 was seen between ER-positive/node-negative and ER-positive/node-positive subgroups (P = 0.24; for SDF1:CK19 P = 0.27). Similarly, when node-positive and node-negative tumours were subdivided into ER-\u03b2-positive and ER-\u03b2-negative subgroups, no significant difference was seen.We examined expression of SDF-1 relative to tumor types, grade and staging (Table 2). There was a trend in the differences in SDF1 expression between tumour grades, in that grade 3 and grade 2 tumours tended to have higher SDF1 levels than did grade 1 tumours, but this was not statistically significant. There were no significant relations between expression level of SDF-1 and tumor type and stage.SDF-1 expression correlated with prognosis and long term survivalThe expression level of SDF-1 correlated with clinical outcome; patients with local recurrence (P = 0.05) and those who died from breast cancer (P = 0.03) had signfiantly higher levels of SDF-1 transcript (Fig. 4b). Those patients with metastasis and local recurrence, and who died from breast cancer had significantly higher levels of SDF-1 than did the disease-free group (P = 0.01; Fig. 4c).To determine whether SDF-1 transcript levels were associated with long-term survival, we divided patients into those with high levels (n = 79) and those with low levels (n = 41) of SDF-1. The cutoff point was determined using the Nottingham Prognostic Index, and was set at the level at which patients had moderate prognoses (Nottingham Prognostic Index 3.4\u20135.4). As shown in the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve (Fig. 5), high levels of SDF-1 significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (mean survival 94.1 months [95% confidence interval 65.4\u2013122.9 months] versus 143.6 months [95% confidence interval 135.2\u2013152.0 months] months for those with low levels of SDF-1; P = 0.001; Fig. 5a). Further analysis taking tumour grade into account was not possible because the sample number in each subgroup was too small. Similarly, high SDF-1 levels were associated with reduced incidence-free survival (P = 0.035 by Cox proportion analysis; Fig. 5b).DiscussionChemokines are a family of small molecular weight proteins (8\u201310 kDa) that are classified into four distinct groups, depending on the positioning of the cysteine motif at the NH2 terminus. The family members include CXC, CC, C and CXXXC chemokines. The specific effects of chemokines on their target cells are mediated by members of a family of seven-transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors.SDF-1 is a member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines and its receptor is CXCR4. SDF-1 is constitutively expressed in various organs including bone, lung, liver, brain, thymus and lymph nodes, but SDF-1 is mainly produced by stromal cells, such as osteoblasts, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the bone marrow. Despite numerous studies on CXCR4 in breast cancer, reports on SDF-1 in human breast cancer are limited.In the present study the expression of CXCR4 was detected in various cell lines and in malignant and nonmalignant breast tissues, but SDF-1 expression was only observed in two out of the eight breast cancer cell lines and in the fibroblast cell line MRC5. These results indicate that certain breast cancer cells co-express SDF-1 and CXCR4, which may act as a potential autocrine mechanism in breast cancer. We have reported that the fibroblast cell line, MRC5, strongly expressed SDF-1. Furthermore, in the present study immunohistochemical staining of SDF-1 was apparent in most tumour cells and in stromal cells. Collectively, from the results, we suggest that SDF-1 in breast cancer is produced by both tumour cells and stromal cells. The other potential source is the infiltrated immune cells, which frequently express CXCR4 and SDF1. The present study did not examine the proportion of these cells that produced SDF1 or the degree of expression, which would be an interesting focus for future studies.The present study provides strong evidence that, when the SDF-1/CXCR4 complex existed (i.e. in MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells, which expressed both SDF-1 and CXCR4), breast cancer cells exhibited significant increases in invasiveness and faster migration. These findings suggest that breast cancer cells that co-express SDF-1 and CXCR4 may be more aggressive. In the present study we were unable to transfect fibroblasts with the current bacterial vector because no fibroblasts subsequently survived the electroporation and genetic marker selection process. It will be useful to develop viral expression for the purpose for future work. In addition, high levels of SDF-1 expression tended to be present in grade 3 and grade 2 tumors as compared with grade 1 tumours, further supporting the contention that breast cancer cells that express high levels of SDF-1 are more invasive.Recently, studies implicated CXCR4 in chemotaxis, invasiveness and metastasis of tumours, particularly in metastasis of breast cancer, in an organ-specific manner. Muller and coworkers found CXCR4 to be highly expressed in breast cancer cells, malignant breast tumours and metastases. On the other hand, peak levels of CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)12 occurred in those organs that represent the initial destinations of breast cancer metastasis (i.e. lymph nodes, lung, liver and bone marrow). Furthermore, neutralizing the interaction between CXCL12 and CXCR4 significantly impaired metastasis to regional lymph nodes and lung in mice. Other reports have also shown that the SDF-1/CXCR4 biological axis is involved in regulating metastasis of tumours. In the present study we found that that node-positive tumours had significantly higher levels of SDF-1 than did node-negative tumors, suggesting that SDF-1 may be involved in the lymph node metastatic process. Given that lymph node metastasis directly affects the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, we propose that SDF-1, via the CXCR4 pathway, is potentially a marker of nodal involvement. It was recently reported that SDF-1 can act as a direct target for ER-\u03b1 in breast cancer cells (e.g. MCF-7 cells). In the present study it is noteworthy that EF-negative and ER-\u03b2-negative tumours tended to have higher levels of SDF-1. Although differences between these subgroups were not statistically significant, the trend, together with the in vitro studies, indicate that this link warrants further investigation. It is also noteworthy that SDF-1 expression in mammary tissues was primarily confined to stromal cells and, to some degree, cancer cells. We did not observe SDF-1 staining in vascular endothelial cells, HECV, and in vascular endothelial cells in the tissues \u2013 observations echoed by other studies. This finding indicates that paracrine regulation may be the main pathway in breast cancer but that autocrine pathways may also exist. Secretion and production of SDF-1 are regulated by other factors. For example, expression of SDF-1 is decreased by IL-1, tumour necrosis factor and inflammation, whereas oestradiol can induce the production and secretion of SDF-1 in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, tumour cells exposed to high concentrations of SDF-1 induce reduction in CXCR4 expression. Furthermore, vascular edothelial grwoth factor can also induce CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells. Factors contributing to over-expression of SDF-1 in breast cancer thus warrant further investigation.Finally, we demonstrated a significant correlation between SDF-1 expression and overall and disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer. The high level of SDF-1 expression suggests that there is a high likelihood of node metastasis, local recurrence and death from breast cancer in these patients. We and others found the expression pattern of CXCR4 to be significantly correlated with the degree of lymph node metastases but not with haematogenous metastases. Therefore, SDF-1, together with its receptor CXCR4, may have potential value when assessing long-term clinical outcome in breast cancer.ConclusionThe present study demonstrated that breast cancer cells that express SDF-1, and therefore that have an active SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway, are more invasive and motile, thus have a more aggressive phenotype. In clinical breast cancers, and supported by data from cell lines, we found that SDF-1 appears to exist primarily in stromal cells and, to some degree, in breast cancer cells.

        "content": "Tumor-derived matricellular proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) and tenascin-C (TN-C) have been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis. However, the molecular basis of how these proteins contribute to tumor progression remains to be elucidated. Importantly, these matricellular proteins are known to interact with \u03b19\u03b21 integrin. Therefore, we hypothesized that tumor-derived \u03b19\u03b21 integrin may contribute to tumor progression. To clarify the roles of \u03b19\u03b21 integrin in tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis, we used an inhibitory anti-human \u03b19\u03b21 integrin antibody (anti-h\u03b19\u03b21 antibody) and a \u03b19\u03b21 integrin-positive human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 luc-D3H2LN (D3H2LN), in vitro functional assays, and an in vivo orthotopic xenotransplantation model. In this study, we demonstrated that tumor, but not host \u03b19\u03b21 integrin, contributes to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, recruitment of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and host-derived OPN production. We also found that CAFs contributed to tumor growth, lymphatic metastasis, and host-derived OPN levels. Consistent with those findings, tumor volume was well-correlated with numbers of CAFs and levels of host-derived OPN. Furthermore, it was shown that the inoculation of D3H2LN cells into mammary fat pads with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), obtained from wild type, but not OPN knock-out mice, resulted in enhancement of tumor growth, thus indicating that CAF-derived OPN enhanced tumor growth. These results suggested that tumor \u03b19\u03b21-mediated signaling plays a pivotal role in generating unique primary tumor tissue microenvironments, which favor lymphatic metastasis and tumor growth. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes lymphatic metastasis through enhancing invasion. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin promotes tumor growth through CAFs. Tumor \u03b19\u03b21 integrin enhances the recruitment of CAFs into the primary tumor. Tumor cells induce the production of OPN by CAFs in the primary tumor. CAF-derived OPN promotes tumor growth.",

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen.

Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min. Upper panels, representative images of adherent cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panel, adhesion was quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm). Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay. Left panels, representative images of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 wound healing over time (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a016\u2009h) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm. Right panel, wound healing (wound width, in \u03bcm) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) was quantified over time. The data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment. (D) Cell invasion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroids embedded in collagen I gel were let to invade in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 3\u2009days. Left panels, representative images of invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Right panel, the invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell area was quantified using Image J. Data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test).DISCUSSIONHere, we showed that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed in both tumor and stromal cells, and that its expression in CAFs independently predicts RFS in patients with TNBC. Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics.

        "title": "Heterogeneity of the motility responses in malignant tumor cells: a biological basis for the diversity and homing of metastatic cells.",
        "content": "Tumor metastasis requires highly motile cells that can respond to appropriate stimuli. A2058 human melanoma cells were shown previously to secrete a highly potent autocrine motility factor (AMF) that stimulates chemokinetic movement. We have shown that the insulin polypeptides (IPs; insulin-like growth factors I and II [IGF-I, -II] and insulin) stimulated A2058 cell chemotaxis and chemokinesis. We now report that the IPs and AMF stimulate locomotion in other human malignant cell lines. Insulin (100 nM) induced motility of up to 50% of the magnitude of the AMF response in human carcinoma lines MDA-231 (breast), T24 (bladder), and OVCAR3 (ovarian). The tumorigenic and metastatic 5R Haras-transfected rat embryo fibroblast cell line responded to insulin with both chemotaxis and chemokinesis and was 100% of that seen for AMF. The ED50 for IGF-I in the carcinoma cell lines was in the order of I nM, but the magnitude of the responses at this concentration was 40% of the AMF-stimulated response, with the exception of the A2058 cells, which were maximally stimulated at I nM. IGF-II induced maximal motility of 75 to 130% of the AMF-stimulated response in the carcinoma lines with ED50 of less than or equal to 10 nM. IGF-II-stimulated motility in the carcinoma lines was predominantly chemotactic by modified checkerboard analysis. Cell pretreatment with pertussis toxin inhibited 90-100% of AMF-induced motility, whereas migration to the IPs was not pertussis toxinsusceptible. In growth studies, IGF-I induced mitogenesis up to 140% of basal media control growth. In general, maximal growth stimulation was seen at 100 nM IGF-I, and optimal migration was seen at 10 nM IGF-I. The IGFs are secreted by normal stroma in a number of organs that are common sites for primary and metastatic disease. Therefore, we suggest that IPs may be important homing and mitogenic signals for tumor cells in the process of invasion and metastasis and that the differential motility stimulation and respective mechanisms of action by these physiologically important agents may underlie the diversity of the metastatic process.",

        "full_text": "Rapid intraoperative insulin assay: a novel method to differentiate insulinoma from nesidioblastosis in the pediatric patientIntroductionHyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Although new, improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization of insulinomas, the differentiation of nesidioblastosis and insulinoma, particularly in children, can be challenging. To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection of insulinoma, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, is reported for the first time in a pediatric patient. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma.Case descriptionWe present a case of pancreatic insulinoma in a child with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, causing seizures. The insulinoma was enucleated laparoscopically, and rapid intra-operative insulin assay used to determine the success of the procedure.Discussion and evaluationThis rapid intra-operative test provides a valuable adjunct for determining complete excision in complicated cases of recurrent or questionable insulinoma. Although not a common problem, for pediatric patients in whom the diagnosis is not clear, this test may provide a novel approach to confirming disease.ConclusionWe propose the use of this assay in facilitating intra-operative resection and confirmation of complete excision in pediatric patients. This population may especially benefit from this novel assay to confirm complete resection and to differentiate multiple etiologies of hyperinsulinism.BackgroundHyperinsulinism is the most common cause of recurrent and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. Causes can include nesidioblastosis, pancreatic islet cell tumors such as insulinoma, and associations with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Pancreatic islet cell tumors have an annual incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, with insulinoma being the most common type, accounting for 70% to 80% of all pancreatic endocrine tumors. Peak incidence is in the third and fifth decades of life, but it can occur in all age groups. These tumors are usually solitary, benign, and diagnosed while still small because of clinical presentation of uncontrollable hypoglycemia. Insulinoma is equally distributed throughout the whole pancreatic gland. Preoperative localization is sometimes challenging, with up to 64% not localized at laparotomy. New improved imaging techniques have allowed for more precise preoperative localization. Noninvasive imaging modalities include transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While transabdominal US shows 30% sensitivity in detecting a tumor, conventional CT provides 73% sensitivity. Invasive imaging procedures such as angiography and transhepatic venous hormone sampling are more accurate in detecting tumor, but they are more expensive and depend on the experience of the person performing the study. Sensitivity with angiography is 35% to 65%, and 77% to 100% with transhepatic portal venous sampling. Selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling is another invasive method, with a sensitivity of nearly 100%. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the procedure of choice for tumor localization. With 2\u20133-mm resolution, EUS can be used with radial (diagnostic) or linear (for fine needle aspiration) echoendoscope and allows continuous imaging technique. Accuracy of EUS is 88% and, in combination with biphasic helical CT, increases to 97%. Intraoperative EUS can successfully localize tumors in 90% of cases and can determine tumor size and invasion into the duodenum as well as vascular invasion (portal vein, small mesenteric artery, splenic vein) metastasis into the regional lymph nodes. It may distinguish nonmalignant lesions from pancreatic carcinomas.Even with these diagnostic studies, localization of insulinoma can be difficult, and, especially in the child, must be differentiated from nesidioblastosis. This clinical and pathologic disease involves hyperplasia of the beta cells of the pancreas, which leads to persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI) and can present in adults with organic hyperinsulinism. In infants, the annual incidence is 1 in 50,000 births for the sporadic form, but may be up to 1 in 2,500 births in certain regions. Treatment varies significantly, depending on symptoms, from medical management with diazoxide and chlorothiazide, nifedipine, glucagon, and octreotide to some who require partial or subtotal pancreatectomy. Surgery, however, results in high rates of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency, with long-term complications of diabetes mellitus or malnutrition.To improve intraoperative localization and confirmation of successful resection, a novel hormonal assay, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay, has been developed. This intraoperative radioimmunoassay for insulin yields results within several minutes and confirms complete resection of insulinoma. It determines the level of active insulin molecule in the serum and is checked before insulinoma enucleation and right after enucleation intraoperatively. Although there is little guidance as to precise criteria for gauging success, one proposed protocol is similar to that used for quick parathyroid hormone (PTH) assay (i.e., a 50% drop). When insulin levels drop more than 50% of baseline within several minutes of insulinoma resection, the surgery is considered successful.Here we present a case of pancreatic insulinoma in a child with symptoms of severe hypoglycemia, causing seizures. The insulinoma was enucleated laparoscopically \u2013 a well-accepted technique for appropriately selected lesions. Intraoperative insulin measurements confirmed complete tumor resection. We aim to demonstrate that for the pediatric patient, in particular, the rapid intraoperative insulin assay has many advantages for the surgeon in confirming successful resection of insulin-producing tumors.Case presentationThe patient is a 13-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented in December of 2004 with a general tonic-clonic seizure after a basketball game. Blood glucose was 33 mg/dL. Workup was delayed. He had a second seizure in late January 2005 associated with a glucose level less than 40 mg/dL. At that time the C-peptide level was 8.1 U/dL. The patient was admitted for a 72-hour inpatient fast in late March 2005, and had a seizure at hour 18 of the fast. His glucose was 33 mg/dL with an insulin level equal to 21 U/dL, confirming the diagnosis of insulinoma. CT scanning and MRI were performed and demonstrated a 1.8 cm mass in the neck of the pancreas. After several additional seizures he was referred to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital for evaluation and admitted from the office for glucose monitoring and preoperative preparation. The patient underwent intraoperative US followed by laparoscopic enucleation of a pancreatic islet cell tumor.Operative procedureAn arterial line was inserted to allow frequent glucose testing during the operative procedure. The patient's baseline glucose level was 54 mg/dL with a baseline insulin level of 125 U/dL (normal 10\u201386 U/dL). Glucose solution was administered intraoperatively to maintain a blood glucose level greater than 100 mg/dL. After induction of general anesthesia and positioning in the modified lithotomy position, the abdomen was insufflated to 15 mm Hg with CO2. Two 12 mm trocars and three 5 mm trocars were inserted and the lesser sac entered through the omentum, preserving the right gastroepiploic vessels to expose the anterior surface of the pancreas. The inferior aspect of the pancreas was then mobilized to allow inspection of the posterior surface. The splenic vein was clearly identified and dissected. The pancreas was dissected medially and a space posterior to the pancreas and anterior to the portal vein was developed. Laparoscopic US identified a hypoechoic mass in the neck of the pancreas, which was enucleated using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection techniques. The lesion was placed in a retrieval sac and extracted.Intraoperative insulin levels of 172 U/dL were measured after initial identification of the insulinoma. At 5 and 10 minutes postexcision, values dropped to 87 U/dL and 68 U/dL, respectively, demonstrating complete resection. Total operating time was 120 minutes. Postoperatively, the patient's blood glucose increased to 130 mg/dL.The patient developed a pancreatic fistula postoperatively, which was initially controlled via drainage catheter and conservative measures, but ultimately required re-exploration with a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient subsequently recovered without complication and final pathology showed a 1.4 \u00d7 1.2 \u00d7 0.9 cm, well-differentiated, intermediate grade insulinoma.Rapid insulin assayTo determine insulin levels intraoperatively, we used the STAT-IntraOperative-System (Future Diagnostics, Arlington, MA). This is a chemiluminescence immunoassay for the quantitative determination of insulin levels in human serum and EDTA plasma. The assay uses two monoclonal antibodies against insulin. Patient samples are introduced into wells and incubated for 7 minutes. The washed wells are then placed into the STAT-Read, which calculates insulin levels by measuring emissions of light in relative light units. The time between obtaining a blood sample and reading a result is under 12 minutes.Discussion and evaluationThis rapid intraoperative test gives us a valuable adjunct for determining complete excision in complicated cases of recurrent or questionable insulinoma. Although not a common problem, for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, this test may provide a novel approach to confirmation. This is especially the case for the pediatric patient. In this report, we highlight the utility of the rapid intraoperative insulin assay as an effective and unique method to confirm curative resection of insulinoma in the pediatric patient, a population where other hyperinsulin-producing conditions, such as nesidioblastosis, must be considered as well. In children, the etiology of hyperinsulinism can be a diagnostic challenge. This assay may represent particular utility intraoperatively to confirm curative resection.Rapid determination of insulin levels with detection of C-peptide is a new modality for diagnosing insulinoma. C-peptide is a 31 amino acid fragment, which is split from the proinsulin molecule to form bioactive insulin in the serum. The analysis is performed by radioimmunoassay and can be done using serum from peripheral blood in a rapid time period. Insulin has a short serum half-life of about 5 minutes; 50% is cleared by the liver and 30% by the kidneys. Several authors have reported the use of intraoperative insulin monitoring during resection of insulinomas in adults, in an attempt to improve intraoperative resection and outcome. Although intraoperative assays for parathyroidectomy are well established and available in many centers \u2013 they are currently the most widely used intraoperative means for hormone measurement in the United States \u2013 the rapid insulin assay is more complicated, is not as widely available, and requires a dedicated team in order to ensure reproducibility and reliability. This assay is a valuable technique that, when performed well, can serve as a useful adjunct to the management and operative resection of patients with known or suspected insulinoma. Our goal is to raise awareness regarding this technique and potential applications that may be useful to the surgeon.Treatment of insulinoma is by surgical resection. However, the surgeon may not know preoperatively if the insulinoma is single or multiple or present in a background of islet cell hyperplasia. To answer these questions, the rapid intraoperative serum insulin assay may be useful. In this case report we have presented a child with an insulinoma for whom intraoperative insulin measurements determined completeness of excision with subsequent cure. Postoperatively, the patient remained normoglycemic and all biochemical parameters returned to normal.ConclusionIn conclusion, we present a confirmatory case demonstrating the utility of the rapid intraoperative insulin assay in facilitating intraoperative resection and confirmation of complete excision of insulinoma for the first time in a pediatric patient. This population may especially benefit from this novel assay to confirm complete resection and to differentiate multiple etiologies of hyperinsulinism in the pediatric population.Competing interestsThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsPerformed Surgery: VES, WBIPreparation of Manuscript: VES, AS, WBICritical Review and Corrections: VES, WBIAll authors read and approved the final manuscript.Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in infancy and childhood \u2013 resolving the enigmaLaparoscopic pancreatic surgery for islet cell tumors of the pancreasResults of a prospective strategy to diagnose, localize, and resect insulinomasLocalization of islet cell tumors of the pancreas: a review of current techniquesValue of tumor localization in patients with insulinomaAssessment of selective arterial calcium stimulation and hepatic venous sampling to localize insulin-secreting tumoursValue of intra-arterial calcium stimulated venous sampling for regionalization of pancreatic insulinomasEndoscopic ultrasonography for the preoperative localization of insulinomasNoninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome: an update in 10 surgically treated patientsPractical management of hyperinsulinism in infancyNesidioblastosis: an old term and a new understandingLaparoscopic pancreatic resection: single-institution experience of 19 patientsLaparoscopic localization and resection of insulinomasLaparoscopic enucleation of a solitary pancreatic insulinomaIntraoperative insulin measurement during surgical management of insulinomasEvaluation of a new fully automated one-step C-peptide chemiluminescence assay (LIAISON C-Peptid)Evaluation of preoperative and intraoperative arterial stimulation and venous sampling for diagnosis and surgical resection of insulinomaRole of intraoperative insulin monitoring in surgical management of insulinomaRapid insulin assay for intraoperative confirmation of complete resection ofinsulinomas"

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

        "content": "From a murine breast cancer cell line, 4T1, we established a subclone, 4T1.3, which consistently metastasizes to bone upon its injection into the mammary fat pad. 4T1.3 clone exhibited similar proliferation rate and migration capacity as the parental clone. However, the intra-bone injection of 4T1.3 clone caused larger tumors than that of the parental cells, accompanied with increases in fibroblast, but not osteoclast or osteoblast numbers. 4T1.3 clone displayed an enhanced expression of a chemokine, CCL4, but not its specific receptor, CCR5. CCL4 shRNA-transfection of 4T1.3 clone had few effects on its in vitro properties, but reduced the tumorigenicity arising from the intra-bone injection. Moreover, intra-bone injection of 4T1.3 clone caused smaller tumors in mice deficient in CCR5 or those receiving CCR5 antagonist than in wild-type mice. The reduced tumor formation was associated with attenuated accumulation of CCR5-positive fibroblasts expressing connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)/CCN2. Tumor cell-derived CCL4 could induce fibroblasts to express CTGF/CCN2, which could support 4T1.3 clone proliferation under hypoxic culture conditions. Thus, the CCL4-CCR5 axis can contribute to breast cancer metastasis to bone by mediating the interaction between cancer cells and fibroblasts in bone cavity.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

CAF PD-L1 expression did not correlate with any clinical factors, including age, menopausal status, or presence of adjuvant chemotherapy. Only TIL PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with CAF PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CAF PD-L1 expression according to the SP-142 and E1L3N assays was also significantly associated with TIL PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u00a00.001 for both), similar to the 73\u201310 assay (Tables\u00a03, 4). Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative RFSThe median RFS in CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively. The median RFS in CAF PD-L1-negative patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 47, 53, and 49\u2009months, respectively.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "Chemotherapy heavily relies on apoptosis to kill breast cancer (BrCa) cells. Many breast tumors respond to chemotherapy, but cells that survive this initial response gain resistance to subsequent treatments. This leads to aggressive cell variants with an enhanced ability to migrate, invade and survive at secondary sites. Metastasis and chemoresistance are responsible for most cancer-related deaths; hence, therapies designed to minimize both are greatly needed. We have recently shown that CCR9-CCL25 interactions promote BrCa cell migration and invasion, while others have shown that this axis play important role in T cell survival. In this study we have shown potential role of CCR9-CCL25 axis in breast cancer cell survival and therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, Vybrant apoptosis and TUNEL assays were performed to ascertain the role of CCR9-CCL25 axis in cisplatin-induced apoptosis of BrCa cells. Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE) assay was used to quantify In situ activation of PI3Kp85, AktSer473, GSK-3\u03b2Ser9 and FKHRThr24 in breast cancer cells with or without cisplatin treatment in presence or absence of CCL25.

Many breast tumors respond to chemotherapy, but cells that survive this initial response gain resistance to subsequent treatments. This leads to aggressive cell variants with an enhanced ability to migrate, invade and survive at secondary sites. Metastasis and chemoresistance are responsible for most cancer-related deaths; hence, therapies designed to minimize both are greatly needed. We have recently shown that CCR9-CCL25 interactions promote BrCa cell migration and invasion, while others have shown that this axis play important role in T cell survival. In this study we have shown potential role of CCR9-CCL25 axis in breast cancer cell survival and therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin.MethodsBromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, Vybrant apoptosis and TUNEL assays were performed to ascertain the role of CCR9-CCL25 axis in cisplatin-induced apoptosis of BrCa cells. Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE) assay was used to quantify In situ activation of PI3Kp85, AktSer473, GSK-3\u03b2Ser9 and FKHRThr24 in breast cancer cells with or without cisplatin treatment in presence or absence of CCL25.ResultsCCR9-CCL25 axis provides survival advantage to BrCa cells and inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-independent fashion.

These results show that CCR9-CCL25 axis play important role in BrCa cell survival and low chemotherapeutic efficacy of cisplatin primarily through PI3K/Akt dependent fashion.IntroductionBreast cancer (BrCa) is second leading cause of cancer related deaths among women after lung cancer. It is estimated that 207,090 women will be diagnosed with BrCa in 2010 and 39,480 will die from this disease in United States. Cisplatin and its analogues have been widely used to treat human cancers including BrCa. Unfortunately, many tumors become resistant to cisplatin, which is characterized by decreased susceptibility to apoptosis. Cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy primarily by inactivating apoptotic factors and/or enhancing cell survival pathways.Chemokines are a group of small proteins (8 - 10 kDa), structurally related molecules that regulate trafficking of lymphocytes through interactions with a subset of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors. To this end, we have recently shown significantly higher expression of CCR9 in ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines and tumors. CCR9-CCL25 interactions known to support T cells survival during thymic maturation by inhibiting apoptosis through Akt/protein kinase B activation, which is PI3K- and G\u03b1i protein-dependent. Indeed, the PI3K/Akt anti-apoptotic and survival pathway plays a crucial role in cisplatin resistance. FAK has also been shown to support anti-apoptotic mechanisms through Akt signaling. Chemokine receptors may also aggregate with integrins following stimulation to promote FAK phosphorylation.This study investigates the role of CCR9-CCL25 interactions and requirement for PI3K and FAK activation in BrCa cell survival and cisplatin resistance. We show for the first time that CCR9-CCL25 interactions provide protection from cisplatin-induced BrCa cell death. We also show that CCR9-CCL25 interaction promotes cell proliferation and upregulated anti-apoptotic signaling, which is mediated by the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, independent of FAK. These studies suggest that the expression of functional CCR9 may facilitate BrCa cell survival and low chemotherapeutic response.Materials and methodsCell cultureHuman BrCa cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, were obtained from ATCC. These cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Prior to each experiment, cells were cultured for 24 hours in RPMI 1640 with 1% FBS to serum starve the cells.Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assayBrCa cells (105) were cultured alone or with 100 ng/mL CCL25 + 1 \u03bcg/mL of isotype control antibody or 100 ng/mL CCL25 + 1 \u03bcg/mL anti-CCR9 antibody (clone 112509, R&D Systems) for 24 hours with 0, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, or 50 \u03bcg/mL of cisplatin. Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into newly synthesized DNA permits indirect detection of rapidly proliferating cells. Hence, this assay was used according to manufacturer's instructions to estimate BrCa cell growth. Briefly, cells were treated with BrdU for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C. Media containing labelling solution was removed and cells were washed twice with media containing 10% serum. BrCa cells were fixed with 200 \u03bcL of fixative solution for 30 minutes at ~25\u00b0C and washed as before. Next, cells were incubated with 100 \u03bcL of nuclease solution for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C and washed 3 times. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcL of anti-BrdU antibody was added, incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, and washed 3 times. BrdU incorporation by BrCa cells was detected by peroxidase substrate reaction. After the extinction of this reaction, the samples were measured in a micro plate reader at 405 nm with a reference wavelength at approximately 490 nm.Vybrant apoptosis assayBrCa cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media with 5 \u03bcg/ml of cisplatin (IC50), along with no additions or 100 ng/mL of CCL25 or 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-CCR9 Ab or 100 ng/mL of CCL25 plus 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-CCR9 Ab for 24 hours. The cells were harvested and washed in ice-cold PBS. Cells (105 cells/mL) were stained with Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI) using the Vybrant apoptosis assay Kit #3 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using UV/488 nm dual excitation and measuring the fluorescence emission at approximately 530 nm and 575 nm.Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) AssayBrCa cells were cultured with 0 or 5 \u03bcg/ml (IC50) of cisplatin, along with no additions or 100 ng/mL of CCL25 plus 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-CCR9 or isotype control antibodies for 24 hours. Apoptosis was measured by TUNEL assay (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, following treatment the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 for 15 minutes. After washing in PBS three times, the cells were incubated with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for 15 minutes. After washing in PBS, the cells were incubated with TdT end-labelling cocktail for 60 minutes. Termination buffer was added to stop the reaction. After washing 4 times in PBS, cells were blocked for 20 minutes and stained with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) solution for 30 minutes. After washing with PBS 3 times, fluorescence plate reader quantified the fluorescence of TUNEL positive cells.Fast activated cell-based ELISA (FACE)The levels of total and active (phosphorylated) PI3Kp85, AktSer473, GSK-3\u03b2Ser9, and FKHRThr24 were quantified using Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE) assays (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates one day prior to manipulation. BrCa cells were cultured in serum-free media with 0 or 5 \u03bcg/ml of cisplatin or 100 ng/ml of CCL25 or 5 \u03bcg/mL of cisplatin with 100 ng/mL of CCL25 for 24 hours. In addition, cells were treated with or without kinase inhibitors of PI3K (wortmannin; Sigma) and FAK (PF-573, 228;Pfizer).StatisticsThe data were compared using a two-tailed Student's t test and expressed as the mean \u00b1 SE. The results were analyzed using the Statview II program (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley CA) and were labeled statistically significant if p values were < 0.01.ResultsEffects of CCL25 on cisplatin-induced growth inhibitionCCL25 significantly enhanced the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison to untreated (cisplatin-free BrCa) cells (Figure 1). While cisplatin concentrations of \u2264 1 \u03bcg/mL had no major effect on either CCL25-treated or untreated BrCa cell growth, 2 \u03bcg/mL of cisplatin reduced cell proliferation of untreated, but not CCL25-treated cells. In fact, CCL25 significantly protected cisplatin (< 5 \u03bcg/mL)-mediated growth inhibition. As the concentration of cisplatin reached \u2265 10 \u03bcg/mL, the effect of CCL25-mediated protection of cisplatin-induced BrCa cell growth inhibition dissipated. Importantly, the significant increases of BrCa cell proliferation and cisplatin-dependent growth inhibition caused by CCL25 treatment was abrogated by CCR9 blockade.CCL25 inhibits cisplatin-induced reductions in cell growth. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with 0 or 100 ng/ml of CCL25 plus isotype control or anti-CCR9 Ab (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 hours, along with increasing concentrations of cisplatin (0-50 \u03bcg/mL). Cell proliferation was determined by BrdU incorporation in triplicate and was repeated 3 times. Asterisks (*) indicate significant differences (p < 0.01) between CCL25-treated and untreated BrCa cells.CCL25-induced survival and cisplatin resistance of breast cancer cellsCisplatin treatment resulted in a ~5 fold increase in apoptotic cells, relative to the untreated cells (Figure 2A). However, CCL25 significantly decreased the percentage of cisplatin-treated apoptotic cells, compared to untreated or anti-CCR9 Ab treated cells. As with growth inhibition, the decrease in the percentage of cisplatin-induced apoptotic cells (or increase in cell survival) afforded by CCL25 was abolished by CCR9 inhibition. Apoptosis was also assessed under the same conditions by TUNEL analysis (Figure 2B). BrCa cells treated with cisplatin showed an increase in apoptosis as compare to the untreated cells. However, similar cisplatin-treated cells co-cultured with CCL25 displayed significantly low apoptotic or TUNEL-positive events, which was abrogated after CCR9 blockade.Cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Panel A: MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 24 hours with 5.0 \u03bcg/ml of cisplatin with or without CCL25 (100 ng/mL) plus 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-human CCR9 or isotype controls. Cells were stained with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Analysis by flow cytometry of the stained cells distinguished apoptotic (annexin V positive) cells from viable (no fluorescence) and necrotic (PI positive) cells. Asterisks (*) indicate significant differences (p < 0.01) between CCL25-treated and untreated BrCa cells. Panel B: MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 24 hours with 5.0 \u03bcg/mL cisplatin or with 0 or 100 ng/ml of CCL25 plus anti-human CCR9 or isotype control Abs (1 \u03bcg/mL). Detection of apoptotic cells was carried out using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. Apoptotic cells exhibited nuclear green fluorescence with a standard fluorescence filter set (520 \u00b1 20 nm).CCR9-CCL25-interactions lead to PI3K p85, Akt, GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR activationTo identify the cellular signals involved in cisplatin resistance mediated by CCR9-CCL25 interaction, in situ PI3K p85, Akt, GSK-3\u03b2, and FKHR phosphorylation levels were quantified by FACE assay. Cisplatin alone had no significant effect on PI3K activity in comparison to untreated cells (Figure 3A). CCL25 induced a rapid increase in PI3Kp85 activation after 5 minutes, which continued through 10 minutes in the presence or absence of cisplatin. As expected, treatment with wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor prevented CCL25-dependent increases in PI3K activity in all samples. In contrast, FAK inhibition had no effect on CCL25-mediated PI3Kp85 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the immediate increase in PI3K activation by CCL25 and cisplatin co-cultured cells was moderately attenuated by FAK inhibition.PI3K and Akt activation by CCR9-CCL25 interactions. MDA-MB-231 cells were tested for their ability to activate PI3K and Akt following treatment with CCL25, cisplatin and specific kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and PF-573, 228). In situ total and active (phosphorylated) PI3K and Akt levels were quantified by Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE) assay before (0 minutes) or after (5 or 10 minutes) CCL25 stimulation in the presence of cisplatin and kinase inhibitors.The active (phosphorylated) to total Akt protein ratio in BrCa cells not treated with CCL25 was approximately 2:1 (Figure 3B). Treatment with cisplatin alone had no effect on Akt activity. There was a significant increase in Akt phosphorylation \u2265 5 minutes after CCL25 treatment. This CCL25-mediated Akt activity was partially reduced by cisplatin co-culture. Wortmannin treated cells were non-responsive to CCL25 stimulation, while FAK inhibition had no effect on CCL25-mediated Akt phosphorylation.Activated Akt phosphorylates and inactivates the anti-proliferative effects of GSK-3\u03b2. In the presence or absence of cisplatin, CCL25 significantly increased GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation \u2265 5 minutes after treatment (Figure 4A). Wortmannin pre-treatment completely removed this effect. However, FAK inhibition did not significantly alter GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation by CCL25 with or without cisplatin co-culture.GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR phosphorylation following CCL25 treatment. MDA-MB-231 cells were tested for their ability to phosphorylate GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR following treatment with CCL25, cisplatin and specific-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and PF-573, 228). In situ total and active (phosphorylated) GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR levels were quantified by Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE) assay before (0 minutes) or after (5 or 10 minutes) CCL25 stimulation in the presence of cisplatin and kinase inhibitors.Akt also inactivates FKHR through phosphorylation, which leads to anti-apoptotic events or cell survival. CCL25 induced a significant and rapid increase in FKHR phosphorylation levels in either cisplatin-free or -treated BrCa cells (Figure 4B). Wortmannin treatment eliminated this effect. However, FAK-inhibition had no effect on CCL25-mediated FKHR phosphorylation.DiscussionAccording to the American Cancer Society, in 2010, 207,090 women will be diagnosed with BrCa and about 39,840 women will die from the disease. Although death rates have been declining since 1990, BrCa mortality is high among African American women. Many of these deaths are due to chemo-resistance, which is a common problem in the treatment of BrCa. Cisplatin and its analogues have been widely used for treatment of human cancers, including advanced BrCa. However, resistance to cisplatin represents a major obstacle in the effective management of metastatic BrCa. The balance between survival and apoptotic signals in cancer cells determine the sensitivity to chemotherapy and cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapies by inactivating apoptotic factors and enhancing survival pathways. However, the factors that promote these remain incompletely understood.Chemokines direct the migration of leukocytes as well as cancer cells and they play a pivotal role in cell survival. Interactions between CXCR4 and its ligand, CXCL12, promote the survival of breast, pancreatic cancers, and melanoma. CCR9-CCL25 interactions also potentiate anti-apoptotic signaling to immature, or double-positive T cells, and function to retain single positive cells in the thymus until they are fully mature and ready for export.We have demonstrated that CCR9 is significantly expressed by ovarian and prostate cells and play important role in cell migration and invasion. Here we show that CCR9 also supports BrCa cell growth as well as cell survival or resistance to cisplatin. CCL25 significantly increases BrCa cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance in a CCR9-dependent fashion.It has been previously shown that CCR9 signaling plays a role in immature T cell survival through PI3K and G\u03b1i protein-dependent activation of Akt/protein kinase B. Downstream PI3K mediators directly phosphorylate and activate Akt. PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are also frequently disturbed in many human cancers and evidence suggests that chemokine receptor signaling activates Akt. Akt modulates the function of numerous substrates involved in the regulation of cell survival, cell cycle progression and cellular growth. The PI3K/Akt pathway is also involved in chemoresistance to cisplatin. Phosphorylated Akt promotes survival by phosphorylating and inactivating pro-apoptotic factors, such as GSK-3\u03b2 and or FKHR. GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition by Akt prevents phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin, which impedes its degradation; hence, it is translocated to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, \u03b2-catenin combines with different transcription factors to induce the expression of several genes, such as cyclin D1. Hence, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 prevents the accumulation of cyclin D1, which is needed to support cell cycle progression. FKHR transactivates the expression of death activating proteins, such as Fas ligand (FasL), Bim, and Bcl-6. Phosphorylating FKHR1 at its threonine and serine residues prevents its translocation to the nucleus and any associated gene transcription.Our studies strongly support the hypothesis that CCR9-CCL25 signaling enhances BrCa cell growth and survival. Specifically, we show that CCL25 induces the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and phosphorylation of its downstream mediators, e.g., GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR. PI3K inhibition completely abrogated CCL25-mediated and CCR9-dependent cisplatin resistance, Akt, GSK-3\u03b2, and FKHR phosphorylation. However, it was also plausible that other Akt-activation pathways supported BrCa cell survival following cisplatin (and CCL25) treatment. In this regard, chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions also support integrin clustering to potentially activate FAK, which is a protein tyrosine kinase involved in cell proliferation, migration and survival. Activated FAK also interacts with PI3K through integrin clustering. However, our findings show that FAK is not involved in CCL25-mediated and CCR9-dependent Akt activation or subsequent GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR phosphorylation.In support of our findings, a recent study has shown that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is an important event downstream of amphiregulin for the development of cisplatin resistance in BrCa cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CCL25 treatment induces BrCa cell survival and cisplatin resistance. We also show that CCR9-dependent anti-apoptotic signaling involves the PI3K/Akt pathway and phosphorylation of its downstream mediators, GSK-3\u03b2 and FKHR - through CCR9 and PI3K/Akt, but independent of FAK, supporting our hypothesis that CCR9-CCL25 interaction promotes BrCa cell survival and resistance to cisplatin.ConclusionThese results suggest that CCR9-CCL25 axis play significant role in BrCa cell survival and cisplatin resistance primarily through PI3K/Akt dependent fashion.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsCJH conducted the experiments, analyzed data and drafted the manuscript.

Most recent studies indicate that breast cancer is mainly caused by breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), and the cure for breast cancer requires BCSCs be eradicated. In 2003, Clarke and colleagues demonstrated that a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of BCSCs, expressing CD44+CD24- surface marker in clinical specimen, had the capacity to form tumors with as few as one hundred cells, whereas tens of thousands of the bulk breast cancer cells did not. The concept of a cancer stem cell within a tumor mass, as an aberrant form of normal differentiation, is now gaining acceptance. In order to simplify research procedure, some cancer cell lines were used to study BCSCs instead of patient samples, because they were found to have cancer stem-like cell potential. For instance, mammosphere cells were found to enrich breast cancer stem-like cells with the phenotype of CD44+CD24- .Until now, studies on breast cancer onset and development have been mainly focused on the epithelial components of the tumor, paying little attention to the surrounding tumor stromal niche. However, new evidences have emerged suggesting an important interaction between mammary epithelia and the adjacent tumor stroma. For example, only normal fibroblasts (NFs) but not carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) exhibit the ability to inhibit the proliferation of the tumorigenic MCF10AT, suggesting that the ability of normal stromal fibroblasts to control the dysregulation of epithelial cell proliferation during breast carcinogenesis. In addition, the gene expression profile of stromal fibroblasts varies widely during cancer progression, among which it includes many genes encoding secreted proteins, such as chemokines.Chemokines are a superfamily of small molecule chemoattractive cytokines that mediate several cellular functions. SDF-1 is a member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines, and interacts with the seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor CXCR4. It is expressed by stromal cells, including fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Normal primary mammary epithelial cells derived from different donors do not express CXCR4 mRNA. In contrast, functional CXCR4 is widely expressed by different types of cancer cells. In addition, CXCR4 is found to be expressed in numerous types of embryonic and adult stem cells, which can be chemoattracted by its ligand SDF-1. Thus, it is likely that SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling plays an important role in stem cell function during the early development.Recently, it has been reported that dysregulation in the mammary gland niche lead to abnormal expression of transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF\u03b1), resulting in the development of breast cancer. Moreover, vascular niches in brain tumors were detected to be abnormal and contributed directly to the generation of cancer stem cells and tumor growth. Based on these experimental data, we hypothesized that dysregulation of the stromal niche lead to uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells, which may be the reason for tumorigenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the expression of BCSC markers in secondary mammosphere cells and promoted the tumorigenicity of mammosphere cells in NOD/SCID mice. In addition, we proposed that SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling is involved in the cell proliferation of these cultured mammosphere cells.Materials and methodsMammosphere culture and dissociationIn our previous studies, we have showed that MCF7 cell line had the highest mammosphere-forming efficiency (MFE) among many breast cancer cells, so MCF7 cells were chosen to generate mammosphere cells in vitro. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and cultured in suspension at a density of 2 \u00d7 105/bottle in DMEM/F12 (HyClone, Logan, Utah) with high glucose, supplemented with 1 \u00d7 B27 (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor I (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 20 ng/ml b-FGF (Invitrogen). In all experiments, cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere. When MCF7 cells were grown in suspension for six days, \"primary mammospheres\" were obtained, then collected by gravity or gentle centrifugation (800 g, 10 sec), and trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA-4Na (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA). These cells were sieved through a 40-\u03bcm nylon mesh, analyzed microscopically for single cellularity and counted. The \"secondary mammospheres\" were generated in culture of 2 \u00d7 105 primary mammosphere cells/bottle in the same media.Flow cytometryCD24 and CD44 expression was analyzed in cells derived from monolayer cultures or in 6-day-cultured primary mammospheres following incubation in trypsin-EDTA or dissociation with a pipette and passage through a 40-\u03bcm sieve. At least 1 \u00d7 105 cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, resuspended in 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD24 monoclonal antibody and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego), and incubated at 4\u00b0C in the dark for 30 to 40 min. The labeled cells were washed and then analyzed on a FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) Vantage (BD Biosciences).Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)After mammosphere cells were sorted, total RNA was extracted by using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and used for qRT-PCR assays in an ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (ABI, Norwalk, Connecticut). The specific PCR primers were used to detect the presence of Notch2 (F: TATTGATGACTGCCCTAA CCACA; R: ATAGCCTCCATTGCGGTTGG), \u03b2-catenin (F: CCTTTGTCCCGCAA ATCATG; R: ACGTACGGCGCTGGGTATC), CXCR4 (F: TACACCGAGGAAATG GGCTCA; R: TTCTTCACGGAAACAGGGTTC), SDF-1 (F: ATGCCCATGCCGA TTCTTCG; R: GCCGGGCTACAATCTGAAGG) and GAPDH (F: ATGGGGAAGG TGAAGGTCG; R: GGGGTCATTGATGGCAACAATA). All reactions were done in a 10-\u03bcl reaction volume in triplicate. PCR amplification consisted of 10 min of an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C, followed by 55 cycles of PCR at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 56\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 15 sec. Standard curves were generated and the relative amount of target gene mRNA was normalized to GAPDH. Specificity was verified by melt curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.Antagonist reagentsMammosphere cells and monolayer cells of 2 \u00d7 105 were cultured in medium (2 ml), and AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCR4, was added to the medium at 1 \u03bcg/ml. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 48 hours. qRT-PCR was used to detect CXCR4 expression in mammosphere cells and monolayer cells. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate.Tissue collection and cell preparationBreast cancer specimens were collected from primary tumors of 4 patients who underwent surgery at Xinhua hospital. Signed informed consent was obtained from all the patients. For comparison, we have also obtained normal tissue from healthy women after plastic surgery. The tissues were minced and dissociated in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin, 5 mg/ml insulin, 300 U/ml collagenase and 100 U/ml hyaluronidase (all from Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. The epithelial-cell-rich pellet was collected by centrifuging at 80 g for 4 min, followed by one wash with DMEM/F12. The supernatant from the first centrifugation was used as a source of mammary stromal fibroblasts. Briefly, the first supernatant were concentrated by centrifugation at 100 g for 10 min, and the obtained mammary stromal fibroblasts were resuspended and cultured in flasks in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sijiqing, Hangzhou, China) and 5 mg/ml insulin. Differential trypsinization was applied during subculturing to select for the growth of fibroblasts.ImmunohistochemistryCoverslips with attached cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 5 min, and then stained with anti-human \u03b1-SMA (Dako, Denmark) antibody according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells showing light brown or yellow brown grains in the cytoplasm were classified as positively staining.Coculture of breast stromal fibroblasts with primary mammosphere cellsCoculture of primary mammosphere cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/dish) with breast stromal fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105 cells/dish) were performed by using a transwell (BD) cell culture system, which allows free diffusion of substances without contact between cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts. Stromal fibroblasts in the insert layer were subcultured on a transwell cell culture membrane (7.5 cm in diameter; pore size: 0.4 \u03bcm), and mammosphere cells in the bottom layer were maintained in a 10-cm Petri dish. Stromal fibroblasts were precultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS for 48 h before the start of coculture. Stromal fibroblasts were maintained in fresh serum-free DMEM/F12 medium, and mammosphere cells were cultured in suspension for six days.Coinoculation of mammosphere cells with different stromal fibroblasts in vivoMammospheres and fibroblasts were collected, enzymatically dissociated, washed in PBS, and kept at 4\u00b0C. Mice were maintained in laminar flow rooms under constant temperature and humidity and received an estradiol supplementation (0.6 mg/kg, s.i., Sigma) every 7 days for 28 days before cell injection. The mammosphere cells (1 \u00d7 105) admixed with either CAFs (1 \u00d7 105) or NFs (1 \u00d7 105) were suspended in 0.1 ml of DMEM/F12 and then inoculated into the mammary fat pad of 5-week-old female NOD/SCID mice (Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China). Mice were examined by palpation for tumor formation for up to 12 weeks, and then were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The histologic features of the xenografts were examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. All experimentation performed with NOD/SCID mice, as well as routine care of the animals, was carried out in accordance with the institutional guide of animal care & use committee.Measurement of SDF-1The baseline level of SDF-1 production was determined by coculture of mammosphere cells with stromal fibroblasts for six days at a density of 1 \u00d7 105/bottle. The concentration of SDF-1 in the supernatant was measured by using a human SDF-1 antibody and enzyme immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software\u00a9 (San Diego, CA). Student's t-test (for comparison between two groups) or ANOVA with Tukey post test (for comparison between more than two groups) were used to determine whether there exists statistically significance. Fisher exact probability test was used to analyze tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID mice. Data is presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. P values of \u2264 0.05 were regarded as being statistically significant.ResultsPrimary mammosphere cells expressed higher BCSC markers and genes associated with stem cellsIn order to validate the generation of cancer stem-like cells through mammosphere culture, flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of BCSC marker on primary mammosphere cells and monolayer culture cells. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, when mammospheres were cultured in suspension for six days, the proportion of CD44+CD24- cells were significantly increased as compared with that of MCF7 monolayer cells (7.9 \u00b1 0.8% vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.1%, P < 0.01), which suggest that mammosphere cells can be used to enrich BCSCs. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis indicated that stem cell associated genes, such as Notch2 and \u03b2-catenin, were expressed in mammosphere cells at higher levels than that in monolayer cells (Fig. 1B).Mammosphere cells contained subpopulations of cells expressing prospective BCSC markers. (A) FACS analysis to measure CD44 and CD24 expression of cells derived from MCF7 monolayer cultures (left) or primary mammospheres (right), which were cultured in suspension for six days. The expression of CD44+CD24- in mammosphere cells was (7.9 \u00b1 0.8%), compared with (1.9 \u00b1 0.1%) for the monolayer culture cells, P < 0.01. A minimum of 10,000 events were collected per sample. (B) qRT-PCR showed that Notch2 and \u03b2-catenin mRNA expression in mammosphere cells were at higher levels by around 4.0 and 3.1 fold than that in monolayer cells, respectively, P <0.01. The data were provided as the mean \u00b1 SD. Each experiment was performed three times.CAFs expressed high levels of \u03b1-SMAPrimary stromal fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ml insulin, and no epithelial cells were detected in passage 3 stromal fibroblasts. Although the morphology and growth pattern of CAFs and NFs was similar (Fig. 2A), immunohistochemical staining showed that CAFs exhibited strongly positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, whereas NFs did not (Fig. 2B). In addition, this increased expression of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs was maintained for up to eight passages in vitro, indicating that isolated CAFs contained a high proportion of myofibroblasts.Immunohistochemistry of NFs and CAFs. (A) Phase images of primary cultures of stromal fibroblasts isolated from invasive ductal carcinomas (right) and stromal fibroblasts from normal breast tissue (left), original magnification \u00d7 100. (B) CAFs (right) were positive for \u03b1-SMA staining, while NFs (left) were negative.CAFs promoted the generation of CD44+CD24- cells in mammosphere cellsTo determine whether CAFs affect the generation of cancer stem-like cells in mammosphere cells, we cocultured primary mammosphere cells with stromal fibroblasts in transwells for six days. It was observed that cocultured mammosphere cells with CAFs siginicantly increased MFE (13.5 \u00b1 1.2% vs. 8.1 \u00b1 0.7, P < 0.01), and mammosphere cell number (3.82 \u00b1 0.41 \u00d7 105 vs. 1.51 \u00b1 0.43, P < 0.01) as compared to that of mammosphere cells culture alone. In contrast, NFs markedly inhibit MFE (5.2 \u00b1 0.6 % vs. 8.1 \u00b1 0.7, P < 0.05), and cell number (0.65 \u00b1 0.22 \u00d7 105 vs. 1.51 \u00b1 0.43, P < 0.01) as compared to that of mammosphere cells culture alone (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). In addition, we used flow cytometry to assess the proportion of BCSCs that has the phenotypic marker of CD44+CD24-, and found that CAFs significantly increased the proportion of CD44+CD24- cells in mammospheres (21.4 \u00b1 1.8% vs. 17.2 \u00b1 2.3%, P < 0.05); while NFs decreased the proportion of CD44+CD24- cells in mammospheres (8.7 \u00b1 0.9% vs. 17.2 \u00b1 2.3%, P < 0.01) (Fig. 3B, and see Additional file 1), which exhibited similar trend as MFE. These results suggest that CAFs have positive effects on the generation of CD44+CD24- cells, while NFs have negative effects on CD44+CD24- cell formation.Different MFE and cell number when cocultured with different stromal fibroblastsCulture Condition\tMFE (%)\tCell Number (\u00d7 105)\t \tMonoculture\t8.1 \u00b1 0.7\t1.51 \u00b1 0.43\t \tMammosphere + CAFs\t13.5 \u00b1 1.2**\t3.82 \u00b1 0.41**\t \tMammosphere + NFs\t5.2 \u00b1 0.6*\t0.65 \u00b1 0.22*\t \t*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 compared with monocultureMammosphere cells were cocultured with different stromal fibroblasts and flow cytometry was used to measure CD44 and CD24 expression. (A) Mammosphere cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/dish) cocultured with different stromal fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 105 cells/dish) using transwells for six days, and mammosphere cells cocultured with CAFs (middle) had the highest MFE (13.5 \u00b1 1.2%), compared with monoculture mammosphere cells (left) (8.1 \u00b1 0.7%), P < 0.01. (B) Flow cytometry analysis to measure CD44 and CD24 expression of cells derived from monoculture mammosphere cells and cocultured mammosphere cells. The expression of CD44+CD24- in monoculture mammosphere cells (left) was (17.2 \u00b1 2.3%). Compared to monoculture mammosphere cells, the expression of CD44+CD24- in cocultured mammosphere cells with CAFs (middle) was (21.4 \u00b1 1.8%), P < 0.05, and the expression of CD44+CD24- in cocultured mammosphere cells with NFs (right) was (8.7 \u00b1 0.9%), P < 0.01. The data were provided as the mean \u00b1 SD. Each experiment was performed three times.CAFs had a positive role on the tumorigenicity of mammosphere cellsTo investigate whether altered stromal niche could influence the tumorigenicity in vivo, we evaluated the tumor formation in NOD/SCID mice by inoculation of mammosphere cells with or without CAFs and NFs. The results revealed that inoculation of 1 \u00d7 105 mammosphere cells alone resulted in tumor formation in 60% of mice (3/5), and coinoculation of 1 \u00d7 105 mammosphere cells with 1 \u00d7 105 CAFs significantly improved tumor formation (5/5). Interestingly, coinoculation of 1 \u00d7 105 mammosphere cells with 1 \u00d7 105 NFs sharply decreased tumorigenicity, only 20% mice developed tumors (1/5, Table 2). These data strongly suggested that cancer stromal fibroblast significantly promote the tumorigenicity of mammosphere cells.Incidence of tumors by coinoculation of mammosphere cells with CAFs and NFs in NOD/SCID miceCells Inoculated\tMammosphere\tMammosphere + CAFs\tMammosphere + NFs\t \tTumors\t3/5\t5/5*\t1/5*\t \t*P < 0.01 compared with the same inoculation number of mammosphere cells alone.The cocultured medium of primary mammosphere cells with CAFs had higher SDF-1 expressionThe marked effects of cancer stromal niche promote us to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CAFs increased the tumorigenicity of mammosphere cells. Recent reports have indicated that SDF-1 boosts the proliferation of several cancer cell lines in culture, including breast carcinoma cells. In order to determine whether SDF-1 involved in the proliferation of CD44+CD24- cells, the production of SDF-1 in mammosphere cultures subject to various treatments were measured by ELISA. The result indicated elevated levels of SDF-1 protein in the medium conditioned by the CAFs as compared with that by mammosphere cells alone (426.4 \u00b1 30.6 pg/ml vs. 283.6 \u00b1 35.1 pg/ml, P < 0.05). In addition, the cocultured medium of mammosphere cells with NFs significantly decreased the production of SDF-1 (52.9. \u00b1 13.1 pg/ml vs. 283.6 \u00b1 35.1 pg/ml, P <0.01) (Fig. 4). These results exhibited the similar trend as MFE, generation of CD44+CD24- cells and tumorigenicity of mammosphere cells by CAFs, implying that the elevated production of SDF-1 by CAFs may be the reason for the promoted MFE, generation of CD44+CD24- cells and tumorigenicity of mammosphere cells.The SDF-1 protein expression in cocultured medium of mammosphere cells with CAFs and NFs. The SDF-1 protein level in the medium conditioned by the CAFs was (426.4 \u00b1 30.6) (pg/ml) (middle), compared to the levels produced by mammosphere cells alone (283.6 \u00b1 35.1) (pg/ml) (left), P <0.05. The cocultured medium of mammosphere cells with NFs (right) showed a far lower level of SDF-1(52.9. \u00b1 13.1) (pg/ml) secretion when compared with mammosphere cells alone, P <0.01. The SDF-1 level was measured three times in each experiment.CXCR4 antagonist reduced the generation of CD44+CD24- cellsIn order to further prove whether enhanced generation of CD44+CD24- cells by CAFs is mediated by SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4, we detected CXCR4 expression in mammosphere cells and monolayer cells by qRT-PCR. The results showed that CXCR4 mRNA expression was higher in mammosphere cells than that in monolayer cells, (P < 0.01, Fig. 5), and CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 could decrease CXCR4 gene expression in both cells. Moreover, AMD3100 significantly reduced MFE and mammosphere cell number in monoculture mammospheres and cocultured mammospheres with CAFs and NFs (Table 3), and decreased the proportion of CD44+CD24- cells (Fig. 6, and see Additional file 2). These results collectively demonstrated that CAFs enhanced generation of CD44+CD24- cells in mammospheres may be caused by SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling.Mammosphere cells and monolayer cells were cultured in the presence of 1 \u03bcg/ml AMD3100 for 48 h. qRT-PCR showed that CXCR4 mRNA expression in mammosphere cells was 3.9 fold higher than that in monolayer cells, (P <0.01), and AMD3100 could significantly down-regulate it in both when treated for 48 h.AMD3100 significantly inhibited MFE and cell number when cocultured with different stromal fibroblastsCulture Condition\tMFE (%)\tCell Number (\u00d7 105)\t \tMonoculture\t1.6 \u00b1 0.1\t0.22 \u00b1 0.07\t \tMammosphere + CAFs\t2.3 \u00b1 0.2\t0.43 \u00b1 0.14\t \tMammosphere + NFs\t1.5 \u00b1 0.2\t0.28 \u00b1 0.08\t \t*P < 0.01 compared with no treatment of AMD3100.Mammosphere cells were cocultured with different stromal fibroblasts with the administration of AMD3100 and flow cytometry was used to measure CD44 and CD24 expression. (A) Mammosphere cells were cocultured with different stromal fibroblasts with the administration of AMD3100 (1 \u03bcg/ml) for six days. As a result, MFE in monoculture mammosphere cells (left), cocultured mammosphere cells with CAFs (middle) and NFs (right) was significantly reduced to (1.6 \u00b1 0.1%), (2.3 \u00b1 0.2%) and (1.5 \u00b1 0.2%), respectively. (B) Flow cytometry analysis was used to measure CD44 and CD24 expression of cells derived from mammosphere cells. The expression of CD44+CD24- in monoculture mammosphere cells (left), cocultured mammosphere cells with stromal CAFs (middle) and NFs (right) was (2.2 \u00b1 0.3%), (4.4 \u00b1 0.8%) and (2.7 \u00b1 0.3%), respectively. The data were provided as the mean \u00b1 SD. Each experiment was performed three times.DiscussionMammosphere culture system is now widely used for stem cell culture. Dontu and his colleagues had developed an in vitro cultivation system that allowed for the proliferation of undifferentiated human mammary epithelial cells in suspension. When cultured on nonadherent surfaces in the presence of growth factors, nonadherent mammospheres were enriched in cells with functional characteristics of stem/progenitor cells. Another study also showed that breast tumorigenic cells with self-renewal could be propagated in vitro as nonadherent mammospheres. Consistent with the above reports, our study shows that mammosphere cells could be cultured in suspension and generate BCSCs with the CD44+CD24- phenotype. Thus, long-term cultures of mammosphere in vitro may represent a suitable model to study BCSCs.Stem cell properties in normal and malignant tissues are tightly regulated by the Wnt, Shh and Notch signaling pathways. Notch signaling has been implicated in the regulation of cell-fate decisions such as self-renewal of adult stem cells and differentiation of progenitor cells along a particular lineage. Dontu and his colleagues demonstrated that Notch activation promoted mammary stem cell self-renewal, but modulation of this pathway had no significant effect on differentiated mammary epithelial cells. In breast cancers, it was found that BCSCs preferentially expressed some \"stemness\" genes, including Notch1 and \u03b2-catenin . Our qRT-PCR analysis obtained the similar result that Notch2 and \u03b2-catenin were expressed at higher levels in mammosphere cells than in monolayer cells, suggesting that Notch2 and \u03b2-catenin are involved in BCSC regulation.Recent studies have indicated that tumor niches play an important role in regulating the growth and metastasis of primary tumors. For example, in cocultured experiments, CAFs extracted from human breast carcinomas were more competent in promoting the growth of admixed breast carcinoma cells than NFs that derived from the same patients. Similarly, when exposed to the conditioned medium of pancreatic stellate cells isolated from resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic epithelial cells showed an increase in proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation in soft agar in a dose-dependent manner.It is well known that expression of \u03b1-SMA is a defining characteristic of myofibroblasts, which activates the growth of fibroblasts in areas of inflammation during wound healing. Our results demonstrated that human mammary carcinomas, from which we had extracted CAFs, carried large numbers of myofibroblasts in their stroma. In this study, we found that CAFs up-regulated the proportion of CD44+CD24- cells in mammospheres, whereas NFs down-regulated it in mammospheres, implying that the CAFs have positive effects on CD44+CD24- cell generation, while NFs have negative effects on it. Furthermore, coinoculation of mammosphere cells with CAFs into NOD/SCID mice significantly increased tumorigenicity as compared to those obtained with mammosphere cells alone or with NFs. This might be attributed to the enhanced generation of mammosphere CD44+CD24- cells by CAFs.Importantly, endogenous CXCR4 expression on carcinoma cells is known to correlate with a poor prognosis for several types of carcinomas. The knockdown of CXCR4 expression by a small interfering RNA in breast carcinoma cells decreases cell invasion and proliferation in vitro and abrogates the tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, the selective blocking of the CXCR4 by plerixafor overcome the protective effect of the bone marrow environment for BCR-ABL(+) leukemia. Consistent with the above findings, our results suggested that CXCR4 gene is expressed in mammosphere cells at higher levels than that in monolayer cells. So we hypothesized that CAFs enhanced the proliferation of CD44+CD24- cells in secondary mammosphere cells through CXCR4.Essential SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions have been increasingly demonstrated in various tissues and culture systems and it is possible that SDF-1/CXCR4 initiated different signal pathways for cell proliferation and migration. In malignant tumors, SDF-1/CXCR4 may provide paracrine signals in promoting malignant progression such as metastasis, invasion and cell proliferation. We found in this study that SDF-1 was highly released in the conditioned medium of mammosphere cells with CAFs, compared with NFs. In addition, the interaction of SDF-1 released from CAFs and CRCX4 expressed on mammosphere cells is at least partly involved in the proliferation of mammosphere. Thus, it is likely that SDF-1 secreted by stromal myofibroblasts significantly affects CXCR4-expressing mammosphere cells through direct paracrine stimulation. This was further proved by CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, which significantly reduced MFE and the expression of BCSC markers in secondary mammosphere cells.Collectively, these data indicated that the specific interactions of SDF-1 with their receptor CXCR4 that expressed on mammosphere cells are likely to occur in tumor-stromal niches, and these interactions may be responsible for the proliferation of CD44+CD24- cells. The proliferation of mammosphere cells was observed to be promoted by being cocultured with CAFs, suggesting that SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling is involved in the cell proliferation of these cocultured mammosphere cells. CXCR4 and SDF-1 are candidate factors that involved in the cross-talk of the tumor-niche interaction of CD44+CD24- cells. Because the increase in the proliferation of cocultured mammosphere cells induced by SDF-1 was completely inhibited by AMD3100, therapeutic strategies that target SDF-1/CXCR4 may be beneficial to breast cancer patients. So, new strategies need to take into account the role of the niches that can have a critical role in modulating BCSCs and response to therapeutic agents. It should be noted that this study had only examined the interaction of stromal fibroblasts and CD44+CD24- cells in two dimensions, and how they interact with each other in three-dimensional culture remains to be further studied.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMZH conceived of the study, carried out the experimental studies, and drafted the manuscript.

        "content": "Accumulating evidence suggests that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Aromatase inhibitors inhibit the growth of breast tumors by inhibiting the synthesis of estrogen. However, it remains unknown whether the aromatase inhibitor letrozole has an additional impact on CAFs, which further influence the efficacy of endocrine therapy. Primary CAFs were isolated from primary estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumors. Estrogen-deprived culture medium was used to exclude the influence of steroids. In co-culture, primary cultured CAFs increased MCF7 cell adhesion, invasion, migration and proliferation, and letrozole treatment inhibited these increases, except for the increase in proliferation. In total, 258 up-regulated genes and 47 down-regulated genes with an absolute fold change &gt;2 were identified in CAFs co-cultured with MCF7 cell after letrozole treatment. One up-regulated genes (POSTN) and seven down-regulated genes (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, IL-8, CXCL5, LEP and NGF) were further validated by real-time PCR. The changes in CCL2 and CXCL1 expression were further confirmed using an automated microscopic imaging-based, high content analysis platform. Although the results need further functional validation, this study is the first to describe the differential tumor-promoting phenotype of CAFs induced by letrozole and the associated gene expression alterations. Most importantly, our data revealed that down-regulation of several secreted factors (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1 etc.) in CAFs might be partially responsible for the efficacy of letrozole. ",

        "title": "Genetic manipulation of stromal cell-derived factor-1 attests the pivotal role of the autocrine SDF-1-CXCR4 pathway in the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells.",
        "content": "Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), via its receptor CXCR4, has been implicated in metastasis of cancer, including breast cancer. Exogenous SDF-1 is known to regulate locomotion, chemotaxis and adhesion. The knowledge regarding the effect of autocrine SDF-1 on breast cancer cells is not available. The current study evaluated the effects of SDF-1 on the biological behaviour of breast cancer cells by genetically modifying the expression of SDF-1 in breast cancer cells. Two human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435s) and a human fetal lung fibroblast cell line (MRC5) were used. The expression of SDF-1 and the SDF-1 receptor, CXCR4 in the cell lines were studied. Expression cassettes of human SDF-1 and hammerhead ribozyme transgenes specifically targeting human SDF-1 were constructed and used to over-express SDF-1 or to knockout the expression of SDF-1 in cancer cells, respectively. Invasiveness, migration and growth of the genetically modified cells were assessed. SDF-1 was expressed in wild-type human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435s and fibroblast cell line MRC5, but not in MDA-MB-231 cell line. In contrast, CXCR4 expression was observed in all three cell lines tested. The ability of invasion and migration was significantly reduced in SDF-1 knockout MDA-MB-435s cells, compared with wild-type and vector control cells (p&lt;0.01). On the other hand, SDF-1 transfected MDA-MB-231epsilonSDF1+/+ cells that stably expressed SDF-1 showed a different behaviour from MDA-MB-231SDF1+/- (plasmid control) and wild-type MDA-MB-231 cells, both being SDF-1 negative. MDA-MB-231epsilonSDF1+/+ cells displayed a higher degree of invasiveness and migration, compared with wild-type and MDA-MB-231SDF+/- cells (p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, SDF1-knockout MDA-MB-435s cells showed a slower growth rate over a 7-day period compared with the respective control and wild-type MDA-MB-435s cells. In contrast, the growth of the SDF-1 transfected MDA-MB-231SDF1+/+ cells was markedly enhanced when compared with wild-type and vector control cells. Breast cancer cell lines, when equipped with the autocrine SDF-1-CXCR4 signal pathway, display aggressive behaviour, including an increase in invasiveness, migration together with faster growth. SDF-1, together with its receptor CXCR4 may provide important information for predicting the aggressive nature and constitute important therapeutic targets in human breast cancer.",

Beside traditionally considered as an insulating and mechanically supportive site of energy storage, adipose tissue has endocrine functions, capable of regulating systemic energy and metabolic homeostasis through a complex network of signals. The concept that adipose tissue, and more specifically adipocytes, are involved in tumor initiation, growth, and metastasis, is now called \u201cadiponcosis\u201d.Adipocytes surround breast cancer cells and may contribute to the stromal\u2013ductal epithelial cell\u2013cell interactions within the mammary microenvironment. In this regard, obesity has been shown to increase rates of breast cancer in postmenopausal women by 30\u201350%. Studies of mortality and survival illustrate that adiposity is associated with both poorer survival and increased likelihood of recurrence among breast cancer cases, regardless of menopausal status and after adjustment for stage and treatment. Death rate in very obese women (BMI \u2265 40.0) with breast cancer is three times higher than in very lean (BMI < 20.5) women.Moreover, epidemiological studies have also revealed that women with diabetes have a statistically significant 20% increased risk of breast cancer. Additionally, patients with breast cancer and preexisting diabetes have increased risk for distant metastasis and for all-cause mortality compared with their non-diabetic counterparts.Metabolic derangements, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, drive to adipocyte alterations with imbalanced production of adipokines, proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, hormones, proangiogenic factors and extracellular matrix constituents. Virtually, all of the adipocyte factors may be envisioned as contributing factors for cancer onset and/or progression. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that adipocytes could promote breast tumor growth. Moreover, glucose and fatty acids modify adipocyte-releasing properties and enhance their ability to induce breast cancer cell proliferation. Nevertheless, how metabolic alterations at the level of the adipose tissue may affect tumor progression is still unclear.Here, we show that adipocytes may integrate inputs from metabolic environment and promote motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. This effect is induced, at least in part, by the CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), also known as RANTES (Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed and Secreted), whose abundance in peritumoral adipose tissue correlates with metastasis and with poorer overall survival in women with Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC).RESULTSAdipocytes promote TNBC cell motilityIn order to investigate adipocyte effect on cancer cell invasiveness, MDA-MB231 triple negative breast cancer cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell, while differentiated human adipocytes were seeded in the lower chamber. Co-culture with adipocytes, in the absence of serum, increased MDA-MB231 invasive capacity through the matrigel filter by 1.7-fold compared to the same cells cultured in the absence of adipocytes (Figure 1A). At variance, co-culture with human Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells enhanced by only 1.2-fold MDA-MB231 invasion. The effect of adipocyte factors was similar to the positive control (i.e. cells incubated with 10% FBS medium).Effect of adipocytes and glucose-treated adipocytes on breast cancer cell motility(A) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with or without human SVF/adipocytes in the lower chamber in serum free-medium. Cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining as described in Materials and Methods. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells without SVF/adipocytes in the lower chamber, incubated in serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values (**p < 0.01). (B) Human adipocytes were shifted with high glucose medium (25 mM glucose-HG) or with low glucose medium (5.5 mM glucose-LG) for 24 h. Then, they were incubated with MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells incubated in serum-free HG or LG medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (**p < 0.01). #denote statistically significant values of HG over LG (#p < 0.05). (C) Human adipocytes were pre-incubated with HG medium or with LG medium for 24 h. Then, they were further incubated with regular glucose (15 mM) serum-free medium for 8 h. Media were collected (CM) and applied in the lower chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells incubated in regular glucose serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (*p < 0.05). #denote statistically significant values of CM-HG over CM-LG (#p < 0.05). (D) Confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded by manually scratching as described in Materials and Methods and incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes pre-incubated with either LG or HG medium for 24 h and further incubated with regular glucose serum-free medium for 8 h. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by a digital camera coupled to the microscope and percentage of wound distance was calculated with the camera software. The results have been reported as percentage of gap closure at 24 h compared with time 0. A complete gap closure was considered as 100%. *denote statistically significant values over MDA-MB231 cells incubated in regular glucose serum-free medium (*p < 0.05). #denote statistically significant values of CM-HG over CM-LG (#p < 0.05). The pictures are representative of wound gaps at 0 point and upon 24 h of scratch assay. For all the panels in the figure, data in the graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent triplicate experiments.Next, we tested whether glucose may change the promoting action of human adipocytes on MDA-MB231 invasiveness. To this end, human differentiated adipocytes, regularly cultured in 15 mM glucose, were shifted for 24 h in either 25 mM glucose (HG), a concentration resembling hyperglycemia in humans, or in 5.5 mM glucose (LG), a concentration representative of normal fasting glucose levels in humans. Then, adipocytes were co-cultured with MDA-MB231 in serum-free HG or LG medium for additional 24 h. As shown in Figure 1B adipocytes significantly increased cancer cell invasiveness and this effect is potentiated in HG (3-fold increase compared to LG). Similar results were obtained also with conditioned media (CM) system. In detail, adipocytes were cultured for 24 h either in HG and in LG. Media were changed and cells were allowed to secrete factors into freshly added serum free medium (15 mM glucose). After 8 h, CM were collected and applied into the lower chamber of a transwell system in presence of MDA-MB231 cells seeded in the upper chamber on a matrigel-coated filter. As shown, pre-incubation of adipocytes with HG medium enhanced by about 2-fold their ability to induce MDA-MB231 cell invasiveness, compared to control cells (without CM) (Figure 1C). At variance, pre-incubation with LG medium significantly lowered their ability to promote invasiveness of breast cancer cells (Figure 1C).In order to test cell motility, confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded longitudinally and incubated with conditioned media derived from adipocytes incubated with HG (HG-CM) or LG (LG-CM) in presence of mitomycin C, an irreversible inhibitor of mitosis. Images were taken at 0 and 24 h after wounding. HG-CM increased motility of breast cancer cells by about 2-fold (Figure 1D). The wound closure was similar to that achieved with 10% FBS medium and significantly higher compared to that observed with LG-CM. Similar results were also obtained with ER-\u03b1 positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 1).Adipocyte-released CCL5 promotes motility and invasion of breast cancer cellsWe have previously shown that glucose increases the release of CCL5 and IGF-1 by adipocytes. Now, we provide evidences that glucose did not directly interfere with their secretion by cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 2A\u20132B). In order to address the biological relevance of CCL5 and IGF-1 as adipocyte-derived motility promoting factors, MDA-MB231 were co-cultured with human adipocytes in presence of specific inhibitors of CCL5 action: a monoclonal antibody raised against CCL5 (CCL5-Ab) or a peptide for the CCL5 receptor CCR5 (CCR5-pep). Both CCL5-Ab and CCR5-pep almost completely prevented STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 3) as well as the effect of adipocytes on MDA-MB231 invasiveness (Figure 2A). At variance, AG1024, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1 receptor, did not significantly reduce adipocyte action (Figure 2A). Similarly, CCL5 inhibition led to a significant reduction of wound closure of CM-treated MDA-MB231 (Figure 2B). Conversely, IGF-1 receptor inhibition did not interfere with adipocyte-induced cancer cell motility (Figure 2B).Effect of CCL5 and IGF-1 pathway inhibition on adipocyte-induced breast cancer cell motility(A) MDA-MB231 cells were seeded in the upper chamber of a matrigel-coated transwell culture system with or without human adipocytes in the lower chamber in serum free-medium. Co-cultured cells were incubated with 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Antibody (CCL5 Ab), 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 peptide (CCR5 pep) or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Cancer cells that migrated across the matrigel-coated filter were determined by crystal violet staining. The results have been reported as percentage of stained cells compared to control cells (MDA-MB231 cells without adipocytes in the lower chamber, incubated in serum-free medium). *denote statistically significant values over control (**p < 0.01). #denote statistically significant values over MDA-MB231-adipocytes co-culture (#p < 0.05). (B) Confluent monolayers of MDA-MB231 were wounded by manually scratching and incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes for 24 h in presence of 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Ab, 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 pep or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by a digital camera coupled to the microscope and percentage of wound distance was calculated with the camera software. The results have been reported as percentage of gap closure at 24 h compared with time 0. A complete gap closure was considered as 100%. *denote statistically significant values over control (***p < 0.001). #denote statistically significant values over Adipo-CM treated cells (#p < 0.05). The pictures are representative of wound gaps at 0 point and upon 24 h of scratch assay. Data in the graphs represent the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three independent triplicate experiments.Next, we addressed whether adipocytes may control CCL5 and IGF-1 production by cancer cells. To this aim, we have measured CCL5 and IGF-1 mRNA levels in MDA-MB231 cells following adipocyte CM exposure. Adipocyte CM did not induce any significant increase of CCL5 mRNA levels in MDA-MB231 cells, while inducing IGF-1 expression (Figure 3). The presence of CCL5-Ab or CCR5-pep did not reduce CM-induced expression of IGF-1, suggesting that adipocyte-released factors different from CCL5 may control IGF-1 production by cancer cells. Moreover, AG1024 treatment did not modify CCL5 expression in MDA-MB231 cells thus indicating that IGF-1 did not control CCL5 in cancer cells (Figure 3).Cross-regulation of CCL5 and IGF-1 in cancer cellsMDA-MB231 were incubated with CM collected from human adipocytes for 24 h in presence or absence of 6 \u03bcg/ml CCL5 Ab, 5 \u03bcg/ml CCR5 pep or 10 \u03bcM AG1024. Next, mRNA levels of human CCL5 and IGF-1 were determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis as described in Materials and Methods. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 SD of four independent experiments. Bars show mRNA levels in these cells relative to those in untreated cells (cells in serum-free medium). Asterisks denote statistically significant values over untreated cells (*p < 0.05).CCL5 and IGF-1 detection in peritumoral adipose tissue of women with TNBCNext, we evaluated whether CCL5 and IGF-1 could be detected in peritumoral adipose tissue of women with breast cancer. We selected 40 invasive ductal TNBC samples. Patients\u2019 mean age was 59 years (range from 27 to 93); 12 patients (30%) were pre-menopausal and 28 (70%) post-menopausal. Tumors larger than 2 cm occurred in 52.5% (21/40) of patients. 95% (38/40) of patients had tumor with poorly differentiated cells (grade 3), while only 5% (2/40) had tumor with moderately differentiated cells (grade 2). None of the tumors was of grade 1. Metastatic lymph nodes were found in 40% (16/40) of patients at surgery and 30% (12/40) of patients developed distant metastases. The expression of the proliferation factor Ki67 was high (> 30%) in 55% (22/40), and low (\u2264 30%) in 45% (18/40) of specimens. 17.5% (7/32) of patients were diabetic and 32.5% (13/31) had a BMI greater than 30 (Table 1).Clinical and pathological features of TNBC samples\tPatients (n = 40)\t \tAge\t \tMean:59 y (range: 27\u201393)\t \t< 40\t4 (10%)\t \t\u2265 40 \u2264 60\t17 (42.5%)\t \t> 60\t19 (47.5%)\t \tGrade\t \tI\t0 (0%)\t \tII\t2 (5%)\t \tIII\t38 (95%)\t \tSize (T)\t \t\u2264 2 cm\t20 (50%)\t \t> 2 \u2264 5 cm\t17 (42.5%)\t \t> 5\t3 (3.5%)\t \tLNM\t \tYes\t16 (40%)\t \tNo\t24 (60%)\t \tMetastasis\t \tYes\t12 (30%)\t \tNo\t28 (70%)\t \tKi-67\t \t> 30\t22 (55%)\t \t\u2264 30\t18 (45%)\t \tBMI\t \tMean: 27.65 (range: 20.03\u201337.92)\t \t< 30\t18 (45%)\t \t\u2265 30\t13 (32,5%)\t \tUnknown\t9 (22.5%)\t \tDiabetes\t \tYes\t8 (20%)\t \tNo\t24 (60%)\t \tUnknown\t8 (20%)\t \tFollow up\t \tNED\t16 (40%)\t \tAWD\t10 (25%)\t \tDOD\t3 (7.5%)\t \tUnknown\t11 (27.5%)\t \tLNM = Limph node metastasis; NED = No evidence of disease; AWD = Alive with disease; DOD = Dead of disease.CCL5 and IGF-1 specific staining was detected in peritumoral adipocytes of TNBC samples (up to 1 cm distance from the tumour). CCL5 staining in peritumoral adipose tissue was detected in 16/40 samples (40%) (Figure 4). Adipose tissue IGF-1 staining was detected in 20/40 samples (50%) (Figure 5).CCL5 IHC staining in peritumoral adipocytes of TNBC samples(A\u2013B) Negative expression of CCL5 in peritumoral adipocytes of a TNBC sample at 20\u00d7 (A) and 40\u00d7 (B) magnification.

CCL5 protein staining showed a positive, although not statistically significant correlation trend with Ki67 proliferation index (P-value = 0.085). Interestingly, CCL5 staining in peritumoral adipocyte was significantly associated with lymph node (P-value = 0.05) and distant metastases (P-value = 0.001) (Table 2). A positive trend (P-value = 0.095) between CCL5 immunoreactivity and fasting glucose levels was also revealed. No significant correlation was observed for IGF-1 staining in the adipocytes of TNBC samples with age, menopausal status, BMI, diabetes, glycaemic levels, tumour histotype, size and grading, Ki67 expression, lymph node and distant metastases (Table 2). CCL5 and IGF-1 staining was detected in peritumoral adipose tissue of 25 samples of ER positive patients whose clinical and pathological features have been described in Supplementary Table 1. CCL5 was detected in 19/25 samples (76%), while IGF-1 in 22/25 samples (88%) (data not shown).

In cancer, the coordinated intercellular interactions are disrupted as the tumor acquires the capacity to chronically circumvent normalizing cues from the microenvironment, and in turn, the microenvironment evolves to accommodate the growing tumor.We have addressed whether peritumoral adipose tissue may modify cancer cell invasiveness. For this purpose, we have used Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells (which stain negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2) and human mammary adipocytes. TNBCs account for 10\u201324% of invasive breast cancers and are typically high-grade tumors with different histological types. Usually, patients with TNBC have a higher recurrence rate after diagnosis, a short disease-free interval and a reduced overall survival, mainly for the lack of targeted therapies.Adipocytes are active and important modulators of mammary tumor microenvironment. Data mainly obtained in cultured murine cell models have suggested that adipocyte factors, including a wide array of adipokines, cytokines and growth factors, promote survival, growth and motility of cancer cells.Here, we show that TNBC cells display increased motility and invasiveness when co-cultured with human adipocytes. Interestingly, raising glucose concentrations further increased the promoting action of adipocytes on cancer cell motility. As also previously reported by others, higher glucose concentrations per se may enhance breast cancer cell growth and motility, by providing fuel for the increasing energy demand. However, experiments with co-culture and conditioned media have indicated that glucose increases the release of adipocyte factors, which, even in lower glucose concentrations, are capable to enhance cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Thus, high glucose levels may facilitate cancer progression by acting either directly on cancer cells or indirectly on the surrounding adipose cells.These in vitro observations are consistent with the evidence that: i) the epidemic surge of obesity and diabetes mellitus is paralleled by increased onset and progression of oncologic disorders, including breast cancer; ii) hyperglycaemia represents an independent risk factor for cancer progression; iii) tumour microenvironment responds to metabolic imbalance and accounts for several modifications occurring in cancer phenotypes.All together these observations indicate that the adipose tissue within the tumour microenvironment may sense metabolic derangements and worsen breast cancer progression.When cultured in high glucose concentrations or with fatty acids, adipocytes release a larger amount of IGF-1 and CCL5, without changing the secretion of several other factors. We have now shown that CCL5 is needed for breast cancer cell motility and invasion promoted by adipocytes. Indeed, either blocking CCL5 with a neutralizing antibody or preventing CCL5 binding to its CCR5 receptor reduced adipocyte effect on TNBC cell motility and invasiveness. At variance, an IGF-1/Insulin pathway inhibitor had no effect on adipocyte action, suggesting that adipocyte-released IGF-1 is dispensable (notably, insulin is not released by adipocytes and is not present in culture medium).CCL5 is a chemokine that has been associated to several forms of cancer. Elevated circulating levels of CCL5 have been found both in diabetic and in obese individuals. Nevertheless, CCL5/CCR5 expression levels are different among the different genetic subtypes of breast cancer and may represent a negative prognostic factor. However, tumor-derived CCL5 apparently does not contribute to breast cancer progression. It has been shown that CCL5 induces the invasion of basal breast cancer cells (i.e. MDA-MB-231 cells) but not of luminal breast cancer cells (i.e. MCF-7 cells). In agreement, increased CCL5 circulating levels have been found predominantly in ER-negative patients.Here, we have developed an immunohistochemical method to detect CCL5 and IGF-1 in tumor-associated adipose tissue specimens. This was a relevant achievement since very few markers have been analyzed in adipose cells through in-situ techniques. We were also able to establish an adequate evaluation score. Interestingly, in TNBCs, CCL5, while not IGF-1, immunodetection is significantly associated with lymph node and distant metastases. Consistently, a negative association of CCL5 staining in TNBC-associated adipose tissue with overall survival is suggestive of a more aggressive cancer behavior. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of a potential prognostic marker in peri-tumoral adipose tissue. Further work is needed to analyze the association between CCL5 and IGF-1 staining in adipose tissue and cancer features of patient with ER positive cancer.Most likely, CCL5 is largely produced by adipocytes. Indeed, no induction of CCL5 gene expression by adipocyte factors has been detected in breast cancer cells. Since CCL5 could act locally promoting cell movement, it could be involved in cancer invasion of the surrounding adipose tissue, which is one of the biologic indicators of tumor aggressiveness.CCL5 binds to its cognate receptor CCR5 and activates Jak kinases, STAT3, mTOR and p38 MAP kinase regulating the engagement of multiple signaling pathways. It mediates the trafficking and homing of classical lymphoid cells such as T cells and monocytes, but also acts on a range of other cells, including basophils, eosinophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and mast cells. Upon recruitment of immune cells, inflamed adipose tissue may further promote growth of malignant cells by inducing vascular endothelium and activating proinflammatory cells.Recently, genomic profiling studies have identified specific subtypes for TNBC with differential aggressiveness potential. These studies have evidenced that the Basal-Like Immune Activated subtype, which display up-regulation of genes controlling B cell, T cell, natural killer cell functions and inflammatory cytokines, was among the most aggressive molecular subtypes. Therefore, it is plausible that excess adiposity, as well as high blood glucose levels, may contribute to the production of inflammation/immunity-related factors, which may worsen cancer prognosis in metabolically deranged individuals. It should be pointed out that, although not reaching statistical significance, higher glycaemic levels are also associated with CCL5 detection in TNBC specimens. Further studies are needed to analyse CCL5 levels in serum of TNBC patients.Thus, we described that CCL5 release by adipocytes contributes to increase motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells. CCL5 is detectable in peritumoral adipose tissue of TNBCs and correlates with lymph node and distant metastases and with the reduction of patient overall survival. This is a relevant issue since, so far, no effective molecular targeted drug is available for TNBC. In this regard, CCR5 antagonists are widely used for the treatment of HIV infection. Moreover, in animal models, CCL5 knockout does not affect general physiology and broad immunity, suggesting that specific targeted inhibition may have strong therapeutic impact without over-toxicity.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsMedia, sera, and antibiotics for cell culture were from Lonza (Lonza Group Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). Anti-CCL5 and IGF1 antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-Er\u03b1, PR, c-Erb B2 and Ki67 antibodies were purchased from DAKO (Ely, UK). All the other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).Peptide synthesisThe synthesis of peptide CCR5-pep (sequence: AFDWTFVPSLIL-NH2) was performed according to the solid-phase approach using standard Fmoc methodology in a manual reaction vessel. N\u03b1-Fmoc-protected amino acids, Rinkamide-resin, N-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt), 2-(1Hbenzotriazole-1-yl)21,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), N, N-diisopropylethyl-amine (DIPEA), piperidine and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Iris Biotech (Germany). Peptide synthesis solvents, reagents, as well as CH3CN for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were reagent grade and were acquired from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The first amino acid, N\u03b1Fmoc-Leu-OH was linked on to the Rink resin (100\u2013200 mesh, 1% divinylbenzene, 0.75 mmol/g) previously deprotected by a 25% piperidine solution in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for 30 min.The following protected amino acids were then added stepwise: N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ile-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Leu-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ser(tBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Pro-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Val-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Phe-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Thr(tBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Trp(Boc)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Asp(OtBU)-OH, N\u03b1-Fmoc-Ala-OH,. Each coupling reaction was accomplished using a threefold excess of amino acid with HBTU and HOBt in the presence of DIPEA (6 eq.). The Na-Fmoc protecting groups were removed by treating the protected peptide resin with a 25% solution of piperidine in DMF (1 \u00d7 5 min and 1 \u00d7 25 min).The peptide resin was washed three times with DMF, and the next coupling step was initiated in a stepwise manner. The peptide resin was washed with dichloromethane (DCM) (3\u00d7), DMF (3\u00d7), and DCM (3\u00d7), and the deprotection protocol was repeated after each coupling step. In addition, after each step of deprotection and after each coupling step, Kaiser test was performed to confirm the complete removal of the Fmoc protecting group, respectively, and to verify that complete coupling has occurred on all the free amines on the resin.The N-terminal Fmoc group was removed as described above, and the peptide was released from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane(iPr3SiH)/H2O (90:5:5) for 3 h. The resin was removed by filtration, and the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with cold anhydrous ethyl ether to give a white powder and then lyophilized.Purification and characterizationAll crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a semipreparative C18-bonded silica column (Phenomenex, Jupiter, 250 mm 3 10 mm) using a Shimadzu SPD 10A UV/VIS detector, with detection at 210 and 254 nm.The column was perfused at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 40 min with solvent A (10%, vol/vol, water in 0.1% aqueous TFA), and a linear gradient from 10 to 90% of solvent B (80%, vol/vol, acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous TFA). Analytical purity and retention time (tR) of each peptide were determined using HPLC conditions in the above solvent system (solvents A and B) programmed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient from 10 to 90% B over 25 min, fitted with C-18 column Phenomenex, Juppiter C-18 column (250 mm 3 4.60 mm; 5 mm).All analogues showed > 97% purity when monitored at 215 nm. Homogeneous fractions, as established using analytical HPLC, were pooled and lyophilized.Peptides molecular weights were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). ESI-MS analysis in positive ion mode were made using a Finnigan liquid chromatography quadrupole mass spectrometry (LCQ) ion trap instrument, manufactured by Thermo Finnigan (San Jose, CA), equipped with the Excalibur software for processing the data acquired. The sample was dissolved in a mixture of water and methanol (50/50) and injected directly into the electrospray source, using a syringe pump, which maintains constant flow at 5 ml/min. The temperature of the capillary was set at 220\u00b0C.Cell culturesMDA-MB-231 (ER\u03b1, PgR and HER2 negative) and MCF-7 (ER\u03b1, PgR positive and HER2 negative) human breast cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 IU/ml streptomycin. Cultures were kept in humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 C. Human adipose tissue samples were obtained from mammary adipose tissue biopsies of healthy women (n = 12; age 25\u201363 years; BMI 24.2\u201329.0) undergoing surgical mammary reduction. All women were otherwise healthy and free of metabolic or endocrine diseases. Informed consent was obtained from every subject before the surgical procedure. The ethical committee of the University of Naples approved this procedure. Adipose tissue was digested with collagenase and Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction cells (SVF) were isolated and differentiated as previously reported. Conditioned media (CM) were obtained by incubating the cells for 8 h with serum-free DMEM 0.25% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) after two washes with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). After the incubation, medium was collected and centrifuged at 14000 g to remove cellular debris and placed onto recipient cells.Co-culture and invasion assayCell invasiveness was examined using a reconstituted extracellular matrix (1.5 mg/ml Matrigel; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) coated on polycarbonate membranes of the upper compartment of a 24 well transwell system (8 \u03bcm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA). 24 h serum-starved MDA-MB231 cells (1 \u00d7 103 cells/well) were seeded on the matrigel-coated membrane and co-cultivated with either differentiated adipocytes or with undifferentiated SVF cells in the bottom chamber in serum-free medium. Alternatively, adipocyte CM was placed in the bottom of the transwell. Then, cells were allowed to invade the matrix and migrate into the lower chamber at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere saturated with H2O for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the upper surface of the membrane was swiped to remove the attached cells. The cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filter were fixed with 11% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet-20% methanol for 20 min at room temperature. After three PBS washes and complete drying at room temperature, the crystal violet was solubilized by immersing the filters in 10% acetic acid. The concentration of the solubilized crystal violet was evaluated as absorbance at 540 nm.Scratch assayScratch assay was performed as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB231 cells were starved in serum-free DMEM-F12 0.25% BSA for 16 h. Confluent monolayers were wounded by manually scratching with a p20 pipette tip. They were next washed twice with PBS and incubated at 37 C with mitomycin C (10 mg/ml; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and adipocyte CM. Images of wound gap were taken at 0 and 24 h by the Olympus DP20 microscope digital camera system (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and percentage of closure was calculated with a dedicated software.Real-time RT-PCR analysisTotal RNA was isolated from MDA-MB231 cells by using the Rneasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. 1 \u03bcg RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed with SYBR Green mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using an iCycler IQ multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All reactions were performed in triplicate and \u03b2-actin was used as an internal standard.

These patients were different from those ones enrolled for adipose tissue biopsies. As for Institutional statistics, TNBCs represent 15\u201319% of the total number of breast cancer surgical samples. All cases of TNBC samples were reviewed according to WHO classification criteria, using standard tissue sections and appropriate immunohistochemical slides. Medical records for all cases of TNBC samples were reviewed for clinical information, including histologic parameters that were determined from the H and E slides. The following clinical and pathological parameters were evaluated for each tumor included in the study: patient age at initial diagnosis, tumor size, histologic subtype, nuclear grade, nodal status, number of positive lymph nodes, tumor stage, tumor recurrence or distant metastasis and type of surgery (for tumor removal). In addition, all specimens were characterized for all routinely diagnostic immunophenotypic parameters.Immunohistochemistry analysisCCL5, IGF-1, ER\u03b1, PR, c-ErbB and KI67 staining was evaluated on slides of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin slides were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides heated in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a bath for 20 minutes at 97 C. After antigen retrieval, the slides were allowed to cool. The slides were rinsed with Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) and the endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. After protein blocking (BSA 5% PBS 1\u00d7), slides were incubated with primary antibody to human CCL5 (dilution 1:100) and IGF-1 (dilution 1:500) over night and to human ER\u03b1 (dilution 1:35), PR (dilution 1:50), c-Erb B2 (dilution 1:300) and Ki67 (dilution 1:75) for 30 min. The sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 20 min with Biotinylated Secondary Antibody (RE7103, Novocastra, Nussloch, Germany). Then, sections were rinsed in TBS and incubated for 20 min with Streptavidin-HRP (RE7104, Novocastra, Nussloch, Germany). Peroxidase reactivity was visualized using a 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted.Immunohistochemistry evaluationTwo trained pathologists using a light microscopy evaluated antigen immunoreactivity independently. Observer was unaware of the clinical outcome. For each sample, at least five High Power Fields (HPF) (inside the tumor and in the area exhibiting tumor invasion) and > 500 cells were analysed. Using a microscopically semi-quantitative scoring system and referring to each antigen scoring method in other studies, we evaluated the intensity, extent and subcellular distribution of CCL5 and IGF-1.The proliferative index Ki67 was defined as the percentage of immunoreactive tumour cells out of the total number of cells. The percentage of positive cells per case was scored according to 2 different groups: group 1: < 30% (low proliferative activity); group 2: > 30% (high proliferative activity).There were no standardized criteria for CCL5 and IGF-1 adipose staining evaluation. We evaluated CCL5 and IGF1 protein reactivity in peritumoral adipocytes (until one centimeter from the tumor), considering only the positive or negative staining. CCL5 and IGF-1 detection in lymphocytes and macrophages was considered as internal positive control.Other routinely used diagnostic markers (ER\u03b1, PR and c-Erb B2) were evaluated as previously described.Statistical analysisThe Pearson \u03c72 test was used to analyze the association between CCL5 and IGF-1 staining in peritumoral adipocytes and clinical pathological features included in the study. The level of significance was defined as P < 0.05. Overall survival (OS) curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the significance was evaluated using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis (first biopsy) to death by any cause or until the most recent follow-up. The follow-up duration was five years. All the statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Science v. 20 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND TABLECONFLICTS OF INTERESTAll authors have no conflicts of interest.FINANCIAL SUPPORTAssociazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC n.

        "content": "Bone is a common site of metastasis for various types of cancer cells, including breast cancer, and the consequent skeleton-related events observed in patients are severe and often fatal. Currently, it is widely accepted that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) confer a metastasis-promoting property to breast cancer cells. Furthermore, clinical observations suggest that CAFs mediate the bone tropism of metastatic breast cancer cells. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the mechanism by which CAFs are involved in the bone-tropic metastasis of breast cancer can facilitate the study of the novel and effective therapeutic drugs for the corresponding targets. In this review, we focused on the coordinator role of CAFs in remolding breast cancer cells and remodeling the bone marrow during metastasis. We discussed the potential roles of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, the CAFs-CSCs reinforcing loop, and exosomes in this malignant process. In summary, in agreement with Paget's theory, CAFs play a pivotal role in bone colonization by breast cancer cells by providing a \"fertile soil\" for the \"selected seeds\" by influencing tumor-intrinsic characteristics and microenvironment (ME).",

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) have recently been implicated in important aspects of epithelial solid tumor biology, such as neoplastic progression, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, neither the source of CAFs nor the differences between CAFs and fibroblasts from nonneoplastic tissue have been well defined. In this study, we show that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exposed to tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) over a prolonged period of time assume a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype. More importantly, these cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including sustained expression of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and the ability to promote tumor cell growth both in vitro and in an in vivo coimplantation model, and expression of myofibroblast markers, including alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast surface protein. hMSCs induced to differentiate to a myofibroblast-like phenotype using 5-azacytidine do not promote tumor cell growth as efficiently as hMSCs cultured in TCM nor do they show increased SDF-1 expression. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed similarities between TCM-exposed hMSCs and CAFs. Taken together, these data suggest that hMSCs are a source of CAFs and can be used in the modeling of tumor-stroma interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that hMSCs become activated and resemble carcinoma-associated myofibroblasts on prolonged exposure to conditioned medium from MDAMB231 human breast cancer cells.",

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",
