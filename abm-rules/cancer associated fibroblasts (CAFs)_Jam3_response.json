    "## Potential Rules for Jam3 in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Jam3 increases migration speed. **Justification:** While the documents provided don't directly mention Jam3's effect on CAF migration, they highlight the importance of other JAM family members in cell migration. For example, document [41] states that JAM-A regulates FGF-2-induced angiogenesis by augmenting endothelial cell migration. Document [42] further demonstrates that JAM-A regulates breast cancer cell migration via activation of Rap1 GTPase and \u03b21-integrin. Given the close relationship between JAM family members, it's plausible that Jam3 could also influence CAF migration speed. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Jam3 decreases transform to activated. **Justification:** Document [1] mentions that CAFs are a major source of collagen 1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. Document [11] identifies EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1) as a potential target of miR-9, which is released by TNBC cells to enhance the transition of normal fibroblasts into CAF-like cells. Document [31] suggests that CAFs can reprogram blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. These documents highlight the role of CAFs in promoting tumor growth and invasion. It's possible that Jam3, by influencing cell-cell adhesion and communication, could suppress the activation of CAFs, potentially leading to a less aggressive tumor microenvironment. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Jam3 decreases secretion of CXCL12. **Justification:** Document [3] describes how CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a multi-step mechanism involving the secretion of CXCL12. Document [22] highlights the role of CXCL12 in promoting tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. It's possible that Jam3, by influencing cell-cell interactions and communication, could suppress the secretion of CXCL12 by CAFs, potentially reducing the immunosuppressive effects of these cells and promoting a more effective anti-tumor immune response. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Jam3 increases transform to M1. **Justification:** Document [4] suggests that CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating the protumoral phenotype of TAMs. Document [31] identifies a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). It's possible that Jam3, by influencing cell-cell interactions and communication, could promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M1 phenotype, which is associated with the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors that can promote tumor cell killing. **Note:** These rules are based on the available information and require further investigation and validation. The specific effects of Jam3 on CAFs and the tumor microenvironment need to be explored through experimental studies. "
