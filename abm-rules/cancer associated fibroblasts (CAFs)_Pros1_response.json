    "## Potential Rules for Pros1 in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Pros1 increases migration speed. **Justification:** Periostin (Pros1) is a matricellular protein that promotes cancer cell migration, proliferation, and invasion. [Document 0, Document 18] It has been shown to be upregulated in the premetastatic niche and to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the extracellular matrix. [Document 18] This suggests that Pros1 may also play a role in promoting CAF migration, which could contribute to the spread of cancer cells. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Pros1 increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Periostin (Pros1) is a matricellular protein that promotes the activation of fibroblasts. [Document 18] It has been shown to be upregulated in the premetastatic niche and to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the extracellular matrix. [Document 18] This suggests that Pros1 may also play a role in promoting the activation of CAFs, which could contribute to the spread of cancer cells. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Pros1 increases collagen secretion. **Justification:** Periostin (Pros1) is a matricellular protein that promotes the incorporation of tenascin-c into the extracellular matrix. [Document 18] Tenascin-c is a component of the extracellular matrix that can promote tumor growth and metastasis. [Document 18] This suggests that Pros1 may also play a role in promoting collagen secretion by CAFs, which could contribute to the spread of cancer cells. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Pros1 increases transform to M2 from 0 towards 0.05 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 10. **Justification:** Periostin (Pros1) has been shown to promote the polarization of macrophages towards the M2 phenotype. [Document 18] M2 macrophages are known to suppress the immune response and promote tumor growth. [Document 18] This suggests that Pros1 may also play a role in promoting the transformation of CAFs towards an M2-like phenotype, which could contribute to the spread of cancer cells. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific model and the available data. "
