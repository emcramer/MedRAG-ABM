Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. ***p \u2264 0.001 using \u0394Ct valuesTo evaluate the effect of COX-2 expression on structural ECM changes, we characterized Col1 fiber distribution in 1 mm-thick fresh tumor slices using second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors. Clone 13 tumors with COX-2 downregulated contained fewer Col1 fibers with significantly increased mean inter-fiber distance (Figure 3B, left) and reduced fractional fiber volume (Figure 3B, right).A. 3D visualization of Col1 fibers in COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 and COX-2 reduced Clone 13 tumors.

Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained lung sections, shown in Figure 4A, demonstrate the reduction in colonization and establishment of pulmonary metastasis following COX-2 downregulation.

Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100.

D. Quantification of Col1 fiber volume and fiber distribution in lung nodules. Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Spearman correlation between sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse. A significant correlation was observed supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.To further establish the role of COX-2 expression in modulating the ECM, we stably overexpressed the coding sequence of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cells (SUM-149-COX-2FL). Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule. Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.NFsnormal fibroblastsCAFscancer-associated fibroblastsmicroRNAmiRNAECMextracellular matrixTMEtumor microenvironmentHER2human epidermal growth factor receptor 2TNBCtriple-negative breast cancerCDH1E-cadherinEFEMP1epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1SFRP4secreted frizzled-related protein 4CCL5chemokine ligand 5ATP8B2ATPase aminophospholipid transporter type 8B member 2COL1A1collagen type 1 alpha 1THBS2thrombospondin 2FBLN1fibulin 1RECKreversion inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifsCDH4retinal cadherinPMAIP1phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate induced protein 1MMP1matrix metalloproteinase-1SPRY2sprout homolog 2DUSP5dual specificity phosphatase 5HSPA5heat-shock protein 5HSPA6heat-shock protein 6STC1stanniocalcin 1\u03b1-SMAalpha-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinGAPDHglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Supplementary Information accompanies this paper on Cell Death and Disease website (http://www.nature.com/cddis)Edited by M AgostiniThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Stromal fibroblasts in cancer: a novel tumor-promoting cell typeFibroblasts in cancerReciprocal changes in gene expression profiles of cocultured breast epithelial cells and primary fibroblastsMolecular characterization of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancerMolecular signatures suggest a major role for stromal cells in development of invasive breast cancerGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancer: epidemiological considerations and recommendationsBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts: their roles in tumor initiation, progression and clinical applicationsFunctional subsets of mesenchymal cell types in the tumor microenvironmentDifferential expression of cancer-associated fibroblast-related proteins according to molecular subtype and stromal histology in breast cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "title": "Mechanism of GPER promoting proliferation, migration and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells through CAF.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

        "content": "It has been reported that stromal cell features may affect the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent one of the most abundant cell types within the breast cancer stroma. Here, we aimed to explore the influence of CAFs on breast cancer gene expression, as well as on invasion and angiogenesis. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of several cancer progression related genes (S100A4, TGF\u03b2, FGF2, FGF7, PDGFA, PDGFB, VEGFA, IL-6, IL-8, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11 and TIMP1) in the human breast cancer-derived cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, before and after co-culture with CAFs. Stromal mononuclear inflammatory cell (MIC) MMP11 expression was used to stratify primary tumors. In addition, we assessed the in vitro effects of CAFs on both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell invasion and endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation. We found that the expression levels of most of the genes tested were significantly increased in both breast cancer-derived cell lines after co-culture with CAFs from either MMP11+ or MMP11- MIC tumors. IL-6 and IL-8 showed an increased expression in both cancer-derived cell lines after co-culture with CAFs from MMP11+ MIC tumors. We also found that the invasive and angiogenic capacities of, respectively, MDA-MB-231 and HUVEC cells were increased after co-culture with CAFs, especially those from MMP11+ MIC tumors. Our data indicate that tumor-derived CAFs can induce up-regulation of genes involved in breast cancer progression. Our data additionally indicate that CAFs, especially those derived from MMP11+ MIC tumors, can promote breast cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis.",

We found that PFD had inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production of CAFs in 2D culture. Furthermore, CAFs enhanced tumor growth and PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs by causing apoptosis in the 3D co-culture assay of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. In vivo, PFD alone inhibited tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling but did not inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis.

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

Our findings further extend the molecular mechanisms through which the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cancer progression.IntroductionThe cooperative interactions among tumor cells and reactive stroma strongly contribute to cancer development and progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been indicated as the main cellular component of the tumor microenvironment involved in cancer initiation, invasion and metastasis. In breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor progression and resistance to therapeutics through multiple mechanisms, including the stimulation of new blood vessels, mainly generated by a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Indeed, mechanisms of cell sensing and adaptation to stressful environments are activated within the hypoxic tumor mass, leading to the growth and aggressiveness of malignant cells. The transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) primarily mediates the cell responses to a low oxygen tension playing a crucial role in cancer development. In particular, HIF-1 activates a signaling transduction network which drives the adaptation of tumor cells to hypoxic conditions towards a more aggressive cancer phenotype. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein composed of the hypoxia-inducible \u03b1 subunit and the constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2 dimerize upon exposure to hypoxia, generating a complex which binds to the hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) located within the promoter region of target genes. In this regard, it has been shown that HIF-1 is a leading regulator of tumor angiogenesis following hypoxia, as it regulates the expression of several pro-angiogenic factors, like the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Recently, we discovered a further HIF-1-regulated gene, the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER), which contributes to the adaptation to a low oxygen environment in breast cancer cells and in cardiomyocytes. In particular, we found that the cooperation between GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 upon exposure to hypoxia leads to the up-regulation of the Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which is a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER. Surprisingly, we also assessed that in CAFs derived from breast cancer malignancies GPER acts as a transcription factor promoting the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and migration. On the basis of these data, GPER-mediated functions may be included among the mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment.Considering that hypoxia regulates HIF-1\u03b1-dependent expression of both GPER and VEGF in different model systems, in the present study we aimed to evaluate the potential involvement of GPER in the expression and function of VEGF in CAFs and breast cancer cells. In this regard, we demonstrate that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates the up-regulation of VEGF as well as the endothelial tube formation, suggesting that this transduction pathway may be involved in the intricate stimulatory responses to hypoxia within the cancer stroma. Our data may open new perspectives towards innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the breast cancer microenvironment.Materials and methodsReagentsCobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Srl (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) was obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). Human CTGF was purchased from MBL International Corporation, distributed by Eppendorf, (Milan, Italy). Human VEGF was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC, CTGF and VEGF, which were solubilized in water.Ethics statementAll procedures conformed to the Helsinki Declaration for the research on humans. The experimental research has been performed with the ethical approval provided by the Ethics Committee of the Regional Hospital in Cosenza, Italy.Cell culturesThe SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) without phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The murine cardiomyocyte-like cell line HL-1 was kindly provided by Dr. William C. Claycomb (Louisiana State University Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA). In particular, the HL-1 cell line was established from a mouse atrial cardiomyocyte tumor excised from an adult female Jackson Laboratory-inbred C57BLy6J mouse (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA). HL-1 cells were cultured according to the published protocol in Claycomb medium (JRH Biosciences, Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 10% FBS (JRH Bioscience, Sigma-Aldrich Srl), 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), 0.1 mM norepinephrine (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy), supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). All cell lines were grown in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. For hypoxic stimulation, cells were treated with CoCl2 or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) in a HeraCell incubator (ThermoScientific-Heraeus, Milan, Italy). Cells were switched to medium without serum the day before experiments.Isolation, cultivation and characterization of CAFsCAFs were extracted from six invasive mammary ductal carcinomas obtained from mastectomies as previously described. Signed informed consent from all the patients and IRB approval were obtained. In particular, tissues obtained were cut into smaller pieces (1 to 2 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90 \u00d7 g for two minutes. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485 \u00d7 g for eight minutes, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham's F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) and cultured at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. In each patient, a second population of fibroblasts was isolated from a noncancerous breast tissue at least 2 cm from the outer tumor margin. CAFs and fibroblasts were then expanded into two 15-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. We used CAFs and fibroblasts passaged for up to five population doublings for subsequent experiments to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. Primary cells cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001), all antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy). In order to assess fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA (Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All experiments were performed in each CAF population obtained from six patients. Data presented were obtained in CAFs derived from one patient; however, results similar to those shown were found in CAFs derived from the other five patients.Gene reporter assaysThe 2.6 kb VEGF promoter-luciferase construct containing full-length VEGF promoter sequence (22,361 to +298 bp relative to the transcription start site) used in luciferase assays was a kind gift from Dr. Pal Soumitro (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA). CAFs or SkBr3 cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u03bcL/well culture medium containing 10% FBS and transfected for 24 h with control shRNA, shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER. Next, a mixture containing 0.5 \u03bcg of reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK was transfected within cells. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). After 8 h, cells were treated with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed to low oxygen (2% O2) for 12 h in serum-free medium. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) normalized to the internal transfection control provided by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were set as one-fold induction, from which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.Gene expression studiesTotal RNA was extracted from cell cultures using the Trizol commercial kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not degraded and showed clear 18S and 28S bands under ultraviolet light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription using the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression of selected genes was quantified by both real-time RT-PCR using Step One\u00ae sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Milan, Italy) and semiquantitative RT-PCR. Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and are as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'-TGCATCTCCATCTTCTACCCAAGT-3' and Rev: 5'-CCGACTGTGAGTGCCACTGT-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'-ACACACCTGGGTGGACACAA-3' and Rev: 5'-GGAGCCAGAAGCCACATCTG-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ACCTGTGGGATGGGCATCT-3' and Rev: 5'-CAGGCGGCTCTGCTTCTCTA-3'; VEGF (human): Fwd: 5'- TGCAGATTATGCGGATCAAACC-3' and Rev: 5'- TGCATTCACATTTGTTGTGCTGTAG-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'- GGAGATCCTTCGAGGAGCACTT-3' and Rev: 5'- GGCGATTTA GCAGCAGATATAAGAA-3'; 18S (human, mouse) Fwd: 5'-GGCGTCCCCCAACTTCTTA-3' and Rev: 5'- GGGCATCACAGACCTGTTATT -3. The ribosomal protein 18S was used as a control gene to obtain normalized values.For semiquantitative PCR, primers were as follows: HIF-1\u03b1 Fwd: 5'- GCTGATTTGTGAACCCAT TC-3' and Rev: 5'- CTGTACTGTCCTGTGGTGAC-3'; GPER Fwd: 5'- CTGGGGAGTTTCCTG TCTGA -3' and Rev: 5'-GCTTGGGAAGTCACATCCAT-3'; CTGF Fwd: 5'-ATGGCATGAAGCCAGAGAGT-3' and Rev: 3'-GGTCAGTGAGCACGCTAAAA-3'; VEGF (human) Fwd: 5'-GAGCTTCAGGACATTGCTGT-3' and Rev: 5'-AGGAAGGTCAACCACTCACA-3'; VEGF (mouse) Fwd: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3' and Rev: 5'-CGTGTAAATGTTCCTGCAAA-3'; 36B4 (human) Fwd: 5'-CTCAACATCTCCCCCTTCTC-3' and Rev: 5'-CAAATCCCATATCCTCGTCC-3'; GAPDH (mouse) Fwd: 5'-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3' and Rev: 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3'. 36B4 and GAPDH were used as control genes to obtain normalized values.Western blot analysisTo prepare lysates, CAFs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized with 50 mM Hepes solution, pH 7.4, containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined according to the Bradford method. Cell lysates (10 to 50 \u03bcg of protein) were electrophoresed through a reducing SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary polyclonal IgG antibody for HIF-1\u03b1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Celbio, Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), CTGF (L-20), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), \u03b2-actin (C2), b-tubulin (H-235-2) and appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies, all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA). The levels of proteins and phosphoproteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and revealed using the ECL\u00ae System (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy).Gene silencing experimentsCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected for 24 h before treatments with a control vector or an independent shRNA sequence for each target gene using Fugene6 (Roche Diagnostics). The shRNA plasmid for HIF-1\u03b1 and the respective control plasmids were purchased from SABioscience Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA). The silencing of GPER expression was obtained by the construct which we have previously described and used.Immunofluorescence microscopyFifty percent confluent cultured CAFs, SkBr3 and HL-1 cells grown on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 or exposed for 12 h to low oxygen tension (2% O2). Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated with 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI), (1:1,000), (Sigma-Aldrich Srl) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen). For knockdown experiments, cells were previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids (as described above) and then treated for 12 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, or cultured under hypoxia as indicated. Leica AF6000 Advanced Fluorescence Imaging System supported by quantification and image processing software Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (Leica Microsystems CMS, GbH Mannheim, Germany) were used for experiment evaluation.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCAFs were grown in 10-cm dishes to 60 to 70% confluence, serum deprived for 24 h and then treated with vehicle or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY, USA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primer for the -1,216 to -883 region of the human VEGF promoter containing the HRE site is 5'-CACAGACCTTCACAGCCATC-3' (forward hHRE) and 5'-CCCAGCGTAGACAGTTGAGT-3' (reverse hHRE). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation. For knockdown experiments CAFs were previously transfected in serum-free medium for 24 h with shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER and the respective control shRNA (as described above) and then treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2.Migration assayMigration assays were performed with CAFs in triplicate using Boyden chambers (Costar Transwell, 8 mm polycarbonate membrane, Sigma Aldrich Srl). CAFs were transfected with shRNA constructs directed against HIF-1\u03b1, GPER or with an unrelated control shRNA construct in regular growth medium. After 24 h, cells were exposed to low oxygen tension (2% O2) or normoxia (20% O2) for 6 h in medium without serum. Then, cells were maintained for 24 h in normoxic conditions (20% O2) in medium without serum. This experimental condition has been designed in order to reproduce the unbalanced oxygenation occurring within solid tumors, where the irregular blood flow is responsible for hypoxia and reoxygenation phases. CAFs were, therefore, trypsinized and seeded in the upper chambers. CTGF (100 ng/mL) was added to the medium without serum in the bottom wells where applicable. Six hours after seeding, cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed and counted.Conditioned mediumCAFs were cultured in regular growth medium to 80% confluence. Then, cells were washed twice with PBS and transfected in serum-free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with shHIF-1\u03b1, shGPER or control shRNA using Fugene 6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics) for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were incubated under normoxic or hypoxic (2% O2) conditions for 12 h. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in HUVECs.Protein precipitation with Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)Conditioned medium from CAFs (see above) was collected, centrifuged at 16,000 g for five minutes to remove cell debris and 10 \u03bcg/mL BSA (final concentration) was added as a control for precipitation efficiency. TCA (100% solution) was added to a final concentration of 20% to conditioned media. After a 20-minute incubation on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 31,000 g for 20 minutes (4\u00b0C). Pellets were washed with cold acetone, centrifuged at 31,000 g for 30 minutes (4\u00b0C), air dried and resuspended in protein lysis buffer (described above). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford Method and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using 100 \u03bcg protein/lane.Tube formation assayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37\u00b0C in serum free medium (EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen, Inc., Helgerman Court, Gaithersburg, USA) was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates and left at 37\u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Invitrogen), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel\u00ae and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls' testing to determine differences in means. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.ResultsHypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression in CAFsIn order to provide further insight into the response to hypoxia in main components of the tumor microenvironment like CAFs, we began our study showing that hypoxia induces the mRNA expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and its target gene GPER, as ascertained by real time PCR (Figure 1) and semi-quantitative PCR (data not shown). In particular, CAFs were treated from 1 h to 24 h with the hypoxia mimetic agent CoCl2 (100 \u03bcM) (Figure 1a) or cultured in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1b). The induction of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mRNA expression was paralleled by increased protein levels of these factors in CAFs treated from 1 h to 24 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 1c) or exposed to a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Figure 1d). Next, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 expression, the induction of GPER by CoCl2 was abrogated (Figure 1e, Additional file 1a), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in CAFs exposed to hypoxic conditions. In order to assess the transduction signaling involved in the aforementioned responses, we determined the rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation (from 15 minutes up to 60 minutes) following the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (Figure 2a). Accordingly, we observed similar effects on ERK1/2 activation culturing CAFs in the presence of low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (Figure 2b). Next, the treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 for 30 minutes in the presence of 300 \u03bcM of the ROS scavenger NAC did not induce the ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 2c). Moreover, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER observed treating CAFs for 3 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 was no longer evident in the presence of 300 \u03bcM NAC and 10 \u03bcM of the MEK inhibitor PD (Figure 2d). On the basis of these results, it could be argued that hypoxia-induced ROS may trigger the ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is involved in the up-regulation of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression.Hypoxia induces the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in CAFs. (a-d) The exposure to 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a, c) or low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 3 h) (b, d) up-regulate the mRNA (a, b) and protein (c, d) expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER as evaluated by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. In RNA experiments, values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. (e) The up-regulation of GPER observed treating CAFs for 6 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 is abrogated by silencing HIF-1\u03b1. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. Side panel shows densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.Hypoxia stimulates the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER through ERK1/2 activation in CAFs. The treatment with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (a) or the exposure to low oxygen tension (2% O2 for 30 minutes) (b) induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is prevented by using 300 \u03bcM of the free radical scavenger NAC (c). (d) Immunoblots of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER from CAFs treated for 3 h with vehicle (-) or 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 alone and in combination with 300 \u03bcM NAC or 10 \u03bcM ERK1/2 inhibitor PD. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to ERK/2 or \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb), (\u25cf) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cultured under normoxia vs cells treated with CoCl2 or cells cultured under hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the expression of VEGF induced by hypoxiaConsidering the ability of a low oxygen environment to trigger the production of pro-angiogenic factors in solid tumors, we aimed to evaluate whether hypoxia may promote the expression of an important HIF-1\u03b1 target gene like VEGF. As shown in Figure 3a, the treatment with CoCl2 induced the mRNA expression of VEGF in a time-dependent manner in both CAFs and SkBr3 breast cancer cells. Similar results were obtained in a completely different model system, such as HL-1 cardiomyocytes (Additional file 2). Next, CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) activated a VEGF promoter reporter gene which was transfected in CAFs and SkBr3 cells (Figure 3b, c). Notably, the aforementioned transcriptional response to hypoxia was abrogated knocking-down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 3d, e and Additional file 1c, d). CoCl2 and a low oxygen tension (2% O2) promoted also VEGF protein expression in CAFs, as evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 4). The induction of VEGF protein levels was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Figure 5 and Additional file 1a, b), further highlighting their involvement in the regulation of VEGF by hypoxia. Analogously, the up-regulation of VEGF protein expression upon exposure to hypoxia in SkBr3 (Figure 6a) and HL-1 cells (Figure 7a) was no longer evident, knocking down the expression of GPER (Figures 6b and 7b and Additional file 1e) and HIF-1 \u03b1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the regulation of VEGF expression induced by hypoxia.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in the hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of VEGF.

Images shown are representative of 20 random fields of three independent experiments.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the VEGF promoter and involved in VEGF-mediated tube formation induced by hypoxiaAs HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are required for the hypoxia-induced VEGF expression, we next determined by ChIP assay that HIF-1\u03b1 (Figure 8a) and GPER (Figure 8b) are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter sequence in CAFs exposed to CoCl2 for 1 h. Interestingly, GPER was required for the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of VEGF, as evidenced knocking-down the expression of GPER (Figure 8c). In parallel, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the recruitment of GPER to the HRE site within the VEGF promoter sequence (Figure 8d). Altogether, these findings suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER leads to the hypoxia-induced transcription of VEGF.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are recruited to the VEGF promoter sequence. CAFs treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 were submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (a) or anti-GPER (b) antibodies. For knockdown experiments, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA and shGPER (c) or with control shRNA and shHIF-1\u03b1 (d), treated for 1 h with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 and then submitted to the chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-HIF-1\u03b1 (c) or anti-GPER (d) antibodies. The amplified sequences were evaluated by real-time PCR. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle vs CoCl2 treatment.On the basis of these data, we then examined whether conditioned medium from hypoxia-stimulated CAFs could promote in HUVECs the formation of tubule-like structures that represent a useful model system for the evaluation of the neoangiogenesis process. In particular, HUVECs were cultured on GFR-Matrigel\u00ae-coated plates which prevent the formation of capillary-like structures, as previously reported. Notably, HUVECs cultured in normoxic medium from CAFs did not assemble into cord-like structures, while HUVECs grown in medium from CAFs maintained in hypoxic conditions (2% O2 for 12 h) displayed a complex ramified network of tubules (Figure 9a). Moreover, in HUVECs cultured with hypoxic medium (2% O2 for 12 h) collected from CAFs, which were previously transfected with a shHIF-1\u03b1 or shGPER, tube formation was no longer observed (Figure 9b, c). The addition of 10 ng/mL VEGF to the hypoxic medium from GPER-silenced CAFs restored the ability to form tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure 9c). The aforementioned findings were quantified and recapitulated in Additional file 3. Next, we determined that the up-regulation of VEGF protein levels in hypoxic medium from CAFs is no longer evident, knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression (Additional file 4). Hence, these results clearly suggest that VEGF may be considered as a target of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced tube formation. Tube formation was evaluated in HUVECs cultured for 2 h in medium collected from CAFs which were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). To this end, CAFs were transfected with control shRNA (a), shHIF-1\u03b1 (b) or shGPER (c) and exposed to hypoxia, as indicated. Tube formation is rescued in HUVECs treated with 10 ng/mL VEGF and cultured in medium from CAFs transfected with shGPER and cultured under hypoxia (2% O2 for 12 h). Data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are involved in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFsIn order to further corroborate the stimulatory role exerted by HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in hypoxic conditions, we turned to a different model system. CoCl2 and low oxygen tension (2% O2) induced CTGF up-regulation at both mRNA (Figure 10a) and protein level (Figure 10b, c) in CAFs. Silencing HIF-1\u03b1 as well as knocking down GPER expression, the up-regulation of CTGF upon CoCl2 was abolished (Figure 10d, e). As a biological counterpart, the migration of CAFs cultured under low oxygen tension (2% O2) was prevented, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression and rescued, adding CTGF (Figure 10f). Collectively, our data may suggest that HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling mediates different biological outcomes in CAFs exposed to hypoxia.Involvement of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER in hypoxia-induced expression of CTGF and migration of CAFs. (a) The mRNA expression of CTGF is induced after the stimulation of CAFs with 100 \u03bcM CoCl2, as indicated. Values are normalized to the 18S expression and shown as fold changes of mRNA expression induced by CoCl2 compared to cells treated with vehicle. The protein expression of CTGF is induced by 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 (b) or low oxygen tension (2% O2, for 4 h) (c). The up-regulation of CTGF protein expression observed upon 100 \u03bcM CoCl2 treatment is abrogated silencing HIF-1\u03b1 (d) or GPER (e) expression. The migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) is prevented knocking down HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression. Cell migration is rescued in CAFs transfected with shGPER, exposed to hypoxia (2% O2, for 6 h) and treated with 100 ng/ml CTGF (f). Results shown are representative of three independent experiments. Side panels show densitometric analysis of the blots normalized to \u03b2-actin. (\u25cb) P < 0.05 for cells receiving vehicle (-) or cells cultured under normoxia versus CoCl2 treatment or cells cultured under hypoxia.DiscussionIn the present study, we provide novel evidence regarding the regulation of VEGF, which plays a fundamental role in mediating hypoxia-induced tumor angiogenesis. In particular, our results demonstrate that a low oxygen tension stimulates through the ERK1/2 transduction pathway the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent expression of GPER, which contributes to the regulation of VEGF in both CAFs and breast cancer cells. Moreover, we show that following hypoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the VEGF promoter region and cooperatively act as a functional complex for the transcription of VEGF. As a biological counterpart, we evidence that HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER mediate endothelial tube formation in HUVECs cultured in medium from CAFs which were previously exposed to hypoxia. Further corroborating these findings, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER regulates the expression of the migratory factor CTGF, which has been acknowledged as a target gene of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.HIF-1 is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and acts as a survival factor in hypoxic tumor environment, mainly activating the transcription of genes involved in glycolytic metabolism, oxygen consumption, cell migration and invasion. Besides, hypoxia stimulates through HIF-1 the expression of anti-apoptotic, proliferative and angiogenic factors that drastically change the biological properties of tumor cells towards malignant features. In this context, we have recently demonstrated that GPER may be included among the HIF-1 target genes as the up-regulation of GPER induced by hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to the HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in breast cancer cells and cardiomyocytes. In particular, GPER-mediated the antiapoptotic effects exerted by estrogens in hypoxic conditions, suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the adaptation of cancer cells to a low oxygen environment.GPER may be considered as a predictor of cancer malignancy and aggressiveness considering that its expression has been associated with negative clinical features and poor survival rates in diverse types of tumors. Therefore, huge efforts are currently underway to unravel the mechanisms that rule its regulation and function. Indeed, the development and characterization of drugs that target key players of cancer progression like GPCRs, and particularly GPER, are currently innovative topics under investigation.In this context, estrogenic GPER signaling has been shown to trigger relevant biological effects like proliferation and migration in diverse cancer cells and in CAFs derived from breast tumors. Notably, GPER exhibited the peculiar property to act in CAFs as a transcriptional regulator together with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), hence leading to the up-regulation of Cyclin D, which has been largely involved in cell proliferation. Increasing evidence has suggested that CAFs may drive cancer phenotype mainly through a paracrine action exerted by the production of various growth factors and chemokines secreted in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the stromal contribution to the development of a wide variety of tumors has been supported by animal models of cancer pathogenesis and extensive clinical studies. In this vein, it has been shown that malignant cells recruit into the tumor mass diverse stromal components like CAFs, inflammatory and vascular cells that actively cooperate towards cancer progression. In particular, CAFs elicit in breast carcinomas relevant biological activities, including the stimulation of new blood vessels formation, which closely correlates with cancer growth, metastasis and poor prognosis. In this context, our present data add a further mechanism through which the tumor microenvironment may promote angiogenesis, as the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling was shown to mediate the up-regulation of VEGF expression in CAFs cultured in hypoxic conditions. Considering that VEGF is one of the most important factors mediating the complex process of angiogenesis, its action has been widely involved in the development of many types of tumors, including breast cancer. Accordingly, it has been shown that the ectopic expression of VEGF in MCF-7 breast cancer cells may promote tumor growth in vivo , whereas the blockade of VEGF has been associated with the growth arrest of breast carcinomas in nude mice. Thus, given the crucial role exerted by VEGF in tumor development and prognosis, a great deal of interest is currently addressed to a better understanding of its regulation and function. In this regard, VEGF was shown to be regulated by hypoxia mainly through HIF-1\u03b1, which may interact with numerous factors to boost VEGF expression. Further extending the current knowledge on the complex regulation of VEGF, our data suggest that GPER may contribute to the HIF-1\u03b1 mediated transcriptional responses in hypoxic tumor microenvironment towards new blood vessel formation. Notably, an increased VEGF production was recently shown to parallel an elevated GPER expression in endometrial cancer patients with low survival rates. These data in combination with our findings may suggest that in estrogen-dependent cancer cells diverse molecular mechanisms could converge on the production of cytokines and growth factors, promoting an enhancement of malignant epithelial growth and invasion through autocrine and/or paracrine pathways. Interestingly, we have determined that the up-regulation of VEGF relied on HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling also in HL-1 cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia, suggesting that this transduction mechanism may be implicated in additional pathophysiological conditions, such as the hypoxic myocardium. In this regard, it should be mentioned that recent studies have suggested a cardioprotective role exerted by GPER in stressful conditions following hypoxia. These data in combination with the results obtained in the present study may indicate that GPER could elicit cardiotropic effects also through its ability to regulate the expression of VEGF, which mainly contributes to adaptive responses following myocardial ischemic injury.As it concerns the signaling cascades activated by hypoxia, we here demonstrate that the ROS-mediated ERK1/2 activation is involved in the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression upon low oxygen tension. In this regard, it should be mentioned that ROS play a relevant role in the biological responses to re-oxygenation; however, decreased oxygen levels may be sufficient to trigger HIF-1-dependent gene expression through the ROS production. In addition, the rapid responses to hypoxia are mediated by multiple transduction pathways activated also upon GPER stimulation. Further studies are needed to better clarify the functional cross-talk between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER, particularly following both hypoxic and estrogenic stimulations. For instance, estrogens regulate HIF-1\u03b1 expression and function in a stressful environment, indicating an intricate cooperation between these two main factors mainly involved in tumor progression. Interestingly, in the current investigation, the biological interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER upon hypoxic conditions was corroborated by the up-regulation of an important migratory stimulator and GPER target gene like CTGF. Accordingly, the migration of CAFs induced by hypoxia was abolished, silencing HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER expression, hence confirming their contribution to this relevant cell response.The results obtained in the current study may also disclose a unique ligand-independent action elicited by GPER. This issue could be a further attractive topic which remains to be elucidated in future studies.Altogether, our findings recapitulate in CAFs exposed to hypoxia the engagement of the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling towards the regulation of pivotal genes involved in angiogenic and metastatic processes. Anyway, further studies are required to better define the role exerted by this transduction pathway in diverse pathophysiological conditions as well as the molecular mechanisms driving the biological responses to hypoxia through the functional interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER.ConclusionsWithin the tumor microenvironment exposed to hypoxia, CAFs have been involved in the generation of new blood vessels which mainly support cancer progression. Our current data highlight the stimulatory role exerted by the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling in the multistep process of tumor neoangiogenesis fostered by CAFs. Considering the crucial interplay between cancer cells and stroma, the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction pathway may be pointed out as a further biological target towards innovative treatments in breast cancer.AbbreviationsCAFs: Carcinoma activated fibroblasts; CTGF: connective tissue growth factor; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; DAPI: 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride; EGFR: epidermal growth factor receptor; EGM: endothelial growth medium; ERK: extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FAP\u03b1: fibroblast activated protein \u03b1; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GPER: G-Protein estrogen receptor; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; HREs: hypoxia-responsive elements; HUVECs: human umbilical vein endothelial cells; N-acetyl-L-cysteine; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF: phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; TCA: trichloroacetic acid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsEMDF designed and performed the experiments, and wrote the paper.

Triple-negative breast cancer accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. This study describes a new cancer-associated fibroblast subtype characterized by high ER\u03b136 levels that secretes HGF, which can impact triple-negative breast cancer. The data enlighten the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the significance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.AbstractBackground: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Estrogen receptor alpha 36 (ER\u03b136), the alternatively spliced variant of ER\u03b1, is described as an unfavorable factor when expressed in cancer cells. ER\u03b1 can be expressed also in CAFs; however, the role of ER\u03b136 in CAFs is unknown. Methods: Four CAF cultures were isolated from chemotherapy-na\u00efve BC patients and characterized for ER\u03b136 expression and the NanoString gene expression panel using isolated RNA. Conditioned media from CAF cultures were used to assess the influence of CAFs on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells using a matrigel 3D culture assay. Results: We found that ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly induced the branching of TNBC cells in vitro (p < 0.001). They also produced a set of pro-tumorigenic cytokines compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs, among which hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the main inducer of TNBC cell invasive phenotype in vitro (p < 0.001). Tumor stroma rich in ER\u03b136high CAFs was correlated with high Ki67 expression (p = 0.041) and tumor-associated macrophages markers (CD68 and CD163, p = 0.041 for both). HGF was found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor in TCGA database analysis (p = 0.03 for DFS and p = 0.04 for OS). Conclusions: Breast cancer-associated fibroblasts represent distinct subtypes based on ER\u03b136 expression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs could account for an unfavorable prognosis for TNBC patients.1. IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

        "content": "BACKGROUND Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key factors in malignant tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. However, the effect of CAFs autophagy on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells is not clear. In this study, the growth effect of TNBC cells regulated by CAFs autophagy was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS CAFs were obtained from invasive TNBC tumors and identified by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining assay. CAFs were co-cultured with TNBC cells, and migration and invasion were evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and Transwell inserts. TNBC cells growth was detected by MTT assay, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by CAFs was evaluated by Western blot assay. RESULTS CAFs were identified by the high expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) protein. Autophagy-relevant Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels in CAFs were higher than those in NFs (P&lt;0.05). TNBC cells migration, invasion, and proliferation levels were significantly improved in the CAFs-conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) group, compared with the other 3 groups (P&lt;0.05).

However, the effect of CAFs autophagy on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells is not clear. In this study, the growth effect of TNBC cells regulated by CAFs autophagy was evaluated.Material/MethodsCAFs were obtained from invasive TNBC tumors and identified by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining assay.

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

Friedman and two\u2010sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests detected significant perturbations in expression of marker genes. Paracrine signal from cancer spheroids induced vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in CAF but not in fetal lung fibroblasts.ConclusionWe have established perturbation\u2010based monitoring of patients\u2019 CAF. Further data collection and individual patient follow up is ongoing to identify critical determinants of disease outcome.INTRODUCTIONGenomic mutations of cancer cells are considered the driving force of tumor development and progression. However, cancers develop in complex tissue microenvironments which contain genetically normal stromal cells.1, 2 Pathologists have observed that not only the mutation profile of cancer cells, but also stromal activation is a predictor of patients\u2019 prognosis.3, 4, 5, 6 Among several stromal cell types, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF) play a crucial role in angiogenesis and are attractive therapeutic targets.7 However, specifically inhibiting CAF is a challenging task. Fibroblasts and their derivatives show great heterogeneity, depending on their tissue of origin8 and their association with various environmental contexts.7 Overall, patient outcomes are difficult to predict even when the genomic alterations are fully grasped through sequencing.9 Genome biologists are becoming aware of the importance of \u201cperturbation\u2010based functional monitoring\u201d9, 10 for precision medicine to achieve its goal. In systems biology, \u201cperturbation\u201d is defined as an alteration of the function of biological systems by external or internal means such as environmental stimuli.11 Clinical regimens change tumor microenvironments and monitoring the responses of CAF is equally important in the monitoring of cancer cells. In this study, we collected and cultured patient\u2010derived CAF and carried out perturbation\u2010based monitoring of 18 marker genes.METHODSPatients and biospecimensThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dokkyo Medical University (ID: 28019) and Ibaraki Medical Center of Tokyo Medical University (ID: 16\u201043) on the basis of the Ethical Guidelines for Clinical Research of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan. Patients who were diagnosed as having malignancy at Ibaraki Medical Center agreed to donate the surgically resected tumor specimens for research purposes. Written informed consents have been obtained from all patients. Tumor specimens from 27 patients were used in this study (Table\u00a01).Case description of tumor specimens used in the present studyPatient ID\tAge (y)\tGender\tTumor location\tTumor histology\tTNM stage\t \t1\t61\tM\tHepatocellular\tModerate\tI\t \t2\t62\tM\tHepatocellular\tModerate\tII\t \t3\t80\tM\tCholangiocellular\tPoor\tIVa\t \t4\t69\tM\tGastric\tWell\tIa\t \t5\t60\tF\tGastric\tPoor\tIV\t \t6\t83\tF\tGastric\tPoor\tIIIb\t \t7\t67\tM\tGastric\tND\tND\t \t8\t49\tF\tSigmoid colon\tModerate\tIIIb\t \t9\t66\tF\tAscending colon\tModerate\tIIa\t \t10\t84\tF\tRectum\tPapillary adeno\tIIa\t \t11\t72\tM\tTransverse colon\tModerate\tIIa\t \t12\t68\tM\tCecum\tModerate\tII\t \t13\t48\tF\tRectum\tModerate\tIIIb\t \t14\t68\tF\tDescending colon\tModerate\tIIIa\t \t15\t79\tF\tRectal\tModerate\tIIa\t \t16\t75\tM\tLiver meta (rectum)\tModerate\tIVb\t \t17\t44\tM\tHepatocellular\tModerate\tI\t \t18\t76\tF\tPancreatic\tModerate\tIIa\t \t19\t74\tM\tLiver meta (sigmoid)\tModerate\tIIb\t \t20\t79\tF\tTransverse colon\tModerate\tIIa\t \t21\t59\tM\tLiver meta (rectum)\tModerate\tIVb\t \t22\t65\tM\tVater's ampulla\tModerate\tIVb\t \t23\t75\tF\tLiver meta (rectum)\tModerate\tIVb\t \t24\t78\tM\tGallbladder\tModerate\tIIIb\t \t25\t70\tM\tAscending colon\tModerate\tIIIb\t \t26\t60\tM\tPancreatic\tModerate\tIVb\t \t27\t68\tF\tLiver meta (rectum)\tMucinous\tIVb\t \tadeno, adenocarcinoma; meta, metastasis; ND, not determined.Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts were derived from tumor samples (ID1\u201015). Cancer tissue\u2010originated spheroids were derived from tumor samples (ID1\u201027) and the latter half (ID16\u201027) were used for coculture with fetal lung fibroblasts.Cell cultureTumor specimens were washed vigorously with saline and transported from Ibaraki Medical Center to Dokkyo Medical University by refrigerated courier service. We first confirmed that both the CAF and the cancer tissue\u2010originated spheroids (CTOS) were mostly viable after transportation. Neoadjuvant chemotherapies could affect the viability of both CAF and CTOS. However, only a few patients fulfilled the condition in this study (Table\u00a01, patients with ID21 and ID27), making the statistical determination difficult. Dissociation of primary culture of specimens was modified from a previously reported protocol.12 Briefly, tumors were minced with surgical scissors and further digested enzymatically in a collagenase/proteinase cocktail (0.1% collagenase and 0.1% dispase II; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) for 60\u00a0minutes in a reciprocating water bath shaker at 37\u00b0C. The digested tissue was washed by phosphate\u2010buffered saline (PBS) and fractionated according to the speed of sedimentation. Fast\u2010settling fraction contained cell clumps, eventually forming floating CTOS in a low\u2010attachment culture dish (AGC Techno Glass, Shizuoka, Japan). Slowly settling fraction contained fully digested single cells such as CAF and blood cells. After CAF attached to the plastic dish, floating cells and debris were removed and subsequent cell division of CAF further increased cell purity. We observed epithelial\u2010like cancer cells occasionally attached to the plate but such cells were removed as a result of the much slower cell division compared to CAF (data not shown). Fetal lung\u2010derived human fibroblasts (TIG\u20103) was purchased from JCRB Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan). The culture medium for CTOS was serum\u2010free advanced DMEM/F\u201012 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with fibroblast growth factor\u20102 (10\u00a0ng/mL; ReproCell, Kanagawa, Japan), l\u2010Alanyl\u2010l\u2010glutamine (2\u00a0mmol/L; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) and antibiotic cocktail (gentamicin, penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical). The culture medium for CAF and TIG\u20103 was advanced RPMI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (GE Healthcare Hyclone, Chicago, IL, USA), l\u2010alanyl\u2010l\u2010glutamine and antibiotic cocktail.PerturbationPerturbation (functional alteration by external stimuli) was measured by comparing gene expression between control culture and particular stimulus. CAF were split into four or five dishes and used for the experiment. Culture condition of each stimulus was as follows: (i) hypoxia treatment: cells were incubated in hypoxic chamber (1% O2; Astec, Fukuoka, Japan) for 6\u00a0hours; (ii) exposure to chemotherapy compound, 3.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL cisplatin (Nichi\u2010Iko Pharmaceutical, Toyama, Japan); (iii) exposure to 312.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL fluorouracil (Towa Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) for 3\u00a0days. Concentration of cisplatin or fluorouracil was determined based on IC50 in pilot experiments (data not shown) and only the cells surviving chemical exposure were harvested for analysis. (iv) Coculture with CTOS (fibroblasts and CTOS were separated by Millicell cell culture insert; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) for 3\u00a0days. Culture insert (polycarbonate membrane) hindered carcinoma cells from contacting with fibroblasts directly, but allowed communication with each other through paracrine signals such as cytokines and extracellular vesicles.13 Gene expression analysisTotal RNA was extracted from fibroblasts (CAF and TIG\u20103) with or without experimental stimulus (RNAiso plus; Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). PrimeScript RT reagent kit with gDNA eraser (DNase) was used for reverse transcription (Takara Bio). PCR conditions and reagents are described elsewhere.14 For data acquisition, we used a QuantStudio 3 Real\u2010Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Taqman method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were quantified according to the modified delta\u2010cycle threshold (\u0394C T) method and the \u0394C T value was used for statistical analysis.15 In figures, expression level is presented as log2 (relative expression)\u00a0=\u00a020 (arbitrary constant)\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u0394C T. We selected 18 genes that encode components for fibroblast activation, paracrine communications, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, for monitoring dynamic behaviors during perturbation. Previous study indicated that the dynamics of biologically relevant markers could reflect the stepwise differentiation model of CAF.16 Gene\u2010specific Taqman probes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Catalog number of each fluorescent probe is as follows: Eukaryotic 18S rRNA endogenous control (4352930E), ACTA2 (Hs00426835_g1), CXCL12 (Hs03676656_mH), MMP2 (Hs01548727_m1), S100A4 (Hs00243202_m1), TGFB1 (Hs00998133_m1), TNC (Hs01115665_m1), VEGFA (Hs00900055_m1), VIM (Hs00958111_m1), FN1 (Hs01549976_m1), HGF (Hs00300159_m1), IL6 (Hs00174131_m1), LOX (Hs00942483_m1), MMP9 (Hs00957562_m1), POSTN (Hs01566750_m1), TNF (Hs01113624_g1), CXCL8 (Hs00174103_m1), PDGFA (Hs00234994_m1), PTGES (Hs00610420_m1).Western blotting and fluorescent immunostainingCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts under various perturbations were harvested and whole\u2010cell proteins were dissolved with solubilizer (7\u00a0mol/L urea, 2\u00a0mol/L thiourea, 4% CHAPS; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The entangled genomic DNA was sheared by sonication for 30\u00a0minutes at 4\u00b0C. Procedures\u00a0for\u00a0western blotting have been described elsewhere.14 Primary antibodies used are as follows: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\u2010A from Protein Tech (#19003\u20101\u2010AP, Rosemont, IL, USA) and GAPDH from Cell Signaling Technology (#5174, Danvers, MA, USA). Experiments were reproduced twice with different passage points. In the histological procedure, \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2010SMA) and VEGF\u2010A were detected using dual immunofluorescence staining. Paraffin\u2010embedded sections (5\u2010\u03bcm thick) underwent standard deparaffinization and rehydration steps. The sections were treated with antigen retrieval solution, pH\u00a09, (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 1\u00a0minute at 105\u00b0C using an autoclave machine (TOMY Digital Biology, Tokyo, Japan). Subsequently, the sections were blocked with 5% (v/v) normal donkey serum in PBS with Triton X\u2010100 (0.3%) for 60\u00a0minutes. The sections were incubated with goat \u03b1\u2010SMA antibody (1:500; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA) and rabbit VEGF\u2010A antibody (1:500; Bioss Antibodies, Woburn, MA, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 antigoat IgG, 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK, and Alexa Fluor 594 antirabbit IgG, 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology) for 2\u00a0hours at room temperature. Finally, the sections were counterstained and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade with DAPI (Cell Signaling Technology). Microscopic digital images were taken using a fluorescent microscope (BZ\u2010X710; Keyence Corp., Osaka, Japan).Statistical procedureAll statistical tests were carried out using SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). To detect the main effect by a difference in tissue of origin, Kruskal\u2010Wallis multivariate analysis for variance (MANOVA) was used. Data of all perturbations were included, as the variance could be interpreted as clinically relevant change. The dataset of distinct perturbations was obtained from the same individual and was treated as paired samples. To detect the main effect by experimental stimulus, we adopted Fisher's least significant difference procedure for paired samples (Friedman test and two\u2010sided Wilcoxon signed rank test as post\u2010hoc analysis). For comparison of VEGFA in between TIG\u20103 and CAF, two\u2010sided Mann\u2010Whitney U test was used. P values <0.01 were considered significant. To estimate the dependency between tumor location and VEGF\u2010A localization in CAF, we carried out chi\u2010squared test (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012) but the conclusion was questionable as a result of a limited number of specimens.RESULTSCancer\u2010associated fibroblasts showed large variations of gene expression, partly explained by tissue of originTo investigate the heterogeneity of CAF among colorectal, gastric and liver cancers, we measured mRNA expression of 18 marker genes and carried out Kruskal\u2010Wallis MANOVA (Table\u00a02). Main effect by tissue difference was considered significant for 11 genes: CXCL12, FN1, HGF, MMP9, PDGFA, POSTN, PTGES, S100A4, TNC, TNF and VIM (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01). Standard deviation of log2 expression was especially large for POSTN (2.865: \u00b1\u00a0sevenfold difference in linear scale), TNF (2.582: \u00b1\u00a0sixfold) and MMP9 (2.561: \u00b1\u00a0sixfold). Thus, variation of some marker genes was explained, in part, by the difference in tissue of origin.Kruskal\u2010Wallis multivariate analysis of varianceDependent variable\tKruskal\u2010Wallis H\tSignificance\t \tACTA2\t1.073\t0.554\t \tCXCL8\t5.020\t0.066\t \tCXCL12\t10.402\t0.009*\t \tFN1\t18.039\t0.000*\t \tHGF\t13.433\t0.002*\t \tIL6\t5.027\t0.077\t \tLOX\t6.021\t0.139\t \tMMP2\t3.412\t0.230\t \tMMP9\t11.110\t0.002*\t \tPDGFA\t36.027\t0.000*\t \tPOSTN\t20.315\t0.001*\t \tPTGES\t28.326\t0.000*\t \tS100A4\t20.007\t0.000*\t \tTGFB1\t5.345\t0.050\t \tTNC\t31.156\t0.000*\t \tTNF\t16.000\t0.000*\t \tVEGFA\t0.002\t0.997\t \tVIM\t9.109\t0.004*\t \tThree levels were defined as: cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts from colorectal, gastric or liver cancers (hepatocellular or cholangiocarcinoma) so that the degree of freedom is two.The null hypothesis was rejected (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, there exists main effect by a difference in tissue of origin).Cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts show large variations of gene expression, partly explained by tissue of origin. Kruskal\u2010Wallis multivariate analysis of variance detected the main effect by a difference in tissue of origin. Namely, inter\u2010tissue variations exist for 11 genes (see Table\u00a02). Nine representative genes are shown here. Scatterplots indicate log2 expression of designated genes. Error bars denote mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SDPerturbations in gene expression of CAFNext, we estimated the perturbations by measuring marker gene expression. Friedman test detected main effects of experimental stimulus in 13 out of 18 marker genes (Table\u00a03). As a post\u2010hoc analysis, two\u2010sided Wilcoxon signed rank test was carried out and 11 of 13 genes were significantly changed by the stimulus (Table\u00a04). Cisplatin significantly affected gene expression of ACTA2, CXCL8, CXCL12, LOX, PTGES and TGFB1 (Figure\u00a02A). Fluorouracil affected gene expression of ACTA2, CXCL12, HGF and VEGFA (Figure\u00a02B). CTOS affected gene expression of ACTA2, CXCL8, FN1, IL6, LOX, POSTN and VEGFA (Figure\u00a02C). Overall, degree of expression change was small, compared to large variation among the same level of stimulus (Figure\u00a02).Fisher's least significant difference procedure by Friedman test (n\u00a0=\u00a013)Dependent variable\tChi\u2010squared\tSignificance\t \tACTA2\t22.015\t0.000*\t \tCXCL8\t27\t0.000*\t \tCXCL12\t27.369\t0.000*\t \tFN1\t20.077\t0.000*\t \tHGF\t13.523\t0.004*\t \tIL6\t27.185\t0.000*\t \tLOX\t25.154\t0.000*\t \tMMP2\t3.738\t0.291\t \tMMP9\t5.585\t0.134\t \tPDGFA\t0.969\t0.809\t \tPOSTN\t15.277\t0.002*\t \tPTGES\t21.462\t0.000*\t \tS100A4\t11.215\t0.011\t \tTGFB1\t11.862\t0.008*\t \tTNC\t19.8\t0.000*\t \tTNF\t17.031\t0.001*\t \tVEGFA\t32.354\t0.000*\t \tVIM\t3.738\t0.291\t \tComparison between hypoxia and control was not included due to insufficient samples (n\u00a0=\u00a05).

Friedman and two\u2010sided Wilcoxon signed rank tests detected significant change in designated gene expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, see Tables\u00a03 and 4). Scatterplots indicate log2 expression. A, Expression change by cisplatin treatment (3.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for 3\u00a0d). B, Expression change by fluorouracil (5FU) treatment (312.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for 3\u00a0d). C, Expression change by coculture with cancer tissue\u2010originated spheroids (CTOS) (for 3\u00a0d). Asterisk denotes significant difference between control and the experimental stimulus (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, two\u2010sided Wilcoxon signed rank test)Paracrine signal from CTOS did not induce VEGFA in fetal lung fibroblastsAmong 11 genes described in Figure\u00a02, we particularly focused on VEGFA. We observed that hypoxia, fluorouracil exposure and coculture with CTOS remarkably upregulated VEGFA in CAF (Figure\u00a03A). As the putative function of the coculture is a paracrine signal through membrane pores (see Methods), we investigated whether such a paracrine signal could induce VEGFA in normal fibroblasts. When TIG\u20103 was cocultured with CTOS from various cancers (Table\u00a01), the change of VEGFA expression was not reproducible (Figure\u00a03B). Basal expression of VEGFA tended to be higher in CAF, compared to TIG\u20103 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.046 by Mann\u2010Whitney U test). Higher expression of VEGFA in CAF was further augmented by coculture with CTOS (Figure\u00a03B). Data indicated that CAF were competent to induce VEGFA in response to paracrine signal from CTOS, but fetal lung fibroblasts were not. In other words, the paracrine signal per\u00a0se was not sufficient to induce VEGFA.Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a gene for angiogenesis was induced by experimental stimulus in cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAF). Paracrine signal from cancer tissue\u2010originated spheroids (CTOS) was not sufficient for the induction in human fetal lung fibroblasts. A, VEGFA was induced either by hypoxia (1% O2 for 6\u00a0h), fluorouracil (5FU; 312.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL for 3\u00a0d) or coculture with CTOS (for 3\u00a0d). B, When human fetal lung fibroblasts (TIG\u20103) were cocultured with CTOS, the induction of VEGFA was not reproducible. Basal expression of VEGFA tended to be higher in CAF (compare the filled circles between TIG\u20103 and CAF: P\u00a0=\u00a00.046 by Mann\u2010Whitney U test) but the higher VEGFA in CAF was further augmented by coculture with CTOS. Asterisk denotes significant difference between control and the experimental stimulus (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, two\u2010sided Wilcoxon signed rank test)Vascular endothelial growth factor A protein was synthesized in CAF both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivoFinally, we confirmed whether protein synthesis of VEGF\u2010A was accompanied by mRNA induction. Consistent with mRNA induction, all the four perturbations increased VEGF\u2010A synthesis in cultured CAF (Figure\u00a04), whereas internal control GAPDH protein was largely unaffected (Figure\u00a04). In paraffin\u2010embedded tumor specimens, VEGF\u2010A protein was colocalized with \u03b1\u2010SMA (encoded by ACTA2 gene, a surrogate marker of fibroblast activation) protein (Figure\u00a05, ID16), suggesting that CAF synthesize VEGF\u2010A in pathological conditions. However, syntheses of VEGF\u2010A and \u03b1\u2010SMA was not overlapping in some patients (Figure\u00a05, ID13), presumably because other cell types (eg, smooth muscle cells surrounding venules) also synthesize \u03b1\u2010SMA. We observed that some \u03b1\u2010SMA\u2010negative cells also synthesized VEGF\u2010A protein (Figure\u00a05, ID11), indicating that CAF is not an exclusive cell type that induces angiogenesis in complex tumor microenvironments. When we compared the degree of colocalization among distinct tumor locations, some tendency existed in hepatocellular carcinomas, but not in liver metastasis (Table\u00a05).Protein synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF\u2010A) was induced by experimental stimulus in cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts. 30\u00a0\u03bcg (for VEGF\u2010A) or 10\u00a0\u03bcg (for GAPDH) of whole\u2010cell protein lysate was loaded per lane. Western blotting against VEGF\u2010A or GAPDH was carried out. GAPDH served as an internal control. 5FU, 5\u2010fluorouracilVascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF\u2010A) protein was occasionally synthesized in cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts in colorectal cancer specimens. Upper raw images: \u03b1\u2010smooth muscle actin (\u03b1\u2010SMA) protein is stained with green color in different tumor specimens. Middle raw images: VEGF\u2010A protein is stained with red color in different tumor specimens. Lower raw images: Fluorescent signals of three different colors are merged. Cellular nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue color). Note that the immunoreactivities of \u03b1\u2010SMA and VEGF\u2010A are moderately overlapping in patient ID16 (liver metastasis of rectal cancer, left column images), whereas such colocalization is mild in ID11 (colon cancer, middle column images). In ID13 (rectal cancer, right column images), venule\u2010like structures are stained with \u03b1\u2010SMA antibody without colocalization with VEGF\u2010A.

One is to confirm the heterogeneity of fibroblasts among a distinct tissue of origin.10 Indeed, several marker genes showed large variation in their expression level, which was explained, in part, by tissue of origin (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01).The other significance of analyzing the various CAF is to extrapolate the knowledge to distant stromal cells. When patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin or fluorouracil), the systemic stressor also influences stromal cells in distant organs. We defined clinically relevant environmental stimuli and estimated perturbations of CAF in gene expression. Among such perturbations, coculture with CTOS is especially important, as cancer cells secrete various cytokines and extracellular vehicles.13 In principle, the coculture experiments recapitulate the paracrine (but not the juxtaposed) interaction between cancer cells and CAF in tumors in\u00a0situ. However, if the paracrine signal spreads through the vasculature, the systemic signal could influence stromal cells of distant organs. Such \u201cremote control by primary tumor\u201d has been intensively studied and the stromal cells are considered to reorganize the tissue microenvironments as premetastatic niches.19, 20 In this respect, it is interesting that the coculture of CTOS remarkably induced VEGFA expression (Figure\u00a03A). Data raised another question of whether this signal similarly affects fibroblasts in distant organs. To address this hypothesis, we carried out replacement of fetal lung fibroblasts with CAF. Opposite to our prediction, coculture of CTOS failed to induce VEGFA in the lung fibroblasts (Figure\u00a03B). Tuveson and colleagues reported that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells induced CAF phenotype from pancreatic stellate cells.17 The discrepancy could be due to the difference in choice of materials (ie, fetal lung fibroblasts vs pancreatic stellate cells) or to the difference in incubation time (3 vs 10\u00a0days). From our data, we presume that patients\u2019 CAF had acquired a type of \u201ccompetence for VEGFA induction\u201d, which the lung fibroblasts do not have. CAF are known to resemble physiologically normal fibroblasts during tissue damage (termed as activated or primed) in terms of cytokine secretion and ECM remodeling.7 However, the secretory phenotype of CAF is augmented and irreversibly switched, compared to primed fibroblasts.7 Molecular identity for the paracrine signal competence remains unknown, but is an interesting theme for future study.From the clinical perspective, it is intriguing that fluorouracil induced VEGFA in CAF (Figure\u00a02B). Data suggest that fluorouracil potentially increases the risk of distant metastasis, although it is effective in decreasing tumor bulk. Indeed, in a mouse breast cancer model, fluorouracil enhances lung metastasis by activating infiltrating neutrophils.21 In contrast, bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody medication that inhibits VEGF\u2010A, one of the most potent angiogenesis ligands. Standard use of bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal carcinoma is combined with fluorouracil. It is tempting to speculate that the combination of fluorouracil and bevacizumab could effectively produce synergy by targeting disseminated cancer cells and CAF in distant organs. Thus, the outcome of chemotherapy could lead to undesirable consequences unless we understand the interplay of the tumor microenvironment (ie, cancer cells, CAF, macrophages, neutrophils etc.).Finally, collection of similar data is continuing and patient outcomes are being followed up. We noted that the perturbation was nearly consistent in coculture with CTOS, but not in cisplatin or fluorouracil exposure (ie, responder or non\u2010responder existed for each gene: Figure\u00a03). We carried out four\u2010way MANOVA to detect inter\u2010factor interaction between experimental stimulus and three other factors (tissue of origin, histology, TMN stage, Table\u00a01). However, we failed to detect interaction (data not shown), indicating that the \u201cresponder or non\u2010responder\u201d variations cannot be explained by known pathological factors. It is proposed that the drivers of cancer evolution are not genomic mutations, but intermittent changes of tissue microenvironments.22 Apart from the malignancy of cancer cells per\u00a0se, individual difference in tumor microenvironments could significantly influence disease prognosis.1, 2 Overall, prediction of behaviors of complex systems is difficult when more than three dynamic players interact with each other.23, 24 This could be the reason why most patients who receive genomic testing do not benefit from a genomic precision medicine strategy.9 As alternatives, genome biologists are proposing \u201cperturbation\u2010based monitoring of cellular responses\u201d for tackling the complexity inside cancer cells.9, 10 In the present study, we established perturbation\u2010based monitoring of patients\u2019 CAF as a surrogate indicator for response of distant stromal cells against environmental stimuli. Combined with a follow\u2010up study, we will identify critical marker genes to determine patient outcome.CONCLUSIONSWe established perturbation\u2010based monitoring of patients\u2019 CAF. VEGFA was reproducibly induced by experimental stimuli. Paracrine signal from CTOS was sufficient to induce VEGFA in CAF, but not in fetal lung fibroblasts. Further data collection and individual patient follow up is ongoing to identify critical determinants for disease outcome.DISCLOSUREConflicts of Interest: Authors declare no conflicts of interest for this article.REFERENCESAccessories to the crime: functions of cells recruited to the tumor microenvironmentMicroenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasisThe role of stroma in pancreatic cancer: diagnostic and therapeutic implicationsStromal gene expression defines poor\u2010prognosis subtypes in colorectal cancerVirtual microdissection identifies distinct tumor\u2010and stroma\u2010specific subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaThe prognostic landscape of genes and infiltrating immune cells across human cancersThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerAnatomic demarcation by positional variation in fibroblast gene expression programsFunctional precision cancer medicine\u2014moving beyond pure genomicsDrug resistance mechanisms in colorectal cancer dissected with cell type\u2010specific dynamic logic modelsAugmented pentose phosphate pathway plays critical roles in colorectal carcinomasExtracellular vesicles: biology and emerging therapeutic opportunitiesReceptor for advanced glycation endproducts signaling cascades are activated in pancreatic fibroblasts, but not in the INS1E insulinoma cell line: are mesenchymal cells major players in chronic inflammation?Dual pharmacological inhibition of glutathione and thioredoxin systems synergizes to kill colorectal carcinoma stem cellsCellular organization and molecular differentiation model of breast cancer\u2010associated fibroblastsDistinct populations of inflammatory fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in pancreatic cancerCutaneous wound healingThe tumour\u2010induced systemic environment as a critical regulator of cancer progression and metastasisPre\u2010metastatic niches: organ\u2010specific homes for metastasesInvolvement of prokineticin 2\u2010expressing neutrophil infiltration in 5\u2010fluorouracil\u2010induced aggravation of breast cancer metastasis to lungConnecting cancer to its causes requires incorporation of effects on tissue microenvironmentsCause and effect in biology"

        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

Although a few targeted therapies such as inhibitors of PARP or immune checkpoints are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Existing therapies for TNBC are largely ineffective due to drug resistance that eventually leads to relapse and metastasis within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Therefore, alternative treatment approaches are imperative to improve outcomes for TNBC patients. Recent evidence suggests that besides alterations in cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interactions with cancer cells (i.e., tumor-stromal interactions) promote drug resistance and disease progression. Using the TME as a therapy target has gained momentum particularly for aggressive cancers such as TNBC that have a rich stroma and limited targeted therapies.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant stromal cells in the TME of TNBC. CAFs secrete paracrine signaling molecules that interact with cancer cells and promote tumor growth, drug resistance, and eventually metastasis. Recognizing the role of stroma-derived paracrine factors in tumorigenesis, several drugs are in clinical trials to target either CAFs, its secreted factors, or their corresponding receptors expressed on cancer cells. Despite progress in understanding the TME, identifying effective drugs against tumor-stromal interactions remains difficult. Typically, animal models and cell cultures are used for both mechanistic studies and testing drugs in preclinical stages. Animal models lack most, if not all, of human stroma and are incompatible with screening multiple compounds and dosing regimens needed in drug discovery. Monolayer cell cultures allow high throughput compound screening but lack the native architecture and components of tumor stroma and poorly predict drug responses in vivo. To address this technological gap, three-dimensional (3D) tumor models have been developed to recreate tumor-stromal interactions, including co-culture spheroids of cancer-stromal cells with or without ECM and microfluidic devices with tumor and stromal compartments. These models either do not recreate the spatial distribution of different components of the TME or are incompatible with automated platforms for drug screening. Emerging organoid technologies partially address these shortcomings, with major caveats that include the long time needed to develop them and challenges to incorporate stromal cells.We recently developed a 3D organotypic TNBC model that contains key components of the breast TME, i.e., a mass of cancer cells, activated fibroblasts, and ECM, and is compatible with automated liquid handling operations. Here, we leveraged this model and established that CAFs and TNBC cells predominantly communicate via HGF-MET paracrine signaling, activating several oncogenic pathways while promoting invasiveness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells. We also found that HGF-MET signaling was highly active in a lung stromal environment and promoted colony formation by TNBC cells. We identified drug combinations that significantly blocked stroma-mediated tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells.Materials and MethodsCell cultureMDA-MB-231, SUM159, Hs 578T, MDA-MB-157, HCC1806, and BT-20 TNBC cells and WI-38 lung fibroblast cells were purchased from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells were transduced to stably express GFP. Three different breast fibroblast cells were used: normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein (gift of Dr. Daniel Hayes, University of Michigan), CAFs derived from a human breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-1) and obtained from Neuromics (Cat. No. CAF06), and CAFs derived from an invasive ductal breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-2) and obtained from BioIVT (Cat. No. HPCCAFBR-05). CAFs were cultured as recommended by the vendors for up to five passages. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, Hs 578T, and HMF cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). HCC1806 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma), 2 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic. WI-38 cells were cultured in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. Cells were plated in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and kept in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested frequently for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. No further authentication was performed for ATCC cell lines. After about 25 passages, the cells were replenished with fresh cultures from frozen stocks.Human phospho-RTK arrayA human phospho-RTK array (R&D Systems, Cat. No. ARY001B) was used to detect relative phosphorylation of 49 different RTKs on TNBC cells post-stimulation with conditioned media of CAF cells. TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) were stimulated for 10 min with conditioned media from confluent cultures of CAFs (CAF-1 and CAF-2). For a negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed using lysis buffer 17 containing protease inhibitors (Aprotinin, Leupeptin, and Pepstatin). Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each array was blocked for 1 h with array buffer 1 and incubated with 300 \u03bcg of protein lysate overnight at 4\u00b0C. The array was washed and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-phospho-tyrosine detection antibody and developed using FluorChem E imaging (ProteinSimple). The relative phosphorylation of each RTK in the blot array was quantified by measuring pixel densities of the corresponding pair of dots on the array in ImageJ and normalized with respect to its vehicle control.Bead-based multiplex immunoassayConditioned media from confluent monolayer cultures of HMF, CAF-1, CAF-2, and WI-38 cells were collected from an overnight incubation. Concentrations of secreted factors were quantified using a magnetic bead panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HAGP1MAG-12K) for HGF, FGF-1, FGF-2 and another panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HCYTA-60K) for EGF and PDGF-AB/BB. Briefly, each conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove debris. Then, the supernatant was incubated with the premixed antibody-immobilized beads overnight at 4\u00b0C on a titer plate shaker. The beads were washed carefully three times with a wash buffer using a handheld magnet (Millipore, Cat. No. 40-285) to retain the magnetic beads in the well plate. Next, the beads were incubated with a detection antibody followed by addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from the beads was measured using a Luminex MAGPIX instrument. Standard curves were generated to determine concentrations of the soluble factors.Organotypic tumor model and imaging of TNBC cell invasionThe organotypic tumor model was formed in two robotic micropatterning steps using an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) technology with 5.0%(w/v) polyethylene glycol and 6.4%(w/v) dextran. First, 7.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells were microprinted in a nanodrop to form a spheroid in each well of a 384-well plate. Then, a drop containing 20 \u03bcl ice-cold rat tail type I collagen solution (Corning) and 1.5\u00d7104 suspended fibroblasts was dispensed into each well. The 384-well plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to form the tumor model with fibroblasts dispersed in a collagen gel containing a mass of TNBC cells. For confocal imaging, the tumor models were formed in a glass bottom 384-well plate (MatTek, Cat. No. PBK384G). Images were captured with a 10X objective on days 1 and 5 of culture (Nikon A1). TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Z-projected images were constructed from images of samples acquired with a z-spacing of 20 \u03bcm. NIS software was used for image acquisition and Fiji (ImageJ, NIH) was used for image analysis and 3D reconstruction. The total pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with CAF-1 or CAF-2 was normalized to the pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with HMF. Unlabeled collagen fibers were imaged using confocal reflectance microscopy.Flow cytometryTo quantify the proliferation of TNBC cells in organotypic models 5 days after formation, the collagen matrix was digested using collagenase I (Sigma) and mechanical agitation for 15 min. Collagenase activity was neutralized by adding triple amounts of complete growth medium. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was suspended in 300 \u03bcl of medium and then 50 \u03bcl of suspension of counting beads (CountBright, Invitrogen) was added. Cells were analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. At least 103 counting bead events were acquired while running each sample. Non-fluorescing TNBC cells were used to remove the background fluorescence. The GFP+ TNBC cells were gated from unstained fibroblasts. The absolute TNBC cell number was obtained as (number of TNBC events/number of bead events) \u00d7 number of beads.Quantitative PCRCells were harvested from organotypic cultures and lysed using a Total RNA Kit lysis buffer (Omega BioTek). The lysate was passed through homogenizer mini columns (Omega BioTek). Total RNA was obtained using an RNA isolation kit (Omega BioTek). After removing DNA using RNase-free DNase (Omega BioTek), purity and concentration of isolated RNA were assessed using optical density (OD) 260/280 spectrophotometry (Synergy H1M, BioTek Instruments). cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using random hexamer primers (Roche). Real-time qPCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 instrument II using a SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche). After combining 50 ng of cDNA with the primer and the SYBR Green Master Mix to a final volume of 15 \u03bcl, the reactions were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification, that is, at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, at 60\u00b0C for 10 s, and at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The primer sequences for the genes are listed in Table S1. Gene expression values were calculated relative to \u03b2-actin and GAPDH using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. mRNA fold change was determined from the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.Western blottingOrganotypic cultures were treated with collagenase I for 15 min with added mechanical agitation. The collagenase activity was neutralized using triple amounts of complete growth media. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer containing 1% protease inhibitors and 1% phosphatase inhibitors. For stimulation experiments, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were stimulated for 10 min with CAF-1 and CAF-2 conditioned media with or without crizotinib (0.5 \u03bcM or 1 \u03bcM). For negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested using RIPA buffer. The cell suspension was further sonicated twice at a 20% amplitude for 5 sec (Vibra-Cell, Sonics). A BCA protein quantification assay was used to measure total protein concentration from each sample, which was then loaded onto a 4-15% gel (Bio-rad) for electrophoresis. Each gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk prepared in wash buffer for 1 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9101), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9102), phospho-Akt (Ser473, Cat. No. 4060), Akt (pan, Cat. No. 4691), phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705, Cat. No. 9145), Stat3 (Cat. No. 4904), E-Cadherin (Cat. No.14472), N-Cadherin (Cat. No. 13116), Vimentin (Cat. No. 5741), phospho-Met (Tr1234/1235, Cat. No. 3077), Met (Cat. No. 8198), and GAPDH (Cat. No. 5174), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The membranes were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection was done using ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) with FluorChem E system.Drug treatments of TNBC spheroidsInhibitors of MAPK (trametinib, ulixertinib, SCH772984) and PI3K/Akt (dactolisib, apitolisib, VS-5584) were purchased from Selleckchem. Dactolisib was dissolved in dimethylformamide and all other compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The compounds were used at 1\u00d710\u22124 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 5\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22122 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22121 \u03bcM, 1\u00d7100 \u03bcM, and 1\u00d7101 \u03bcM against free floating spheroids of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells. Untreated spheroids were kept in culture media. After 4 days of drug treatments, the GFP signal from TNBC cells was measured using a plate reader and the fluorescent signal was normalized to that from the vehicle control spheroids to construct dose\u2013response curves (GraphPad Prism) and calculate LD50 values.Cyclic treatment regimenTo model resistance of cancer cells to monotherapies, MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids at a 1:1 ratio were cyclically treated with 5 nM (i.e., 0.5\u00d7LD50) trametinib for 28 days. Each experiment included four cycles of treatment (T1, T2, T3, T4) each followed by a recovery phase (R1, R2, R3). Phase images were captured at the end of each cycle to approximate the volume of spheroids. The GFP signal from TNBC cells was normalized to that from day 0 to calculate a percent viability. A growth rate metric (kc), defined as the difference in the volumes of spheroids after and before each treatment divided by 4 days treatment, was used to quantify trametinib resistance.Combination treatments of organotypic culturesOrganotypic cultures were treated with crizotinib/trametinib or crizotinib/dactolisib combinations prepared in culture medium with 1% FBS. Each inhibitor was used at five concentrations, 0.1 \u2013 50 nM for trametinib and dactolisib, and 1 \u2013 5 \u03bcM for crizotinib, which were selected based on dose-responses of free-floating spheroids of the cells. Single-agent treatments with trametinib and dactolisib were also carried out, resulting in a 6\u00d76 matrix of concentration pairs, each with four replicates. Treatments were renewed after 72 h. Confocal images of the cultures were captured on day 5. The area occupied by TNBC cells was measured, normalized with the respective vehicle control, and represented as an invasion area to quantify the effect of each treatment. The fraction of cells affected by each treatment was calculated as 1-invasion area. A synergy analysis was performed to generate a combination index (CI) for pairs of drugs.Colony formation assay and immunofluorescence imaging of proliferative cellsTNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM159, Hs 578T), with or without WI-38 lung fibroblast cells, were seeded as a single cell suspension in a 1.2% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sigma) gel made using 1% FBS-containing medium. A 1:4 ratio of TNBC:WI-38 cells was used and each well of a 384-well plate contained 50 TNBC cells and 200 WI-38 cells. Culture medium with 1% FBS was replaced every 3 days. The cultures were treated with 0.5 \u03bcM crizotinib and maintained for 8-10 days to image the colonies. The TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM prior to imaging at a 2.5X magnification. An in-house python code in ImageJ was used to automatically detect the colonies in each image and compute their areas. A threshold colony diameter of 75 \u03bcm was used for statistical analysis. The TNBC colonies were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 3% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were incubated overnight with a Ki-67 rabbit antibody in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (Cell Signaling, Cat. No. 9027). Samples were washed and incubated with a rhodamine red donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100, Cat. No. 711-295-152) for 1h and imaged. Ki-67+ cells were counted per TNBC colony and Ki-67/colony area ratios were normalized to the average in the respective vehicle control group, i.e., TNBC cells without WI-38 cells and crizotinib treatment.Bioinformatics analysis of data from breast cancer patientsThe mRNA expression data from 2509 publicly available cases of invasive breast carcinoma were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, METABRIC dataset), using cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). A query was performed to analyze co-expression of EGFR and MET genes. Co-expression of EGFR and MET proteins was also analyzed using protein expression data from the Firehose legacy breast cancer dataset (TCGA). The activities of p-EGFR and p-MET were determined from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) available through MD Anderson Cancer Center.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene expression data of GSE138139 was downloaded from the GEO database. For GSEA, the number of permutations was set to 1,000. The platform of this dataset is the GPL1261 Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. The enrichment score was calculated according to metastasis status (lung metastasis versus parental breast cancer cells). Differences of a nominal p<0.05 and an FDR less than 25% defined significance.Statistical analysisData were first checked for normality using the Anderson-Darling method in MINITAB. For normally-distributed data, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparisons was used to compare means among three or more samples. A two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to compare two experimental groups. Normally-distributed data from experiments were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Non-Gaussian distributed data were analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Values of p<0.05 denoted statistical significance.Data availabilityThe data generated in this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Data file.

While both TNBC cells had high basal EGFR activity, stimulation with CAFs significantly activated MET. CAF-1 led to 25 and 30-fold increase in pMET levels and marginally affected pEGFR by 0.7 and 1.5-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively (Fig. 1b). CAF-2 also increased pMET by 3.7 and 5.5-fold and minimally changed pEGFR by 0.8 and 1.3-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively. Thus, CAFs predominantly activated MET in TNBC cells. To further validate this finding, we treated six different TNBC cells with conditioned media from the CAFs and found significant activation of MET in all six TNBC cells by CAF-1 and in five of the TNBC cells by CAF-2 (Fig. 1c\u2013d). Despite MET protein expression in the TNBC cells (i.e., high t-MET levels), paracrine signaling with CAFs activated it (i.e., p-MET) (Fig. 1c). We ensured that MET activation was indeed due to paracrine signaling with CAFs using an immunoassay that showed both CAFs secrete high levels of the MET ligand, HGF, i.e., ~10.2 ng/ml by CAF-1 and ~1 ng/ml by CAF-2 (Fig. 1e). In contrast, HMFs secreted only 50 pg/ml of HGF. Other soluble factors such as EGF, FGF-1 and FGF-2, and PDGF AA/AB were not detectable. Taken together, these results indicate that CAFs from patients secrete HGF and predominantly activate MET in TNBC cells.CAFs activate multiple oncogenic pathways in TNBC cellsActive RTKs regulate various signaling pathways that drive breast cancer progression. We evaluated activities of several prominent pathways in breast cancers including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT. While MDA-MB-231 cells had basal MAPK/ERK activity due to an activating mutation in K-Ras, CAF-1 led to activation of both Akt and STAT3, whereas CAF-2 only activated Akt (Fig. 2a). In SUM159 cells that had basal PI3K/Akt pathway activity due to a mutation in PI3K, both CAFs activated ERK and STAT3 signaling (Fig. 2a). CAF-1 had a greater effect in activation of these pathways than CAF-2 because of its higher HGF production that led to significantly higher MET activation in TNBC cells (Fig. 1c\u2013d). To validate the role of HGF-MET signaling in activating these pathways, we used a MET inhibitor, crizotinib, against TNBC cells stimulated with CAF-1. We selected only CAF-1 for this experiment because of its greater effect on promoting oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells. This treatment led to a dose-dependent significant reduction in activation of ERK, Akt, and STAT3 in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Fig. 2b). Overall, these results established that CAFs promote several downstream pathways in TNBC cells through HGF-MET signaling.MET expression and activity in patient tumorsTo determine the clinical relevance of MET in TNBC, we analyzed MET gene expression in different breast cancer subtypes in TCGA. Basal and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, which primarily represent TNBC, showed significantly higher expression of MET than other subtypes (Fig. 3a). We also found a moderate, but significant correlation between MET and EGFR at both gene and protein levels (Fig. 3b). To determine functional activities of MET and EGFR in breast tumors, we analyzed data for invasive breast carcinomas and found a significant correlation between p-MET and p-EGFR (Fig. 3c). This analysis of data from patient tumors underlines the significance of MET activity in TNBC, and together with our results, suggests a critical role for CAFs to predominantly activate MET in EGFR+ TNBC cells.CAFs promote pro-metastatic functions in TNBC cellsOur organotypic tumor 3D model mimics the architecture and positioning of cancer and stromal cells in solid tumors. The model has a matrix stiffness of ~2.5 kPa as in human breast tumors (Fig. 4a). Using this model, we studied the role of CAFs on matrix invasion of TNBC cells. We found that unlike HMF cells, CAF-1 and CAF-2 promoted ECM invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells by up to ~2.5-fold (Fig. 4b\u2013c). Furthermore, our analysis of organotypic models showed that both CAFs promoted proliferation of the TNBC cells by up to ~1.3-fold within 5 days (Fig. 4d\u2013e).Due to the role of EMT in local invasion of cancer cells and metastasis, we investigated whether CAFs promote an EMT phenotype in TNBC cells. Invading TNBC cells in organotypic models containing CAF-1 or CAF-2 displayed a significantly more elongated morphology compared to those with HMF cells (Fig. 5a). To validate this result, we quantified gene expression of several EMT transcription factors. Co-cultures with CAF-1 and CAF-2 upregulated most EMT markers in TNBC cells (Fig. 5b). CAF-1 enhanced expression of SLUG and FOXC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL and ZEB2 in SUM159 cells by more than 3-fold. CAF-2 also increased expression of SLUG and FOXC2 by nearly or more than 2-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL in SUM159 cells by over 2-fold. We further validated these results and showed that stimulation with CAF-1 conditioned medium led to elevation of vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and N-cadherin in SUM159 cells (Fig. 5c). CAF-2 cells did not induce a detectable change in these proteins in the TNBC cells. Overall, these results indicate that CAFs shift these mesenchymal-like TNBC cells further toward a mesenchymal phenotype.Modeling resistance of TNBC cells to single-agent treatmentsFrequent emergence of drug resistance to monotherapies in solid tumors typically necessitates combination therapies to increase treatment efficacy and durability. Next, we asked to what extent single-agent targeting of constitutively-active oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells would lead to drug resistance and a potential function of HGF-cMET signaling in drug resistance. To select drug compounds for these experiments, we used TNBC spheroids and performed a dose-dependent screening of a set of molecular inhibitors against MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. S2). Our quantitative analysis showed that the most effective inhibitors were trametinib against MDA-MB-231 cells with an LD50 of 10 nM and dactolisib against SUM159 cells with an LD50 of 1 \u03bcM. Then, we treated MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids with trametinib in a cyclic regimen to mimic intermittent chemotherapy cycles (Fig. 6a). Trametinib reduced the size of spheroids during the first two treatment rounds (T1 and T2) (Fig. 6b) and reduced cancer cell viability to 41% at the end of T2 (Fig. 6c). However, after the second recovery round (R2), trametinib became significantly less effective. At the end of the 28-day regimen, spheroids treated with trametinib were 3.04-fold larger than those after T1 and the GFP fluorescence intensity of the MDA-MB-231 cells, i.e., an approximate measure of number of cells, increased by 3.11-fold compared to that after T1. We used a growth rate metric (kc) to quantify the treatment effect (Fig. 6d). Although kc for the spheroids reduced during T1 and T2, it significantly increased during T3 and T4. The kc values of spheroids from T1 to T4 increased from \u22120.0059 mm3/day to 0.0172 mm3/day. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we evaluated activation of ERK, Akt, and MET following T1 and T3 treatments (Fig. 6e). Trametinib treatment reduced pERK and pMET levels but upregulated pAKT during T1. Following T3, there was significant activation of ERK and MET and persistent activity of Akt. These findings suggest feedback signaling between PI3K/Akt and MAPK/MEK pathways and gain of MET activity to drive ERK signaling as potential mechanisms of trametinib resistance of TNBC cells.Combination treatments to suppress tumorigenic activities of TNBC cellsNext, we evaluated the feasibility of a combination treatment strategy to simultaneously suppress proliferation, invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in organotypic cultures. Because HGF from CAFs activated MET in TNBC cells, we hypothesized that treatments blocking the HGF-MET axis and its downstream pathways could potentially inhibit tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells. To test this hypothesis, we selected a combination of inhibitors of MET and MAPK pathway for MDA-MB-231 cells and MET and PI3K/Akt pathway for SUM159 cells and performed matrix-style combination treatments. This selection reflects different constitutively active kinase pathways in the TNBC cells, i.e., MAPK pathway in MDA-MB-231 and PI3K/Akt pathway in SUM159 cells (Fig. 2a). We used CAF-1 for these experiments because it had a greater effect on promoting invasion, proliferation, EMT, and oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells than CAF-2.Representative images of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells in organotypic cultures under single-agent and combination treatments and the quantified inhibition of invasion are shown in Fig. 7a\u2013d. While each compound alone reduced cancer cell invasion, the combination treatments more effectively inhibited invasion at low concentrations. With the organotypic cultures of MDA-MB-231, trametinib/crizotinib up to and including the 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair showed significantly greater effects than the individual drugs. The 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair synergistically reduced cell invasion by 93% and resulted in CI=0.34. With the organotypic cultures of SUM159, crizotinib/dactolisib up to and including the 1 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM pair were more effective than each compound alone with the combination blocking SUM159 cell invasion by up to 96% with a CI = 0.39. Although the drug combinations also reduced MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cell proliferation in organotypic models by 1.76-fold and 2.0-fold (Fig 7e\u2013f), respectively, results suggest that TNBC proliferation was primarily driven by the constitutive pathway in each TNBC cell line because reduction in proliferation was mainly realized using the respective inhibitor of each pathway rather than crizotinib.Next, we studied inhibitory effects of the treatments on downstream signaling pathways. The crizotinib/trametinib pair downregulated activities of MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly greater than those from the respective responses when each compound was used alone (Fig. 7g). Additionally, it significantly reduced expression of various EMT gene and protein markers (Fig. 7h\u2013i). With SUM159 organotypic cultures, the dactolisib/crizotinib pair also significantly reduced activities of the three signaling pathways (Fig. 7j) and EMT markers (Fig. 7k\u2013l). Overall, these results provide compelling evidence that the selected combinations treatments effectively block CAFs-mediated pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells by simultaneously blocking signaling activities in multiple prominent oncogenic pathways.HGF-MET pathway promotes TNBC survival and colony formation in lung stromaDue to the prevalence of TNBC metastasis to lung, we asked whether HGF-MET pathway has a role in supporting TNBC cell survival and colony formation in the lung. We used a Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection and derived 14 MET signature genes based on their association with activated MET. Our analysis of results from a study of a murine metastasis model of human TNBC showed that these genes were significantly enriched in lung metastasis (Fig. S3a). This was consistent with other studies that showed lung stromal cells secrete high levels of HGF. To investigate functional effects of HGF-MET signaling in lung stroma, we used WI-38 lung fibroblast cells to determine to what extent they impact colony formation of TNBC cells. First, we validated that WI-38 cells activate MET receptors in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells (Fig. S3b). We ensured the specificity of this activity by analyzing the secretome of WI-38 cells and found that these cells secrete ~7.2 ng/ml of HGF (Fig. S3c).To study the role of lung fibroblasts in survival and proliferation of TNBC cells, we developed a 3D lung stromal environment consisting of a methylcellulose hydrogel and dispersed WI-38 cells. The hydrogel also contained single TNBC cells to represent metastatic cells. We used four different TNBC cell lines at a 1:4 ratio to WI-38 cells to mimic the relatively small population of cancer cells compared to the resident stromal cells in metastatic sites. Results showed that WI-38 cells significantly promote colony formation of SUM159, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-157 cells by 1.61, 4.0, and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig. S3d). We validated that this response was indeed due to the HGF-MET pathway by showing that crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of all three TNBC cells (Fig. S3d). Immunofluorescent staining of the cultures also showed a significant increase in Ki-67+ TNBC cells, which was reversed by blocking the HGF-MET axis (Fig. S3e). We note that WI-38 cells did not increase colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with a study that showed formation of MDA-MB-231 lung micrometastases significantly larger than our selected threshold to quantify colonies requires a much longer time than we used. Collectively, these results demonstrate that lung fibroblasts provide a permissive niche for survival and metastatic colonization of TNBC cells via the HGF-MET axis and suggest that blocking this pathway may provide benefits against both primary TNBC and lung metastasis.DiscussionTNBC is a heterogeneous disease that presents six different subtypes with significant activities of RTKs and downstream Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Although PARP and immune checkpoint inhibitors are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay treatment. Thus, disrupting tumor-stromal interactions may provide new targeted therapies for TNBC. We developed an organotypic tumor model to mechanistically study interactions of TNBC cells with patient-derived CAFs. Patient-derived CAFs predominantly secreted HGF, consistent with studies that showed CAFs in breast tumors produce as high as 50 ng/ml of HGF. However, CAFs from different patients showed a significant difference in HGF production due to inter-tumoral heterogeneity that is a characteristic of CAFs in breast tumors (Fig. S4). Although several reports have shown that breast cancer cells can produce HGF to activate MET in an autocrine signaling manner, we did not detect HGF in supernatants of TNBC cells. Furthermore, all six TNBC cell lines used had endogenous MET expression, in agreement with data from human breast tumors showing significantly higher MET gene expression in basal and claudin-low subtypes compared to other breast cancers (Fig. 3). Other studies have shown that MET is frequently overexpressed in malignant breast tissues and TNBC tumors, and its expression is a strong independent marker for poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. Consistent with the role of stroma in breast tumorigenicity, CAFs from patients significantly promoted proliferation, matrix invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in our organotypic tumor model. Our analysis of RTK activities of TNBC cells showed high basal activation of EGFR, consistent with EGFR overexpression in up to 78% of TNBC tumors. But in the presence of CAFs, the HGF-MET axis was the dominant oncogenic signaling pathway. This finding highlights a potential reason for the failure of anti-EGFR monotherapies in TNBC, consistent with our results that showed EGFR inhibitors were not effective against TNBC cell invasiveness (Fig. S5a) or CAFs-mediated MET activation (Fig. S5b). However, crizotinib alone significantly reduced matrix invasion and EGFR activity of TNBC cells (Fig. S5a). These results emphasize limitations of targeting only genetic aberrations of cancer cells and the importance of tumor-stromal interactions as a therapeutic target in TNBC. Using a defined matrix in our model is a major advantage to capture effects of specific CAFs-TNBC signaling without additional stimulatory and inhibitory factors present in animal-derived matrices such as Matrigel. Selecting human collagen for our model was guided by previous finding that TNBC has a significant enrichment for collagen deposition compared with the luminal subtypes.Leveraging our 3D organotypic model that allows mechanistic studies to guide treatments, we investigated both single-agent and combination treatments against HGF-MET and its downstream pathways. As expected, single-agent inhibition of the MAPK pathway in a long-term, cyclic treatment regimen led to resistance of TNBC cells. Consistent with our finding, prior studies have shown feedback activation of oncogenic kinase pathways as a major resistance mechanism. To simultaneously suppress matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells, we designed combination treatments against both TNBC-CAFs interactions and basal active signaling in TNBC cells, i.e., crizotinib/trametinib for MDA-MB-231 cells and crizotinib/dactolisib for SUM159 cells. This strategy was critical because targeting only the TNBC-CAFs interaction or the TNBC cells proved insufficient. For example, using a MAPK inhibitor (trametinib) alone against MDA-MB-231 cells led to drug resistance (Fig. 6), whereas targeting only the CAFs-mediated MET activation using crizotinib alone reduced but did not block activities of signaling proteins in TNBC cells (Fig. 7). We note that crizotinib alone was very effective in downregulating oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells with a brief 10 min treatment, but this was reversed over a 5-day treatment, indicating that TNBC cells become resistant to monotherapy with crizotinib as well. The combination treatment successfully blocked activities of these pathways. In addition to the role of HGF-MET in primary tumor progression, this signaling promoted colony forming capability of TNBC cells in a lung stromal environment, consistent with the role of lung stromal cells in promoting metastatic colonization of cancer cells. Other studies showed that HGF significantly increased lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in mouse models. Interestingly, disrupting HGF-MET using crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of TNBC cells in our model of lung stroma, suggesting that this pathway has therapeutic value against TNBC metastases formation in the lungs.In conclusion, we developed an organotypic 3D tumor model and demonstrated that interactions between TNBC cells and patient-derived CAFs occur predominantly through HGF-MET axis. This tumor-stromal signaling activated several oncogenic pathways and promoted pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells and colony formation in the lung stroma. We developed a design-driven approach and showed the feasibility of targeting tumor-stromal interactions using specific drug combinations to significantly inhibit matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells in a primary tumor environment and their metastatic colonization in a lung stromal environment. Our engineered tumor model is conducive to phenotypic and mechanistic studies to identify new therapeutic opportunities against tumor-stromal interactions and develop and screen the effectiveness of various treatment combinations and regimens. We also note that CAFs also degrade and deposit ECM and change its mechanical properties. Investigating integrated effects of biochemical and mechanical inputs to facilitate cancer cell invasiveness can inform targeting of tumor-stromal interactions.Supplementary MaterialDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest: Authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesPrognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancerTargeted Therapies for Triple-Negative Breast CancerComprehensive Profiling of Poor-Risk Paired Primary and Recurrent Triple-Negative Breast Cancers Reveals Immune Phenotype ShiftsRisk of regional recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer patients: a Dutch cohort studyInfluence of tumour micro-environment heterogeneity on therapeutic responseThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerTumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretionA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsThe updated landscape of tumor microenvironment and drug repurposingModeling and predicting clinical efficacy for drugs targeting the tumor milieuThree-dimensional tumor model mimics stromal - breast cancer cells signalingA Human Organotypic Microfluidic Tumor Model Permits Investigation of the Interplay between Patient-Derived Fibroblasts and Breast Cancer CellsThree-dimensional models of breast cancer-fibroblasts interactionsA Living Biobank of Breast Cancer Organoids Captures Disease HeterogeneityOrganotypic breast tumor model elucidates dynamic remodeling of tumor microenvironmentMicrofluidic Endothelium for Studying the Intravascular Adhesion of Metastatic Breast Cancer CellsHigh Throughput, Polymeric Aqueous Two-Phase Printing of Tumor SpheroidsNanolitre liquid patterning in aqueous environments for spatially defined reagent delivery to mammalian cellsMicroprinted Stem Cell Niches Reveal Compounding Effect of Colony Size on Stromal Cells-Mediated Neural DifferentiationCyclical Treatment of Colorectal Tumor Spheroids Induces Resistance to MEK InhibitorsSynergistic Inhibition of Kinase Pathways Overcomes Resistance of Colorectal Cancer Spheroids to Cyclic Targeted TherapiesThe somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refine their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes (vol 7, 11479, 2016)TCPA: a resource for cancer functional proteomics dataPhytochemicals inhibit migration of triple negative breast cancer cells by targeting kinase signalingEpigenetic regulation of RTK signalingPhosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase or RAS pathway mutations in human breast cancer cell linesThe nanomechanical signature of breast cancerEMT, MET, Plasticity, and Tumor MetastasisRational Approaches for Combination Therapy Strategies Targeting the MAP Kinase Pathway in Solid TumorsThe Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark Gene Set CollectionHepatocyte growth factor produced in lung fibroblasts enhances non-small cell lung cancer cell survival and tumor progressionMetastasis-initiating cells induce and exploit a fibroblast niche to fuel malignant colonization of the lungsThe Proteomic Landscape of Triple-Negative Breast CancerIdentification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapiesBreast Cancer Cells Induce Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts to Secrete Hepatocyte Growth Factor to Enhance Breast TumorigenesisSingle-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in CancerCancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity in axillary lymph nodes drives metastases in breast cancer through complementary mechanismsCoexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and receptor (Met) in human breast carcinomaMet induces diverse mammary carcinomas in mice and is associated with human basal breast cancerExpression of scatter factor and c-met receptor in benign and malignant breast tissueExpression of c-met is a strong independent prognostic factor in breast carcinomaMet induces mammary tumors with diverse histologies and is associated with poor outcome and human basal breast cancerChemokines released by breast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in MCF7 breast cancer cellsMolecular characterization of EGFR and EGFR-downstream pathways in triple negative breast carcinomas with basal like featuresThe paradoxical functions of EGFR during breast cancer progressionHuman breast cancer invasion and aggression correlates with ECM stiffening and immune cell infiltrationMesenchymal Cancer Cell-Stroma Crosstalk Promotes Niche Activation, Epithelial Reversion, and Metastatic ColonizationTargeted expression of HGF/SF in mouse mammary epithelium leads to metastatic adenosquamous carcinomas through the activation of multiple signal transduction pathwaysApigenin inhibits HGF-promoted invasive growth and metastasis involving blocking PI3K/Akt pathway and beta 4 integrin function in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cellsCAFs interact with TNBC cells predominantly through the HGF-MET pathway.

Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2).

First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. \u2227In panel 5B1, this value was significant in 2 out of 3 experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.To follow up on the data of Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their targets - CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 - were significantly lower in luminal-A patients than in basal patients, we determined how these three chemokines are affected by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of luminal-A:MSC co-cultures. Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with T47D cells and MSCs.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells. Studies of endothelial cell (HPMEC) migration in response to CM derived from different cell combinations of MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) (A) and MCF-7 cells (B). (A1, B1) Representative photos of HPMEC migration in response to TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10 ng/ml), from tumor cells alone, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 alone and from tumor cells grown under \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs only.

Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

Migration assays were performed in response to medium containing 10% FBS, for 12 h. ***p < 0.001, ns=non-significant for differences between migration of tumor cells in different combinations, compared to the migration of non-stimulated TNBC cells. \u2227In panel (A2), this value was significant in 1 out of 3 experiments.

In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

[\u2227Note: Possibly due to technical reasons (different matrigel batches) TNF\u03b1 stimulation elevated tumor cell invasion in this setting but not in Figure 10]. (A1) Representative photos.

Instead, two representative photos out of many taken in n > 3 independent experiments, are provided for each treatment.

To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL.

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-\u03b2) and its cognate receptor IL1R1 contribute to the initiation and progression of breast cancer determining pro-tumorigenic inflammatory responses. The transcriptional target of the hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) namely the G protein estrogen receptor (GPER) mediates a feedforward loop coupling IL-1\u03b2 induction by breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to IL1R1 expression by breast cancer cells toward the regulation of target genes and relevant biological responses.

Hence, our findings provide novel evidence regarding the mechanisms through which the hypoxic tumor microenvironment may contribute to breast cancer progression and suggest further targets useful in more comprehensive therapeutic strategies.BackgroundThe triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 10\u201320% of all breast malignancies, is characterized by the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) without the amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC displays a high heterogeneity, aggressive features and poor overall survival rates. Targeted therapeutics for TNBC are currently limited and the chemotherapy still remains the mainstay of treatment, though the patients frequently develop resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel targeted therapies is an imperative challenge to substantially improve the outcome of the TNBC patients. In this context, hypoxia and related effectors, as the hypoxia-inducible factors, have been suggested as important hallmarks of TNBC. To date, hypoxia that represents one of the most common conditions encountered within the breast cancer microenvironment, has been associated with tumor progression, increased risk of metastasis and mortality. Malignant cells may adapt to hypoxia mainly through the action of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which has been largely involved in tumor growth and vascularization, stromal cell recruitment, extracellular matrix remodeling, premetastatic niche formation, invasion and metastasis. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that an elevated expression of HIF-1\u03b1 has been associated with the aggressiveness of breast cancer and poor clinical outcomes. Likewise, the over-expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the consequent hyperactivation of its target genes have been indicated as key drivers in the TNBC.Numerous transduction pathways, including the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are engaged by the hypoxia-mediated activation of the HIF-1\u03b1 signaling. In this regard, our previous studies have demonstrated that upon hypoxia and other stimulatory factors, the G protein estrogen receptor, namely GPER, may contribute to the action of HIF-1\u03b1 toward breast tumor growth and angiogenesis. For instance, HIF-1\u03b1 was shown to be required for the up-regulation of GPER by hypoxia and both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER triggered the up-regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in breast cancer cells and main components of the tumor microenvironment, as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).The breast cancer microenvironment is characterized by an intricate functional interplay among epithelial cancer cells, the surrounding non-cancerous stromal cells (i.e. CAFs, adipocytes, endothelial, mesenchymal, innate and adaptive immune cells) and non-cellular components (i.e. blood and lymphatic vessels, extracellular matrix components). For instance, the bi-directional and intimate communication of cancer cells with CAFs has been reported to contribute to worse outcomes. In this vein, it is well acknowledged that cancer cells through various factors educate fibroblasts toward their pro-tumorigenic changes, which then characterize the stimulatory action of CAFs. Indeed, CAFs sustain the malignant properties of cancer cells synthesizing diverse extracellular matrix components (ECM), cytokines and growth factors, which in turn contribute to the metastatic cancer progression. In this scenario, the dynamic network occurring between cancer cells and CAFs relies on the production of many effectors, as diverse chemokines exerting tumor-promoting effects.The interleukin-1 (IL-1) family consists of several agonists, including IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and three receptor antagonists including the specific receptor antagonist IL1R1a. The IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) family is instead composed of more than 10 members, including the two main receptors namely IL-1 receptor type I (IL1R1) and the decoy receptor IL-1R type II. As it concerns IL-1\u03b2, its involvement in metastatic and angiogenic pathways toward breast cancer progression has been reported. In this regard, our and other previous studies have demonstrated that an estrogen-induced feedforward loop couples the IL-1\u03b2 induction in CAFs to the IL1R1-stimulatory action elicited in breast cancer cells. Likewise, high IL1\u03b2 levels within the breast tumor microenvironment have been associated with a high tumor grade and an invasive cancer phenotype.In the framework of the aforementioned data, here we first show that a positive correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression occurs in large cohorts of TNBC patients, as ascertained by querying public datasets. Thereafter, we provide novel mechanistic evidence on the hypoxia-prompted liaison between the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER signaling and the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis, toward a metastatic gene expression profile of TNBC cells and the engagement of CAFs in facilitating invasive cancer features.MethodsPublicly available molecular datasetsGene expression analysis was performed using the publically available The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets. Data was downloaded on the 10 May 2020. The patients clinical information along with the mRNA expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) reported in the Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of the TCGA project were downloaded from UCSC Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/). The clinical information and the microarray gene expression data (Log2 transformed intensity values) of the METABRIC cohort (n. 2509) were retrieved from cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org/). Samples of the TCGA cohort (n. 1247) were filtered by the \u201csample type\u201d in order to obtain exclusively the tumor tissues (n. 1101). Thereafter, patients of both TCGA and METABRIC were classified on the basis of the presence or the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), detected by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and clinical information were also filtered for missing values. The final filtering resulted in 771 patients of TCGA and 1904 patients of METABRIC.Correlation and pathway enrichment analysisThe Pearson correlation coefficients (r-values) between the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and the other genes of the TCGA (n. 20,530) dataset in TNBC cohort of patients were assessed in R Studio (version 3.6.1) using the cor.test() function and setting the method as \u201cPearson\u201d. The statistical analysis was performed by using the t-tests considering significant the coefficients obtained with p\u2009<\u20090.001. The first 250 most correlated genes were selected for the next evaluations. In particular, aiming to cluster these genes in pathways, we uploaded our list on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation analysis website (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). We analyzed the genes selecting the functional annotation tool and the option Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, choosing the official gene symbol as \u201cselect identifier\u201d and gene list as \u201clist type\u201d in the options of the upload and selecting a limit species of \u201cHomo sapiens\u201d in the background.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the gsea() function of the phenoTest package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/phenoTest.html) in R Studio. The KEGG \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway (KEGG entry\u2009=\u2009hsa04060) and \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d pathway (KEGG entry\u2009=\u2009hsa04066) were selected as the reference gene sets. We ranked the genes of the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway in accordance with the differential expression within HIF-1\u03b1 high and low (median expression value as threshold assessment) samples, and the \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d pathway genes in accordance with the differential expression within IL-1\u03b2 high and low (median expression value as threshold assessment) samples. Both analysis were performed only in the TNBC subgroup of patients, verifying if the selected sets of genes were enriched at the bottom or the top of the ranked lists. We calculated the enrichment score (ES) that reflects the degree to which a set of genes is overrepresented at the extremes (top or bottom) of the entire ranked list. The score was calculated by walking down a list of genes ranked by their correlation with the selected phenotype (high or low HIF-1\u03b1/ IL-1\u03b2 levels), increasing a running-sum statistic when a gene in that gene set is encountered (each vertical line underneath the enrichment plot) and decreasing it when a gene that isn\u2019t in the gene set is encountered. The magnitude of the increment depends on the correlation of one gene with the phenotype. In this analysis, 20,000 simulations were used (B\u2009=\u200920,000). p\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered significant.ReagentsThe ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) (used at a 300\u2009\u03bcM concentration) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (used at a 10\u2009\u03bcM concentration) were purchased from Merck Life Science (Milan, Italy). PD98059 (PD) and LY294,002 (LY) (both used at a 1\u2009\u03bcM concentration) were obtained from Calbiochem (Milan, Italy). All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, except NAC that was solubilized in water. Recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (used at a 10\u2009ng/mL concentration) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Life Technologies Italia, Monza, Italy) and solubilized in PBS with 1% BSA. The IL1R1 antagonist (IL1R1a) human recombinant protein (used at a 50\u2009ng/mL concentration) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and solubilized in 20\u2009mM TBS, pH\u20098, with 50% glycerol. Anti-IL-1\u03b2 neutralizing antibody (MAB601) was purchased from R&D Systems (Bio-Techne, Milano, Italy).Cell culturesThe TNBC MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells were provided by ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), used less than 6\u2009months after resuscitation, routinely tested and authenticated according to the ATCC suggestions. MDA-MB 231 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) with phenol red, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CAFs were isolated, cultured and characterized as previously described from 10 invasive mammary ductal carcinomas and pooled for the subsequent studies. Briefly, specimens were cut into 1\u20132\u2009mm diameter pieces, placed in a digestion solution (400\u2009IU collagenase, 100\u2009IU hyaluronidase, 10% FBS, antibiotics and antimycotics) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90\u00d7g for 2\u2009min. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485\u00d7g for 8\u2009min, the pellet obtained was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham\u2019s F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cultured at 37\u2009\u00b0C, 5% CO2. CAFs were then expanded into 10-cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for three population doublings within total 7 to 10\u2009days after tis-sue dissociation. Primary cell cultures of fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence with human anti-vimentin (V9; 1:500) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy; 1:250). FAP\u03b1 antibody (H-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy; 1:500) was used to assess fibroblast activation (data not shown). We used CAFs passaged for up to 10 population doublings for the experiments, to minimize clonal selection and culture stress, which could occur during extended tissue culture. All cell lines were grown in a 37\u2009\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and switched to medium without serum and phenol red the day before treatments to be processed for immunoblot and RT-PCR assays.Gene expression studies and PCR arraysTotal RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described. The expression of selected genes was quantified by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and are as follows: 5\u2032-ACCTATGACCTGCTTGGTGC-3\u2032 (HIF-1\u03b1 forward) and 5\u2032-GGCTGTGTCGACTGAGGAAA-3\u2032 (HIF-1\u03b1 reverse); 5\u2032-TTAAAGCCCGCCTGACAGA-3\u2032 (IL-1\u03b2 forward) and 5\u2032-GCGAATGACAGAGGGTTTCTTAG-3\u2032 (IL-1\u03b2 reverse); 5\u2032-TTACAGAGGGAAAACGACACCT-3\u2032 (GPER forward) and 5\u2032-GTGGGTCTTCCTCAGAAGGG-3\u2032 (GPER reverse); 5\u2032-AGTCCCTGAGCATCTACGGT-3\u2032 (COX2 forward) and 5\u2032-CATCATCAGACCAGGCACCA-3\u2032 (COX2 reverse); 5\u2032-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA-3\u2032 (ACTB forward) and 5\u2032-CACCTCCCCTGTGTGGACTT-3\u2032 (ACTB reverse). Assays were performed in triplicate and the results were normalized for actin beta (ACTB) expression and then calculated as fold induction of RNA expression.PCR arrays were performed using a TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The amplification reaction and the results analysis were carried out using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Gene silencing experiments and plasmidsCells were transfected using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Merck Life Science) for 24\u2009h before treatments with a control vector and a specific shRNA sequence or antisense vector for each target gene. The short hairpin (sh) RNA constructs to knock down the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and the control shRNA construct were purchased form SABioscience Corporation. Antisense vector for GPER (AsGPER), which was generated by cloning of the entire open reading frame of the receptor cDNA in the reverse orientation in pcDNA3.1 Hygro (\u2212), was a kind gift from Eric R Prossnitz (University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, USA). The plasmid DN/c-fos, which encodes for c-fos mutant that heterodimerizes with c-fos dimerization partners but does not allow DNA binding, was a kind gift from Dr. C. Vinson (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assayCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h, and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Merck Life Science) and immunoprecipitated with anti-HIF-1\u03b1 or anti-GPER antibody or nonspecific IgG. Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer consisting of 1%SDS and 0.1\u2009mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR. The primers used to amplify a region containing a HRE site located into the GPER promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-TGCAGCACTTCAAAACAATAACC \u2212\u20093\u2032 (Fw) and 5\u2032-GGGTTTGAGTTGTTTTTCCTTTGG-3\u2032 (Rv); the primers used to amplify a region containing a HRE site located into the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-ACAGACAGGGAGGGCTATTG-3\u2032 (Fw) and 5\u2032-GGGCAAGGAGTAGCAAACTA-3\u2032 (Rv). Data were normalized to the input for the immunoprecipitation and the results were reported as fold changes respect to nonspecific IgG.Western blot analysisCells were grown in 10-cm dishes, exposed to treatments, and then lysed as previously described. Equal amounts of whole-protein extract were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Sigma-Adrich, Milan, Italy), which were probed with primary antibodies (1:1000) against HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (R&D Systems, Bio-Techne, Milano, Italy), GPER (AB137479) (Abcam, DBA, Milan, Italy), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), p-AKT1/2/3 (Ser 473)-R, AKT/1/2/3 (H-136), c-fos (E-8) and \u03b2-actin (AC-15; 1:4000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) and then revealed using the chemiluminescent substrate for western blotting Westar Nova 2.0 (Cyanagen, Biogenerica, Catania, Italy). For nuclear extracts, cells were lysed using 300\u2009\u03bcl of cytosolic buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES pH\u20097.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA, pH\u20097.5, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (1.7\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u2009mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u2009mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u2009mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100\u2009mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Following centrifugation (14,000\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C, 10\u2009min), the supernatant was referred to as cytoplasmic fraction and the pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in high salt buffer (20\u2009mM HEPES pH\u20097.9, 25% [v:v] glycerol, 420\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 0.2\u2009mM EDTA and protease inhibitors). For the extraction of nuclear proteins, the obtained solution was vortexed thoroughly, incubated overnight with agitation and centrifugated at 14000\u2009g, 4\u2009\u00b0C for 10\u2009min. Equal amounts of the collected supernatant, which represent the nuclear fraction, were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis was performed as described above. The purity of the nuclear fraction was confirmed by immunoblotting with primary antibodies against \u03b2-actin (AC-15; 1:4000) and anti-LMNB/Lamin (M-20; 1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy).Co-immunoprecipitation assayAfter exposure to treatments, cells were washed and lysed using 500\u2009\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors (1.7\u2009mg/ml aprotinin, 1\u2009mg/ml leupeptin, 200\u2009mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200\u2009mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100\u2009mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min and protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie (Bradford) protein assay. Proteins (200\u2009\u03bcg) were then incubated for 2\u2009h with 900\u2009\u03bcl of immunoprecipitation buffer with inhibitors, 2\u2009\u03bcg of anti-c-fos or anti-GPER antibodies and 20\u2009\u03bcl of Protein A/G agarose immunoprecipitation reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C to pellet beads. Pellets were washed four times with 500\u2009\u03bcl of PBS and centrifuged at 13,000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected, resuspended in 20\u2009\u03bcl RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors, 2X SDS sample buffer and heated to 95\u2009\u00b0C for 5\u2009min. Samples were then run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with primary antibodies. Western blot analysis and ECL detection were performed as described above.Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on a cover slip, serum deprived for 18\u2009h and then exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h. Next, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with PBS and incubated at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight with a primary antibody (1:250) against GPER (AB137479) (Abcam, DBA, Milan, Italy) or Phospho-Myosin Light Chain 2 (Ser19) (p-MLC) (Cell Signaling, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS, probed with alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Phalloidin stainingCells were exposed to treatments for 16\u2009h, washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10\u2009min, washed briefly with PBS, then incubated with Phalloidin-Fluorescent Conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assayThe concentrations of IL-1\u03b2 in supernatants from hypoxia-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were measured using human IL-1\u03b2 ELISA Kit (Thermo Scientific, Monza Italy), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The plates were read at 450\u2009nm on a Microplate Spectrophotometer Epoch\u2122 (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).DCFDA fluorescence measurement of ROSThe non-fluorescent 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) probe was used to evaluate intracellular ROS production. Briefly, cells were incubated with 10\u2009\u03bcM DCFDA (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009min, washed with PBS, and then exposed to treatments for 15\u2009min, as indicated. Cells were then washed with PBS, and the images were obtained using the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed by the Gen5 software (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).Conditioned mediumMDA-MB-231 cells were cultured under normal or low oxygen tension (2%) for 16\u2009h. Thereafter, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3500\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min to remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in the appropriate experiments.Cell spreading assayCells were treated for 16\u2009h, trypsinized and seeded onto fibronectin (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) coated 96-well plate at a density of 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/ml and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Phase-contrast images were captured after 15\u2009min and 60\u2009min. As previously reported, round bright cells were considered unspread, whereas spread cells were defined as those cells that had lost their phase-bright appearance and had readily distinguishable nucleus and cytoplasm and quantified by counting six randomly selected fields in each well under a phase-contrast microscope.Invasion assayTranswell 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane (Costar, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was used to evaluate in vitro cell invasion. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcL serum-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber, coated with Corning\u00ae Matrigel\u00ae Growth Factor Reduced (GFR) Basement Membrane Matrix (Biogenerica, Catania, Italy) (diluted with serum-free medium at a ratio of 1:3). For invasion assays in MDA-MB-231 cells, complete medium was added to the bottom chambers in the presence of treatments where required, then cells were cultured under normoxia or hypoxia for 16\u2009h. For invasion assays in CAFs, conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 cells previously exposed to hypoxia for 16\u2009h was added to the bottom chambers in the presence of treatments, where required. Cells on the upper surface of the membrane were then removed by wiping with Q-tip, and invaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), photographed using Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode Reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and counted using the WCIF ImageJ software.Spheroid formation assayFor spheroid generation, 100\u2009\u03bcL/well of MDA-MB 231 cell suspensions (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104) were dispensed into 2% agar-coated 24-well plates. Three days after seeding, tumor spheroids (a single spheroid per well) were exposed to treatments and a 50% medium and treatment replenishment was performed every 2\u2009days. Images were obtained on day 20 using a conventional inverted microscope, thereafter cell number per spheroid was determined by trypsinizing three different spheroids, mixing the cell suspension with trypan blue and counting the number of viable cells. The total number of cells obtained was divided by the number of trypsinized spheroids.Statistical analysisThe statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls\u2019 test to determine differences in means. The bioinformatics analyses, including t-tests, box plots and scatter plots, were performed using the R tidyverse package (https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/). p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.01 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpression levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are correlated in TNBCa The \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d signaling is a prominent transduction pathway associated with the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients. The top 250 genes correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 in the TCGA dataset were clustered using the KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The x-axis and the y-axis indicate respectively the \u2212log10-adjusted p-value and the different KEGG pathways. The number of the genes represented in the identified pathways is plotted on the right of each bar. The genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway (listed in the pink box) were ordered by their HIF-1\u03b1 correlation coefficients (from high to low) (see Additional file 1). b GSEA confirms an enrichment of the genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway in the TNBC patients with high HIF-1\u03b1 levels, as indicated. The patients of the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were ranked in accordance with the differential HIF-1\u03b1 expression levels. c GSEA reveals an enrichment of the \u201cHIF-1 signaling\u201d genes in the TNBC patients with high IL-1\u03b2 expression. Patients of the TCGA and METABRIC datasets were ranked in accordance with the differential IL-1\u03b2 expression levels. Enrichment scores (ES) and relative p-values are plotteda Scatter plots depicting the correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 expression and IL-1\u03b2 levels in TNBC patients of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and the relative p-values are shown in each panel. b Box plots showing the differential IL-1\u03b2 expression levels in non-TNBC and TNBC patients, as found in the TCGA and METABRIC datasets. The number of patients and p-values are reported in each panelIt is well acknowledged that the transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1 acts as a molecular sensor within the hypoxic breast tumor microenvironment toward aggressive cancer features. Hence, we began our study evaluating the gene signature associated with HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients that are characterized by a poor prognosis. Exploring the TCGA cohort of TNBC patients, the 250 genes mostly correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 were first ranked by Pearson correlation coefficient. In order to investigate the biological significance of these genes, KEGG pathway analysis was then performed using DAVID. The top 250 HIF-1\u03b1 correlated genes were enriched in a set of pathways, as schematically reported in Fig.\u00a01a. The \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d transduction pathway, including IL1B, IL1A, IL1R, IL6, IL6ST, IL7R, IL1RAP, INHBA, OSMR and TGFBR2 that are strongly associated with breast cancer progression, was found significantly correlated with HIF-1\u03b1. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in order to explore the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d expression profile according to the high and low HIF-1\u03b1 phenotypes of both TCGA and METABRIC cohorts of TNBC patients. It is worth noting that the genes included in the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway were found enriched in the group of patients showing high HIF-1\u03b1 levels (Fig. 1b). As IL-1\u03b2 may contribute to breast cancer development and metastasis and may regulate the migratory phenotype of TNBC cells through HIF-1\u03b1, we sought to evaluate whether IL-1\u03b2 could be involved in the activation of a hypoxia-related gene signature in TNBC patients. In this regard, we ascertained that the genes included in the \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway\u201d of the KEGG database are significantly enriched in the TNBC cohorts displaying high IL-1\u03b2 expression of both TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Fig. 1c). Further corroborating these observations, a positive correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and HIF-1\u03b1 levels was found in the TNBC cohorts of both databases (Fig.\u00a02a). Exploring the clinical significance of IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients, we assessed that the IL-1\u03b2 expression levels are significantly higher in TNBC compared to non-TNBC in both TCGA and METABRIC datasets (Fig. 2b). Overall, the aforementioned data suggests that IL-1\u03b2 is engaged by HIF-1\u03b1 toward the development of the aggressive TNBC.

(*), (\u25cb) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured upon normoxia versus cells cultured upon hypoxiaOn the basis of the aforementioned findings and in order to provide novel insights on the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 by hypoxia in TNBC, we ascertained that a low oxygen tension (2% O2, thereafter mentioned as hypoxia) induces the mRNA (Fig.\u00a03a) and protein (Fig. 3b) expression of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, which are a well-recognized model system of TNBC. Upon hypoxic conditions, the mRNA levels of HIF-1\u03b1 did not display any change (Fig. 3a) whereas an increased protein expression was observed (Fig. 3b), in accordance with the known ability of hypoxia to decrease the HIF-1\u03b1 ubiquitination and degradation. Next, performing ELISA assays we determined that the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 increases in the medium of MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxia (Fig. 3c). Remarkably, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 abolished the expression of IL-1\u03b2 prompted by hypoxia, suggesting that HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In accordance with previous findings showing that HIF-1\u03b1 can be induced by proinflammatory stimuli including IL-1\u03b2, we ascertained that IL-1\u03b2 boosts the accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional\u00a0file\u00a02). Worthy, these results suggest that the HIF-1\u03b1-dependent induction of IL-1\u03b2 upon hypoxic conditions may generate a feed-forward loop that further contributes to the stimulatory interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling. Reminiscing our previous data on the action of GPER in hypoxic conditions, we assessed that hypoxia triggers the up-regulation of GPER mRNA (Fig. 3e) and protein (Fig. 3f) levels in a time-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we then found that HIF-1\u03b1 is recruited to the GPER promoter region in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 3g). Moreover, the silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 prevented the protein induction of GPER upon a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3h), indicating that HIF-1\u03b1 is required for the transcription of GPER in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia. Next, the hypoxia increased HIF-1\u03b1 levels were not altered by the silencing of GPER that instead abolished the induction of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 3i). Together, these findings suggest that upon hypoxia HIF-1\u03b1 is involved in the up-regulation of GPER, which then cooperates with HIF-1\u03b1 toward the regulation of IL-1\u03b2. In order to evaluate the transduction mechanism mediating the aforementioned responses, we first assessed that a short exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to hypoxia does increase the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig.\u00a04a), which are required for the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 and the subsequent transduction of the hypoxia-mediated signaling. In the aforementioned experimental condition, we next ascertained that the activation of two main transduction regulators of HIF-1\u03b1, namely ERK1/2 and Akt, is prevented in the presence of the ROS scavenger NAC (Fig. 4b). As c-fos expression is a suitable molecular sensor of both GPER and HIF-1\u03b1 transduction signaling, we also determined that the induction of c-fos protein levels observed upon a 4\u2009h exposure to hypoxia is no longer evident in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD, the PI3K inhibitor LY (Fig. 4c) and NAC (Fig. 4d). Likewise, the increase of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels upon a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxia using either NAC (Fig. 4e) or PD and LY (Fig. 4f), suggesting that the ROS activity triggers the ERK1/2/Akt/c-fos transduction signaling toward the hypoxic regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 expression. In accordance with these findings, the transfection in MDA-MB-231 cells of a plasmid encoding a mutant of c-fos, namely dominant negative c-fos (DN/c-fos), abrogated the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2 triggered by a 16\u2009h exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 4g). In order to evaluate whether the reduction of HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels triggered in the aforementioned experimental condition by the DN/c-fos construct is associated with the HIF-1\u03b1 proteasome-dependent degradation, the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 16\u2009h with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Notably, the MG132 rescued the effects of the DN/c-fos construct on the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels (Fig. 4h), suggesting that c-fos is involved in the complex HIF-1\u03b1 biological regulation at the proteasomal level. By co-immunoprecipitation studies, we also found that hypoxia stimulates a direct interaction between c-fos and HIF-1\u03b1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4i), indicating that the action of c-fos on HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization at least in part occurs through a physical interaction between these two factors. Considering that in our previous study the functional cooperation between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER triggered the expression of certain genes in hypoxic conditions, we first ascertained that HIF-1\u03b1 co-immunoprecipitates with GPER in MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 4j). Thereafter, we evidenced the accumulation of GPER in the nuclear compartment of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia, as evidenced by both immunofluorescence (Fig. 4k) and subcellular fractionation studies (Fig. 4l). Intriguingly, by ChIP assays we then demonstrated that the exposure to hypoxia induces the recruitment of both HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER to a HRE site located within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence (Fig. 4m). Overall, these data suggest that a functional interplay between HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER may be stimulated by hypoxia toward the transcription of IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Hypoxia triggers a functional cooperation among HIF-1\u03b1, GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling toward a metastatic gene expression profile and invasive properties of TNBC cellsConsistent expression changes of metastasis-related genes are induced by hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, as evaluated by TaqMan\u2122 Human Tumor Metastasis Array. a MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. b MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 alone or in combination with IL1R1a.

(*) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured under normoxia versus cells cultured under hypoxia or cells treated with IL-1\u03b2 versus vehicle-treated cellsIn order to provide further insights into the metastatic gene expression profile triggered by hypoxia through the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis, we performed a TaqMan Gene Expression Assay, which consists of a Human Tumor Metastasis Array. In this vein, MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed for 16\u2009h either to hypoxic conditions (Fig.\u00a05a) or the recombinant human IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 5b), in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. Considering the genes resulting with at least a 0.25 log2 fold change upon either hypoxia respect to normoxia-exposed cells (Fig. 5a) or IL-1\u03b2 respect to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5b), 31 and 15 metastatic genes induced respectively by hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 were identified (Fig.\u00a06a). Among the 11 genes up-regulated by either hypoxia or IL-1\u03b2 as depicted in the Venn diagram (Fig. 6a and Additional\u00a0file\u00a03), we then focused on the regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and its target gene cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) considering that their strong increase was abrogated using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig.5a-b). First, we ascertained that a positive correlation does exist between IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 levels in TNBC patients of the METABRIC dataset (Fig. 6b). Thereafter, we confirmed by real-time and western blotting assays that the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a prevents the mRNA (Fig. 6c) and protein (Fig. 6d-e) expression of both IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 induced by a 16\u2009h exposure to either hypoxia or IL-1\u03b2 treatment, in accordance with previous evidence demonstrating that IL-1\u03b2 may auto-regulate its own production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the COX2 protein induction by a 16\u2009h hypoxic condition is prevented by silencing GPER (Fig. 6f), indicating that GPER is involved not only in the above described IL-1\u03b2 expression but also in the increase of COX2 upon hypoxia. The IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 system is involved in the invasive and proliferative features induced by hypoxia in MDA-MB-231 cells. a-b Cell spreading was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with scramble or AsGPER and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) in the presence or absence of IL1R1a.

(*), (\u25cb), (\u25a1) p\u2009<\u20090.05 for cells cultured under normoxia versus cells cultured under hypoxia or treated with IL-1\u03b2 versus vehicle-treated cellsA hypoxic environment may lower cell-ECM adhesion prompting cell motility and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition toward aggressive breast cancer phenotypes. Hence, we evaluated the contribution of GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 mediated signaling in the metastasis-related responses induced by the hypoxia-stimulated IL-1\u03b2 action. In this regard, we assessed that MDA-MB-231 cells cultured under hypoxic conditions exhibit a reduced spreading ability on fibronectin 60\u2009min after seeding respect to cells grown under normoxic conditions (Fig.\u00a07a-b). Notably, this effect was no longer evident silencing GPER as well as using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig. 7a-b). Results similar to those mentioned above were observed treating cells with IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 7c-d). Together, these findings suggest that both GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R axis contribute to hypoxia-decreased cancer cell spreading on the ECM protein fibronectin, according to previous data correlating the hypoxia-lowered cell-ECM adhesion to an increased invasion, intravasation and metastasis. Next, the invasive effects prompted by both hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 treatment were prevented not only by silencing GPER but also using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a, as evaluated by Transwell Matrigel invasion assays (Fig. 7e-f). Moreover, both GPER silencing and IL1R1a lessened the spheroid expansion upon hypoxia and IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 7g). Overall, these findings may suggest that the signaling network of both HIF-1\u03b1/GPER and IL-1\u03b2/IL1R, may lead to an auto-regulatory loop of IL-1\u03b2 toward invasive and metastatic properties of hypoxic TNBC cells. The hypoxic regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling in TNBC cells promotes an invasive CAFs phenotypeThe paracrine action of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 axis promotes the actin-myosin contractility and the invasion of CAFs. a-b Immunoblots of IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 in CAFs exposed to conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells cultured upon normoxia or hypoxia (2% O2) (a) and in CAFs treated with vehicle or IL-1\u03b2 (b), in the presence or absence of IL1R1a. c-d Phosphorylation of MLC in CAFs cultured with conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to normoxia and hypoxia (c) or IL-1\u03b2 (d), in the presence or absence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a.

Values represent the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. (*) p\u2009<\u20090.05On the basis of the aforementioned findings, we sought to provide mechanistic insights into the paracrine IL-1\u03b2 feedback on important components of the tumor microenvironment as CAFs. In this vein, CAFs were cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) collected from MDA-MB-231 cells, which were exposed to hypoxia. Interestingly, the up-regulation of both IL-1\u03b2 and COX2 protein levels occurring in CAFs upon this experimental condition (Fig.\u00a08a) was prevented either using the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a (Fig. 8a) or the neutralizing IL-1\u03b2 antibody (Additional\u00a0file\u00a04). Findings similar to those above mentioned were observed in CAFs treated with IL1\u03b2 (Fig. 8b). Considering that hypoxia may stimulate breast cancer cells toward invasive features as cell motility, formation of stress fibers and matrix contraction, the CM from MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to hypoxia promoted in CAFs the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) on serine-19 (pMLCS19) (Fig. 8c), which is known to be required for the coordination of the actin-myosin contractility. In accordance with these results, an increased MLC phosphorylation was evidenced in CAFs treated with IL1\u03b2 (Fig. 8d). Moreover, immunofluorescent staining of polymerized actin (F-actin) using FITC-conjugated phalloidin revealed an augmented formation of stress fibers upon exposure of CAFs to the CM from hypoxia-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8e) as well as upon treatment with IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 8d). Notable, both pMLCS19 phosphorylation and the increased formation of actin stress fibers triggered in CAFs by the CM from hypoxic MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8c, e) and IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 8d, f), were abolished in the presence of the IL1R1 antagonist IL1R1a. Then, we observed that the invasion of CAFs promoted by the CM from hypoxia-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 8g) or by IL-1\u03b2 treatment (Fig. 8h), was no longer evident in the presence of IL1R1a. Altogether, these results show that the IL-1\u03b2 production by the hypoxic TNBC cells may trigger a paracrine feed-forward signaling that stimulates malignant features in main components of the breast tumor microenvironment as CAFs. DiscussionIn the current study we have provided novel insights regarding the hypoxia-mediated regulation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 transduction signaling in TNBC cells and patient-derived breast CAFs. First, we assessed that the genes belonging to the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway are both associated with HIF-1\u03b1 expression in human TNBC samples and enriched in patients showing high HIF-1\u03b1 levels. Thereafter, we found that the genes included in the \u201cHIF-1 signaling pathway\u201d are enriched in the TNBC cohort displaying high levels of IL-1\u03b2, which is a main component of the \u201cCytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\u201d pathway. Next, we ascertained that IL-1\u03b2 expression is higher in TNBC respect to non-TNBC samples and correlates with HIF-1\u03b1 in TNBC patients. Mechanistically, we then assessed that the HIF-1\u03b1/GPER transduction signaling is involved in the hypoxia-regulated action of IL-1\u03b2, which triggers both a metastatic gene signature and invasive features in TNBC cells. Focusing on the functional interaction that occurs between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma, we also determined that IL-1\u03b2 secreted by hypoxic TNBC cells may promote a feed-forward loop engaging its cognate receptor IL1R1 in breast CAFs. Corroborating these findings, we determined that the conditioned medium collected from TNBC cells exposed to hypoxia stimulates in CAFs the actin polymerization and the MLC phosphorylation, which characterize the attainment of invasive phenotypes.Intratumoral hypoxia, which is a common feature in solid cancers as breast cancer, is associated with an increased risk of metastatic aggressiveness and patient mortality. Of note, cancer cells can adapt to low oxygen tension activating the hypoxia-inducible factors that mainly drive a peculiar gene expression signature. As well-known, the master regulators of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia consist of the oxygen-regulated HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1 and HIF-3\u03b1 subunits and the constitutively expressed HIF-1\u03b2 subunit. The HIF-1\u03b1, 2\u03b1 and 3\u03b1 subunits are subjected to oxygen-dependent processes like prolyl hydroxylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which are inhibited upon hypoxia that triggers the post-translational stabilization and the HIF-\u03b1 protein accumulation. Subsequently, HIF-1\u03b1 binds to the hypoxia response elements regulating the transcription of genes implicated in critical aspects of cancer biology as angiogenesis, stem cell maintenance, metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, metastasis and resistance to therapy. Likewise, hypoxia-activated HIF-1\u03b1 plays a role in the tumor-related inflammation leading to worse clinical outcomes in diverse types of cancers including breast tumors. These events may occur through the HIF-1\u03b1 dependent regulation of signaling mediators and inflammatory genes in both cancer and neighboring cells within the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the pro-tumorigenic action of HIF-1\u03b1 may occur through its interaction with various signaling pathways like transforming growth factor-\u03b2, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Notch and GPCRs. In this regard, GPER was shown to be involved together with HIF-1\u03b1 in the cell adaptation to low oxygen tension in diverse tumors as breast cancer. In particular, hypoxia-activated HIF-1\u03b1 was found to cooperate with GPER in breast cancer cells and CAFs toward gene expression changes and relevant biological responses. Intriguingly, GPER was also shown to trigger the activation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 transduction signaling, which in turn promoted inflammatory responses and aggressive features of breast cancer cells. Further corroborating these findings, we here demonstrate that a functional liaison between HIF-\u03b1 and GPER mediates the induction of IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC cells exposed to hypoxic conditions. In particular, we first evidenced that the up-regulation of GPER upon hypoxia occurs through the recruitment of HIF-1\u03b1 to a HRE site located within the GPER promoter sequence in TNBC cells. Then, we assessed that in hypoxic TNBC cells HIF-1\u03b1 and GPER are both recruited to the HRE site located within the IL-1\u03b2 promoter sequence. It is worth mentioning that many studies have demonstrated that GPER is detectable not only at the plasma membrane level, but also in the intracellular and nuclear compartments. As it concerns the signaling cascade triggering the aforementioned findings, we demonstrated that the ROS-dependent ERK1/2 and AKT activation together with the ensuing c-fos induction contribute to the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1 as well as the up-regulation of GPER and IL-1\u03b2 in hypoxic TNBC cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays also revealed that c-fos both interacts directly and protects HIF-1\u03b1 from the proteasomal degradation.As largely reported, TNBC patients show an elevated incidence of metastatic processes and low survival rates. Unfortunately, TNBCs remain to be fully characterized toward the assessment of reliable prognostic markers and drug targets. Of note, \u201comics\u201d technologies have recently provided intriguing insights into the molecular landscape and the heterogeneous clinical features of TNBC, leading to the identification of potentially actionable targets. In this scenario, the HIF-dependent signaling has been reported to be particularly active in TNBCs, suggesting that hypoxia may play a relevant role toward the peculiar features of TNBCs. Likewise, it has been ascertained that the tumor-stroma inflammation network may prompt the pro-metastatic phenotypes in TNBCs. In this regard, it should be mentioned that IL-1\u03b2 acts as an important effector of the oncogene-driven pathways linking inflammation to cancer. Indeed, IL-1\u03b2 is considered as a master cytokine in the progression of breast cancer as its production has been found correlated with advanced diseases, whereas the IL1R1 inhibition by the antagonist anakinra was shown to prevent the growth of breast cancer and the bone metastasis in mouse models. Further corroborating these data, IL-1\u03b2 was found to contribute to the hypoxia-mediated angiogenesis through the up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1. In the framework of these findings, we have here provided novel evidence regarding the hypoxic-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression and function toward the metastasis-related gene profile as well as the growth and invasive properties of TNBC cells.COX2 is the key enzyme in eicosanoid biosynthesis and the master switch in the activation of the inflammatory responses. The induction of COX2 by inflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, triggers the biosynthesis of prostaglandins from the arachidonic acid, which is a 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid released from membrane phospholipids upon the phospholipase A2 action. Worthy, the constitutive expression of COX2 and the sustained biosynthesis of the main effector of inflammation named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), are both linked to mammary carcinogenesis due to their stimulatory effects on mitogenesis, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis and immunosuppression. In addition, the overexpression of COX2 may occur in approximately 50% of breast cancer and has been found correlated with a reduced disease-free and overall survival and the primary tumor size. Of note, in line with our findings regarding the hypoxia-dependent activation of the IL-1\u03b2/COX2 signaling toward the stimulation of growth and invasion of TNBC cells, previous studies have shown that the MDA-MB-231 cells display a lipidomic profile characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to contribute to breast cancer progression, as mentioned above.In the breast cancer microenvironment, the bidirectional interplay occurring among neoplastic cells with CAFs, tumor-associated macrophages, endothelial and immune infiltrating cells, endorses tumor progression stimulating responses as cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. In particular, CAFs may facilitate the establishment of a conducive microenvironmental niche for the cruitment and maintenance of disseminated tumor initiating cells. Likewise, CAFs may regulate the malignant features fostering the proliferative, migratory and invasive potential of surrounding tumor cells. In this respect, IL-1\u03b2 was involved in the connection between breast cancer cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are considered an additional source of CAFs beyond the fibroblasts. Worthy, the IL-1\u03b2-dictated cellular interaction stimulated the production of diverse chemokines by MSCs as well as an increased motility of TNBC cells. Nicely reminiscing these observations, we have here demonstrated that hypoxic TNBC cells trigger IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 paracrine signals that prompt certain cytoskeletal changes as the MLC-driven formation of actin stress fibers toward invasive properties of breast CAFs. Overall, our data provide novel evidence regarding the mechanisms through which hypoxia triggers the IL-1\u03b2/IL1R1 signaling, which generates a feed-forward stimulatory loop in both TNBC cells and CAFs. Our findings may be therefore considered in more comprehensive therapeutic strategies targeting breast cancer progression.ConclusionsOur data provide novel evidence regarding the molecular mechanisms through which the IL1\u03b2-IL1R signaling does prompt stimulatory effects upon hypoxia in TNBC cells and CAFs. Considering the intricate interplay occurring among diverse players activated by hypoxia even through feed-forward loops, further efforts are warranted to better appreciate this complex scenario toward more comprehensive therapeutic strategies halting the aggressive features of the TNBC.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsACTBActin betaCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsCOX2Cyclooxygenase 2DAVIDDatabase for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated DiscoveryECMExtracellular matrix componentsEREstrogen receptorGPCRsG protein-coupled receptorsGPERG protein estrogen receptorGSEAGene Set Enrichment AnalysisHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2HIF-1\u03b1Hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1IL-\u03b2Interleukin-1\u03b2IL1R1Interleukin 1 Receptor Type 1IL1R1aIL1R1 antagonistKEGGKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and GenomesMETABRICMolecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International ConsortiumNACN-acetyl-L-cysteinePRProgesterone receptorROSReactive oxygen speciesTCGAThe Cancer Genome AtlasTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerVEGFVascular endothelial growth factorPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Rosamaria Lappano and Marianna Talia contributed equally to this work.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s13046-020-01667-y.Authors\u2019 contributionsRL and MM conceived the study, analyzed and interpreted the data.

IntroductionBreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Clinically, breast cancers are categorized into four subtypes based on their intrinsic characteristics of cancer cells to facilitate targeted therapy. Immunohistochemical determinations of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki67 status are used to categorize these tumors. In accordance with the more recent criteria, breast cancers are classified as: (1) luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative); (2) luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%); (3) HER2-enriched (HER2 amplified, ER- and PR-negative); and (4) triple-negative (ER-, PR-, and HER2-negative) subtypes.Prognosis and survival are different depending on these subtypes. Luminal tumors, the most frequent (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses, while HER2-overexpressing and triple-negative tumors are associated with worst prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. For this reason, novel markers to improve prognosis and to decide therapeutic strategies are required.Tumors are complex tissues composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cells, including cancer-cells and stromal cells. It is known that characteristics of stromal cells may dictate tumor outcome in breast cancer. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute the principal component of the tumor stroma. CAFs display a high proliferation rate and show capacity to facilitate tumor progression by degrading and remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM), activating the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting an angiogenic shift, inducing a metabolic reprogramming toward a reverse Warburg phenotype, or stem cell trait achievement, compared with normal fibroblasts. CAFs promote these actions by the secretion of growth factors and cytokines that influence the epithelium behavior. In this context, CAFs can activate the NF\u03baB signaling pathway to evoke a pro-inflammatory response, and through the secretion of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and SDF-1, induce the recruitment of immune cells.In the present study, we have investigated the gene expression of 19 factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas, and their variation after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Those factors were: the calcium-binding protein S100A4, several growth factors (FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, and IGF2), and we also studied inflammatory cytokines (IL6 and IL8), chemokines (CCL2, CXCL12), important proteases (uPA, MMP2, MMP9, and MMP11), the nuclear factor NF\u03baB, and the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP1.2. Material and Methods2.1. Patient Selection and Their Characteristics, and Tissue Specimen Handling This study is a non-randomized prospective research which includes 19 women with a histological confirmed diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma of luminal type. We selected consecutive cases of T1 or T2 invasive ductal carcinoma of luminal type with sufficient tissue for cell culture, during the period between July 2011 and August 2013, who underwent for a tumor resection as their first therapeutic approach. The exclusion criteria were: prior history of malignant tumor, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, uterine cervix cancer in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of breast cancer, and a history of having received any type of therapy prior to surgery. Table 1 shows characteristics of the 19 patients with invasive breast carcinoma, all included in the analyses performed in this study and classified as luminal A (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative) or luminal B (ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-positive or Ki67 > 20%).During the follow-up period, a total of 6 patients developed distant metastases. The follow-up period was 43 months for patients with recurrence and 58 months for patients without. Women were treated according to the guidelines used in our Institution (Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove). Before the evaluation of tumor samples, all patients gave their written informed consent. The study adhered to National regulations and was approved by the Fundaci\u00f3n Hospital de Jove Ethics and Investigation Committee.2.2. Cell LinesThe estrogen-independent human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and the estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, were both purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA).The MCF-7 cell line was cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Lonza, Visp, Switzerland), and the MDA-MB-231 cell line was maintained in high glucose DMEM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS (PAA, North Darmouth, MA, USA) and the antibiotic mixture 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco, Paisley, UK).2.3. Primary Cell Culture Tumor samples were cut into 1 mm3 pieces and enzymatically dissociated in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Roche, Hertfordshire, UK) at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h.After enzymatic digestion, the suspension obtained was centrifuged at 400\u00d7 g for 5 min. Cell pellet was resuspended and cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, 5 \u03bcg/mL insulin (Gibco), 1 \u03bcg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), and 5 ng/mL EGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell cultures exhibited, predominantly, fibroblast morphology after three or four passages. Fibroblast culture purity was analyzed by flow-cytometry (Figure 1) using the antibody CD90 clone AS02 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) incubated at 1:50 (4 \u00b5g/mL) for 45 min. After, two washes with PBS 1X, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody (FITC, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, ref.: 0103) for 30 min. CD90 clone AS02 antibody specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemistry before being used on study samples. Also, we analyzed the expression of CD34 (555822, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), which is expressed by hematopoietic stem cells/progenitors as well as by a multitude of other non-hematopoietic cell types, including epithelial progenitors and vascular endothelial progenitors.2.4. Co-Culture ExperimentsTranswell 24-well plates were used to perform co-cultures of fibroblasts with breast cancer cell lines. Fibroblast cells were plated at 2 \u00d7 104 cells in the bottom of the wells, whereas breast cancer cell lines were seeded (2 \u00d7 104 cells) in the 0.24 \u03bcm pore size tissue culture inserts, which were introduced into the fibroblasts-containing wells later on. Cells were co-cultured for 72 h in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution. Then, RNA extraction was performed using the following protocol.2.5. Real Time-PCR \u201cRNeasy Mini Kit\u201d (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including the DNAse treatment was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for total RNA isolation. As described previously, the integrity and concentration of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by using a NanoDrop Technologies device, (Wilmington, DE, USA). First strand cDNA was synthesized using the \u201cTranscriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit\u201d (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The reverse transcription step was carried out using the following program: firstly, an incubation at 65 \u00b0C during 10 min was performed to ensure denaturation of RNA secondary structures, and then, the reverse transcription reaction was performed as follows: 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, 60 min at 50 \u00b0C, and 5 min at 85 \u00b0C.Expressions of different factors were measured using RealTime ready custom panel plates (Roche). These custom-designed plates contained the specific primers and probes for the factors studied and for three reference genes (Table 2). The mRNA levels were measured in a LightCycler 480 II (Roche) with the following cycling conditions: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 s.The expression was quantified using advanced relative quantification. In this method, the crossing point (Cp) is automatically calculated using the LightCycler software as the first maximum of the second derivative of the curve. A combination of two housekeeping genes (\u03b2-actin and SDHA (Succinate dehydrogenase subunit A)) as a normalization factor was used to minimize sample variability and to increase the accuracy and resolution of gene expression normalization.2.6. ImmunohistochemistryTo study the protein expression of IGF2, immunohistochemistry staining was performed on tissue sections of breast cancer using a TechMate TM50 autostainer (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), a primary antibody against IGF2 (ab9574, Abcam, antigen retrieval pH6, incubation 1 h) and the EnVision Detection kit (Dako). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol and permanently coverslipped, as previously described.2.7. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18. The Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov Test was used to determine whether sample data were normally distributed. As data were normally distributed, comparison between groups was performed with the Student\u2019s t test. Survival curves were calculated with the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Differences were considered significant when the p-value \u2264 0.05. The PASW Statistics program was used for all calculations.3. Results3.1. Molecular Profile of CAFsWe determined whether CAFs from luminal tumors presented phenotypic variability at their basal expression of several genes implicated in tumor progression (S100A4, FGF2, FGF7, HGF, PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF\u03b2, VEGFA, IGF2, IL6, IL8, CCL2, CXCL12, uPA, MMP2, MMP9, MMP11, NF\u03baB, and TIMP1). CCL2 and MMP9 gene expressions were significantly higher in CAFs from luminal B tumors compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors (p = 0.003 and p = 0.02, respectively, Figure 2). However, we found no significant differences in other pro-tumoral factors between CAFs from these two tumor subtypes.3.2. Molecular Profile of CAFs Co-Culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cancer Cell LinesWe next examined the effect of breast tumor cell lines over different CAFs from luminal A or luminal B subtypes. We found different patterns in the expression of pro-tumoral factors depending on the CAF\u2019s luminal type co-cultured with the different cancer cell lines. CAFs from luminal A tumors co-cultured with the luminal cell line MCF-7, showed an increase in VEGFA levels (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A), but a decrease in the gene expression of HGF (p = 0.028), CCL2 (p = 0.028), NF\u03baB (p = 0.046), and MMP-9 (p = 0.028) (Figure 3A). CAFs from luminal B tumors co-cultured with MCF-7 showed a decrease in CCL2 (p = 0.003) and NF\u03baB (p = 0.009) gene expression, while they showed an increased gene expression of other important pro-tumoral factors such as TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.007), CXCL12 (p = 0.013), MMP-2 (p = 0.039) and VEGF A (p = 0.003) (Figure 3B). When CAFs were co-cultured with the triple negative MDA-MB-231 cell line, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increased gene expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA (p = 0.028, for both) (Figure 3C), whereas CAFs from luminal B tumors showed an increased expression in VEGFA (p = 0.003), S100A4 (p = 0.019), TGF\u03b2 (p = 0.004), IL6 (p = 0.049), and IL8 (p = 0.009), but a decrease of NF\u03baB expression (p = 0.028) (Figure 3D). All together, these data suggest that CAFs from luminal B tumors showed, globally, a higher gene expression profile of stromal pro-tumoral factors when co-cultured with any one of these two breast cancer cell lines.3.3. Relationship between CAFs\u2019 Molecular Profile and Development of Distant MetastasisWe also compared the relapse-free survival period with the basal molecular profiling of CAFs. Six patients developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period: two patients with luminal A tumors and four with luminal B tumors. Then, we re-analyzed the gene expression of CAFs comparing those patients developing metastasis with the rest of patients. Interestingly, we found that high IGF2 gene expression (>median) in CAFs was significantly associated with a shortened relapse-free survival (Figure 4A). In addition, higher basal IGF2 gene expression was found in CAFs from metastasic tumors than in CAFs from non-metastasic tumors in all luminal tumors (Figure 4B), and especially, in luminal B tumors (Figure 4C). No significant data was obtained for luminal A tumors due to the low recurrence rate in this population and the small sample size. Finally, we also observed that higher IGF2 gene expression in CAFs from metastatic tumors remained increased after co-culture with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4D,E).In order to confirm the protein expression of IGF2, we stained primary tumors tissue sections and observed the expression by fibroblast (Figure 5). However, we could not analyze all samples (no access to tissue block for all patients) and therefore we could not establish its concordance to metastasis development.4. DiscussionToday, breast tumors are categorized based on cancer cell characteristics for their management. Four main intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, HER2\u2212enriched and basal-like) have been established over the last 15 years. Each of these subtypes has different features, clinical behaviors, and treatment response profiles. Luminal tumors, the most frequent type (accounting for 50\u201360% of breast cancers), are associated with the most favorable prognoses. However, a biological heterogeneity exists in luminal tumors, and numerous patients with these tumors died of relapsed disease. Our results indicate that CAFs from luminal B tumors show more pro-tumor characteristics compared with CAFs from luminal A tumors, which provide evidence of a possible contribution of the stroma to the different biological and clinical behavior between these tumors. Luminal A breast cancers are associated with a most favorable short-term prognosis due to its positive response to endocrine therapy. Luminal B tumors are recognized to have a more aggressive clinical behavior and unfavorable prognosis compared with luminal A tumors. In fact, many of the luminal B tumors are ER+/HER2\u2212/high Ki-67. However, expression profiles also classify the ER+/HER2+ tumors as luminal B, and these patients receive a different therapy regimen (that incorporates targeted anti-HER2 therapy) compared to other luminal B breast cancer. In addition, according to the 2013 St. Gallen Consensus, the diagnosis of a portion of patients with the luminal A subtype with poor prognosis was changed to the luminal B subtype, which was determined based on ER positivity, HER2 negativity, Ki67 expression > 14%, and PgR expression < 20%. Thus, luminal B breast tumors (that accounted for nearly 40% of all breast cancers) constitute the most heterogeneous molecular subtype at the clinical and molecular levels. Unfortunately, the immunohistochemistry of the luminal B subtype, based on intrinsic genetics characteristics from cancer cells, remains poorly defined, and it has now become a paramount importance to find new markers capable of segregating luminal tumors into clinically meaningful subgroups that may be used clinically to guide patient management. With this in mind, in the present study, we have tried to identify CAFs populations differing in their pro-tumor capabilities in these luminal tumors.In the present study, we found variability in the gene expression of factors implicated in tumor progression in CAFs from luminal breast carcinomas (Table 1), and after co-culture with MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines, depending whether those CAFs are from luminal A or B tumors. CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher gene expression of MMP-9 and CCL2 compared to CAFs from luminal A tumors. These findings are relevant if we consider that MMP-9 (also known as Gelatinase B) is related to tumor invasion and metastasis by its capacity to degrade the type IV collagen found in basement membranes, and to induce angiogenesis. Likewise, MMP-9 has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and/or poor prognostic in patients with breast cancer. On the other hand, CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP1) is a chemokine that exerts a potent chemotactic, stimulatory, and mitogenic effects on mononuclear cells. High levels of CCL2 in the tumor microenvironment, as well as high circulating concentrations of this chemokine, have been associated with poor prognosis in breast carcinoma patients. CCL2 also stimulates the migration of mammary carcinoma cell lines, and mediates the recruitment of specific monocyte populations that support the establishment of metastatic disease.Especially relevant were our findings showing that different CAFs populations differentially expressed pro-tumor factors depending on co-cultured cancer cell lines. Thus, after co-culture with the luminal cell line MCF-7, CAFs from luminal A tumors showed an increase in VEGFA levels, but a decreased expression levels of other pro-tumor genes (HGF, CCL2, NF\u03baB, and MMP-9) while CAFs from luminal B tumors although showed decreased levels of CCL2 and NF\u03baB gene expression, but increased gene expression of other important pro-tumor factors like TGF\u03b2, CXCXL12, MMP-2, and VEGF A. Likewise, different patterns of gene expression were found in CAFs from Luminal A tumors, with increased expression of MMP-2 and VEGFA, or CAFs from luminal B tumors, with increased levels of VEGFA, S100A4, TGF\u03b2, IL6, and IL8, but decreased levels of NF\u03baB, after being co-cultured with the cell line MDA-MB-321.In general, CAFs from luminal B tumors showed higher expression of pro-tumor factors when co-cultured with breast cancer cell lines, which is in accordance with the fact that these tumors are associated with higher tumor aggressiveness. These overexpressed factors are of importance promoting several biological aspects of tumor progression. TGF\u03b2 is a well-known cytokine that induces malignant mammary epithelial cell to undergo EMT, leading to the acquisition of highly migratory, invasive and metastatic phenotypes. It has been also described that TGF\u03b2 can induce the expression of different proteins, such as growth factors, cytokines, and ECM proteins in CAFs, which promote tumor development in the adjacent epithelium. CXCL12 is a highly pleiotropic chemokine, influencing a variety of biological processes through the interaction with its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7. CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 signaling has been shown to play a role in tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis and bone marrow cell recruitment. In line with this, it has been demonstrated that co-implantation of tumor cells with fibroblasts expressing CXCL12 enhances tumor growth and CXCL12 overexpression has been linked to increased metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, a number of different agents have been used to block the CXCL12\u2013CXCR4 interaction to inhibit metastasis.MMP-2 (Gelatinase A) together with MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) are related to tumor invasion and metastasis by their special capacity to degrade type IV collagen in basement membrane, and to induce angiogenesis. MMP-2 production increased during the early phase of breast cancer, but also high levels of MMP-2 have been related to poor outcome in breast carcinomas. VEGFA is a potent regulator of angiogenesis and thereby involved in the development and progression of solid tumors, such as breast cancer. S100A4, a member of the S100 calcium-binding protein superfamily, has been described as a key player in promoting metastasis, acting as an angiogenic factor, inducing cell motility, and increasing the expression of MMPs. In fact, elevated levels of the calcium-binding protein S100A4 have been associated with poor patient survival in breast cancer patients and to induce metastasis in rodent models.Interestingly, we have observed high expression levels of IL6 and IL8 in CAFs from luminal B tumors after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells. Previous reports showed that both cytokines are important to maintain the aggressiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells, a highly tumorigenic cell line which appears to be devoid of stemness-related features. In addition, clinical studies have showed that both high levels of IL-6 or IL-8 have been associated with breast cancer recurrence. In addition, several strategies to disrupt IL-6 signaling or IL-8 signaling, in vitro or in vivo, significantly reduce tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer cells.Together, these gene expression data may to contribute to a better characterization of tumor stroma of luminal breast carcinomas.Finally, we reclassified the CAFs gene expression analysis considering patients developing or not distant metastasis during the follow-up period. An obvious limitation of the present study is the reduced number of patients who developed distant metastasis during the follow-up period. Nevertheless, and interestingly enough, we have observed that CAFs from metastatic luminal tumors had the highest IGF-2 gene expression, either in basal levels or after being co-cultured with MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cell lines. These findings seem to be in agreement with previous data revealing that IGF2, which is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of human cancers, is associated with more aggressive tumors and with a poor prognosis. IGF-2 promotes excessive growth and anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells. In fact, it has been shown that IGF-2 signaling is important to stimulate the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. In addition, IGF-2 has been recently implicated in a positive feedback circuit as a critical mechanism to increase stemness and maintain breast cancer cells. More importantly, it has been suggested that CAFs derived from breast metastatic tumors have increased protumorogenic properties due to the increased expression of IGF2. On the other hand, there are several lines of evidence linking IGF signaling and luminal tumors. In one large follow-up study on breast cancer in postmenopausal women, serum levels of IGF-2, but not IGF-1, were positively associated with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer risk. Likewise, it has been reported that both the co-expression and interactions of IGF1R (receptor for IGF-1 and IGF-2) and ER signaling systems suggest a role for the IGF1R network in the resistance to endocrine therapy. It is also remarkable that IGF-2 is known to play an important role during fetal growth and development, and its expression in malignant tumors might implicate a more primitive cellular phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that IGF-2 expression may be a potential useful marker of tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in luminal tumors.In summary, our data may contribute to a better biological characterization of the interaction between cancer cells and tumor stroma in luminal breast carcinomas. In this way, our results allow us to consider that, among the complex array of soluble factors produced by CAFs, it could arise possible new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for luminal breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsConceptualization: N.E., M.F., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Data curation: N.E., M.F., J.R.C., L.O.G., and F.J.V.; Formal analysis: N.O., S.C., M.F., and L.O.G.; Investigation: N.E., S.C., and M.F.; Methodology: N.E. and S.C.; Project administration: N.E. and F.J.V.; Resources: L.O.G. and F.J.V.; Writing\u2014original draft: N.E., S.C., M.F., and F.J.V; Writing\u2014review & editing: N.E., J.R.C., and F.J.V.

        "content": "The lack of targeted therapy for women with triple negative breast cancer demands a \"think-outside-the-box\" approach in search of novel treatment strategies. Although cancer drug development traditionally focused on targeting the tumor cell cycle, emphasis has recently shifted toward the tumor microenvironment for novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. The tumor microenvironment is a dynamic composite of cells broadly categorized as immune cells and nonimmune cells within a scaffold of extracellular matrix, where tumor cells thrive. Among the various nonimmune cell types, cancer stromal cells have emerged as critical players in promoting tumor proliferation, neovascularization, invasion, and metastasis as well as interacting with immune cells to tilt the equilibrium toward a tolerogenic environment that favors the tumor cells. In view of recent work that demonstrated that the depletion of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expressing tumor stromal cells resulted in stunted tumor growth and improved response to tumor vaccination, the tumor microenvironment is, therefore, fertile ground for development of novel therapy with the potential of augmenting existing treatment and prevention options. In this review, we will focus on current evidence supporting the role of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a special focus on FAP(+) stromal cells, in promoting tumor growth. The role of CAFs in promoting an immunosuppressive environment, which may accelerate tumor progression, will be discussed with the hope that therapeutics developed to target the \"generic\" tumor microenvironment may be effective for malignancies such as triple negative breast cancer, for which targeted therapy is not available to date, in the future.",

Wound healing experiment and transwell migration assay were used to investigate the anti-migration effects. Flow cytometry was applied to detect cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in CAFs. Culture SKBr-3 with CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) to evaluate the indirect function on the proliferation of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells. PVP inhibited the viability of CAFs by inducing apoptosis (P &lt;0.01) and arresting cell cycle (P &lt;0.01). It also inhibited the migration of CAFs (P &lt;0.01). bFGF promoted CAFs proliferation (P &lt;0.01) and migration (P &lt;0.01), protected CAFs from apoptosis (P &lt;0.05) and reduced G<sub0</sub phase to 49.06% (P &lt;0.01). However, these effects of bFGF on CAFs could be abrogated by PVP. Culturing SKBr-3 with CAFs-CM, PVP could inhibit the viability of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells indirectly. Moreover, PVP reduced the mRNA expression (P &lt;0.01) and protein secretion of bFGF (P &lt;0.01) in CAFs. PVP could exert an anti-cancer effect on breast CAFs by inhibiting bFGF expression, thus inhibiting the growth of breast cancer SKBr-3 cells indirectly.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute a major compartment of the tumor microenvironment. In the present study, we investigated the role for CAFs in breast cancer progression and underlying molecular mechanisms. Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the CAF-conditioned media manifested a more proliferative phenotype, as evidenced by enhanced messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) expression was well correlated with the presence of CAFs. We noticed that the mRNA level of FGF2 in CAFs was higher than that in normal fibroblasts. FGF2 exerts its biological effects through interaction with FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). In the breast cancer tissue array, 42% estrogen receptor-negative patients coexpressed FGF2 and FGFR1, whereas only 19% estrogen receptor-positive patients exhibited coexpression. CAF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasiveness were abolished when FGF2-neutralizing antibody was added to the conditioned media of CAFs. In a xenograft mouse model, coinjection of MDA-MB-231 cells with activated fibroblasts expressing FGF2 dramatically enhanced tumor growth, and this was abrogated by silencing of FGFR1 in cancer cells. In addition, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with FGF2 enhanced expression of Cyclin D1, a key molecule involved in cell cycle progression. FGF2-induced cell migration and upregulation of Cyclin D1 were abolished by siRNA-mediated FGFR1 silencing. Taken together, the above findings suggest that CAFs promote growth, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells via the paracrine FGF2-FGFR1 loop in the breast tumor microenvironment.",

        "title": "Deciphering the temporal heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblast subpopulations in breast cancer.",
        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

        "content": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a secreted endothelial-specific growth factor that is angiogenic in vivo. It is commonly expressed in a range of carcinomas. The study was designed to investigate the effect of constitutive expression of VEGF on tumor formation by estrogen-dependent human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. A full-length complementary DNA encoding the shortest isoform of VEGF (VEGF121) was stably transfected into MCF-7 cells. Transfected clones were screened for VEGF121 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by ribonuclease protection analysis and for secretion of VEGF121 protein by Western blot analysis. Secretion of biologically active VEGF121 by transfectants was confirmed by 1) a competitive radioreceptor-binding assay, 2) stimulation of the growth of microvascular endothelial cells in vitro, and 3) potent angiogenic activity in the rabbit corneal assay. Tumor models were then established by subcutaneously implanting wild-type or VEGF121-transfected MCF-7 cells, together with either mouse BALB/3T3 clone A31 fibroblasts or human MDA-435S breast carcinoma cells, into ovariectomized nude mice either with or without a separately implanted slow-release estrogen pellet. Tumor vascularity was quantitatively assessed by capillary vessel counting after staining with the pan-endothelial marker CD31. Stable VEGF121-overexpressing MCF-7 cells were isolated and designated V12 cells. When implanted into the rabbit cornea, V12 cells elicited a strong directional outgrowth of capillaries. The growth rate of V12 cells in vitro was indistinguishable from that of MCF-7 wild-type cells. V12 cells formed faster growing tumors than did wild-type cells (P &lt; .01) when xenografted subcutaneously into nude mice with either 3T3 fibroblasts or MDA-435S cells. Tumors formed from V12 cells were more vascular (P &lt; .01) and showed a heterogeneous distribution of vessels when compared with the homogeneous distribution seen in tumors formed from wild-type cells. VEGF121 overexpression had no effect on hormone dependence or tamoxifen sensitivity of tumor formation by MCF-7 cells in mice. No macroscopic evidence for metastasis from subcutaneous implants was obtained. VEGF121 expression by breast carcinoma cells confers a growth advantage in vivo but not in vitro. Tumors formed by V12 transfectants were more vascular than those formed by wild-type MCF-7 cells, and we surmise that the growth advantage arises from increased tumor vascularization induced by VEGF121. Tumor formation by V12 cells could provide a useful model for the assessment of anti-angiogenic drugs.",

        "full_text": "Origami folding: Taxing resources necessary for the acquisition of sequential skillsSequential skill learning with practice is fundamental to human activity (e.g., tying shoes). Given the lack of prior knowledge in most participants, Origami folding is a promising task to study the acquisition of a sequential skill. While previous Origami folding studies mainly dealt with the question, which forms of instruction can lead to better learning outcomes, we employ a dual-task approach to test which resources are necessary for folding and for improvement with practice. Participants (N = 53) folded five Origami figures for four times each, which were randomly paired with five types of secondary tasks to cause either cognitive (verbal vs. visuospatial) or motoric (isochronous vs. non-isochronous tapping) memory load or none (control condition). Origami performance showed a typical learning curve from Trial 1 (first run of folding the figure) to Trial 4 (fourth run of folding the same figure). We tested for a dissociation between variants of memory load influencing Origami folding performance vs. the variants influencing learning (i.e. change in performance across practice). In line with theories suggesting that learning operates on the level that (at a given point in practice) demands the most control, we did not observe cases where a dual-task variant influenced performance while it did not affect learning. Memory load from the cognitive visuospatial secondary task as well as the isochronous tapping secondary task interfered with improvement in Origami folding with practice. This might be due to the use of visuospatial sketchpad and absolute timing mechanism during the acquisition of Origami folding.IntroductionMany of our everyday life skills are determined by a certain sequence [cf. ]. Origami paper folding also consists of performing series of actions following a specific sequence. If one step is wrong or ignored, it is very unlikely that the figure can be folded correctly. Studies in movement science show that the motor and cognitive control in sequential skills often interfere with each other in a trade-off manner. For instance, attentional resources are allocated with prioritization to the postural task to avoid falling in elderly people. There is a degraded performance in postural control when participants are concurrently solving a spatial working memory task.Under dual-tasking, selective memory load can affect performance due to our limited processing capacity in working memory [e.g., ]. Yet the cognitive resources needed to perform the sequential skills might be different from the cognitive resources required to learn the sequential skills, which can be measured by the improved performance across trials with practice. Past studies suggest that motor learning can work even better when there is concurrent cognitive load. Langhanns and M\u00fcller documented better performance with paddleball task (fast rhythmic movement) under dual-tasking compared to the single-task condition. Better performance in circle drawing was observed in the dual-tasking condition compared to single-tasking. Decreased time variability of finger tapping was reported under dual-tasking compared to single-tasking. Blanchard et al. showed an increase in body sway (indicating degraded performance) when standing still compared to standing still while concurrently performing a secondary task (reading aloud or counting backward). Presumably, cognitive monitoring is harmful for some motor control process [cf. ]. Some motoric sequences rely on fine-grained movement patterns involving smooth and temporally accurate processing. Cognitive monitoring can interfere with motor processes that rely on subroutines acquired earlier. Therefore, relying on cognitive monitoring for more than initial scaffolding of the configuration of motor control might delay shifting control to the adequate level. Adequate secondary memory load might reduce the capability to engage in cognitive monitoring and drive participants to rely on automated subroutines more quickly. In this study, we examined whether and which type of memory load interferes with the performance and learning (change in performance across practice trials) of a sequential skill.As cognitive control and motor control are required to fold Origami [cf. ], a secondary task is added so that cognitive or motor capacity can be loaded. Participants folded each figure four times. We analyzed the change in performance across the four trials in folding the same Origami in order to examine which resources are necessary on performance vs. acquisition of sequential skills. How well one acquires the skill of folding can be estimated by change in performance across practice trials. If a specific secondary task disrupts Origami folding, it will be assumed that folding and the secondary task use overlapping resources. Potentially, resources required for improving Origami folding from one trial to the next do not completely overlap with the resources required for executing the sequential skill. This would show by differences in which secondary tasks have an impact on skill performance vs. skill acquisition (changes in performance through practice).Origami folding taskSo far the effects of memory load on sequential skills have been tested by using tasks like walking, paddleball or pegboard, or ankle movements. Our decision to combine an Origami folding task with various memory load tasks was guided by three motives. First, despite that Origami folding has been spread out through the world for a long time, many people are novices (different from e.g. car driving) so that acquisition of a sequential skill can be studied. The long history might also help to motivate novices to learn the skill. It is believed that paper folding developed after the invention of paper in 105 A.D. in China and was spread by Buddhist monks through Korea to Japan in 6th century. Nowadays most people have easy access to paper and most have experiences in folding planes or cranes. Second, Origami folding consists of common features of sequential skills and has been used to study the acquisition of sequential skills. People execute hierarchical action plans, which decompose an overreaching goal into sub-goals, to organize behavior [cf. ]. Third, unlike driving or playing piano, paper folding experiments require only papers and are ideal for research projects with tight budgets.Tenbrink and Taylor proposed four stages in Origami paper folding by analyzing the verbal protocols during the folding task. The first stage is reading. At this stage, participants read the instruction, such as an image showing \u201cfold two corners under the inside part of the wings\u201d. Some people start directly with the second stage reformulating. They interpret the meaning of the instruction in their own words. According to the results of Tenbrink and Taylor, the third stage is reconceptualizing by adding ideas about the folding step. During reconceptualization, participants use many spatial concepts \u201cin, on, to, up, middle\u201d. The authors furthermore discuss the relevance of processing crease, alignment and orientation of the objects. This highlights the mental operations necessary to move from two-dimensional instruction to three-dimensional product. The last stage is the evaluation of the product in comparison to the instruction.The underlying mechanism of learning Origami is motor skill learning, marked by increasingly accurate movements in space and timing with practice. It is a fundamental ability of human activity. Without motor skill learning, even simple tasks like tying shoes can cost a large amount of attention each time. In accordance with Willingham, two mechanisms facilitate motor skill learning. On the one hand, each time a task is executed, the processes of motor control (i.e., perceptual-motor integration, sequencing and dynamic processes) can be tuned and transformed more efficiently. On the other hand, the strategic process can support motor skill learning by selecting goals that are more effective or selecting and sequencing targets that are more effective for movements. In addition, the mechanism involved in learning the sequential skill are related to the Mirror Neuron System. It is a system that binds motor perception and motor practice, which can be activated by imagining an action or observing a human movement.The current study employed paper folding to test how sequential skills are acquired with practice. Previous Origami folding studies mainly dealt with the question of which forms of instruction can lead to better learning outcomes, e.g., animation vs. static graphs or text only vs. text with graphs. However, the studies have not addressed the question how sequential skills are acquired under repetitive practices (i.e., time course of practice-related improvements, impact of memory load as an indicator of potential resources involved). Since we all have the experience to learn sequential skills (e.g., dancing, cooking) with more than one attempt, it is important to investigate which type of resources are involved in the acquisition of sequential skills with practice.Dual-task interferenceAtkinson and Shiffrin suggested that the human cognitive architecture includes a working memory with limited capacity and an extensive long-term memory. Recent works suggest analogous mechanisms of selection and updating in declarative and procedural working memory. Working memory capacity has been estimated to be four items [e.g., ] and has been discussed with respect to implications in learning settings [see a review: ]. One influential model suggests that working memory consists of a central executive, a phonological loop to manipulate the verbal information, and a visuospatial sketchpad to store imagery. The visuospatial sketchpad might be relevant in Origami folding as participants are asked to comprehend the pictures of folding steps. Although learning Origami folding is a pictorial task, it can still interfere with the phonological loop. Previous studies on implicit sequence learning have shown that an auditory (auditory-verbal) task can significantly interfere with the acquisition of a sequential skill in a spatial (visual manual\u2013screen locations to key locations) task. The cognitive processes involved in Origami folding include that participants reformulate and reconceptualize the instruction in their own words or thoughts to conduct the movements. During the comprehension of pictures, the perceived information from images in pictorial channel can be converted to the phonological loop in the verbal channel [cf. Integrative Model of Text-Picture Integration, ]. When the mental representation of the instruction is constructed, the information can be converted to verbal as well as pictorial information. For example, after seeing the picture of one folding step some participants might use their own words to explain which action they should perform. Origami folding would therefore make use of the visuospatial sketchpad as well as the phonological loop and the central executive to transfer information between the two storages. A secondary task could demand resources that are lacking for the information transformation processes necessary for folding and necessary to assign credit to particular steps in the folding process in order to learn to improve performance [cf. ].Sequential skills often involve a trade-off between cognitive and motor control [see a review, ]. The Motor Simulation Theory [, see a review, ] proposes that the human motor system is part of a simulation network. It consists of motor imagery (mental representation of the action without engaging in the movement) as well as motor execution. The motor imagery rehearses motor-related information off-line by simulating the action execution and finally configures the motor system according to the intended actions. Motor imagery and action execution hence can share common mental representations and mechanisms. Take Origami folding as an example, participants use motor imagery to animate the static folding steps without performing any movement. Then they execute the action by translating the motor imagery into folding actions. A secondary motor task could request resources that are necessary for the motor imagery and action execution of Origami folding. Thus, secondary task load might influence performance and learning. Furthermore, learning might ease the impact of a secondary task. To the extent the sequential skill is learned (i.e., information is stored in motor chunks [cf. ] or is stored as higher order units called cognitive schemata, [cf. ]), people might need to rely less on instructions and convertibility between verbal vs. visual format or cognitive vs. motor system. This would leave more resources for the secondary task.When we perform multiple tasks simultaneously, the execution of the tasks normally slows down due to dual-tasking interference. There are many hypotheses explaining this issue [see a review: ]. The single channel Bottleneck hypothesis presumes that information processing has a bottleneck or filter with limited capacity. The Attentional Resource theory suggests that the limited capacity central processor can, to some extent, be shared between tasks. The mental resources can be allocated to one task and the leftover resources can be applied to the other task. However, the evidence of material-specific trade-offs between the primary and the secondary tasks leads to a new perspective: The Multiple Resource theory. It assumes that two parallel tasks only interfere with each other when using the same mental resources. Due to the evidence of verbal-pictorial dual-channel process [e.g., ] and the trade-offs between cognitive and motor control [e.g., ], the Multiple Resource theory is used to explain how memory load affects the acquisition of sequential skills.Cognitive and motor controlAccording to the Baddeley-model, dual task paradigms can lead to resource conflicts in the phonological loop or in the visuospatial sketchpad. By testing participants on a task paired with either load for the visuospatial sketchpad or load for the phonological loop, researchers can check which representation format their task of interest seems to be mostly drawing upon. For instance, when asking participants to memorize chess configurations, impairment was revealed for the visuospatial sketchpad only. Similarly, only interference with a visuospatial working memory load task was revealed when participants performed a mental animation task and a visuospatial vs. verbal memory load task concurrently [, cf. ]. We thus used cognitive verbal and cognitive visuospatial secondary tasks to test which representation format was mostly relevant for Origami folding and improvement in folding.According to the Multiple Resource theory, dual-task paradigms can lead to resource conflicts between cognitive and motor control. Finger tapping of interval patterns is used in the experiment to examine the motor control under dual-tasking [e.g., ]. When perceiving the interval patterns, people attempt to generate an internal clock, which enables the accurate representation of temporal structure. Whether the internal clock is successfully used or not depends on the structure of the rhythmic patterns, which have been differentiated into patterns with isochronous structure (inter-stimulus onset intervals, IOIs, of equal duration) or non-isochronous structure (IOIs of arbitrary durations). When the rhythmic patterns are isochronous, the clock can be evoked and the temporal structure can be represented accurately. In contrast, when the clock is not evoked, the temporal structure is not represented accurately and reproduction is based on the assimilation and distinction principles. The assimilation principle refers to the tendency to equalize similar temporal intervals. For example, people tend to assimilate rhythmic patterns with 4:5 ratio (e.g., 400ms vs. 500ms) towards a 1:1 ratio. The distinction principle refers to the tendency to distinguish different temporal intervals by categorizing them into long vs. short intervals. For example, rhythmic patterns with 3:2 ratio (e.g., 900ms vs. 600ms) tend to be reproduced with a long/short ratio of 2:1 by exaggerating the longer intervals to duple multiple of the basic interval. Taken together, the absolute timing mechanism (i.e., exact temporal values) is prompted with isochronous structure. The relative timing mechanism (i.e., relative temporal ratios) is evoked with non-isochronous structure. As sequential skills involve movement in accurate timing, we speculated that tapping rhythmic patterns with isochronous vs. non-isochronous patterns would to a different extent overload the limited resources in motor modality, leading to decrements in improvements of Origami folding.Research questionIn this article we aimed at comparing how different variants of memory load affect performance in Origami folding and acquisition of Origami folding (change in performance across practice trials on a specific figure). To this end, we compared the course of the Origami performance from Trial 1 to Trial 4 accompanying four variants of memory load (cognitive verbal, cognitive visuospatial, motoric isochronous tapping, motoric non-isochronous tapping) with single-task Origami folding.The abovementioned studies suggest that different perspectives on the resources necessary for Origami folding need to be tested by using different variants of dual-task load. In particular, we hypothesized that visuospatial load and timing load should interfere with practice-related improvement in Origami folding (Hypothesis 1). On a more general level, theories linking motor control to learning [cf. ] can be taken to suggest that load effects on change in performance should align with load effects on performance. Accordingly, we hypothesized that effects of load on learning (change in performance) should also influence performance of Origami folding (Hypothesis 2).Materials and methodsIn the experimental setting, speed and accuracy of responses were recorded to examine the behavioral changes of the Origami folding task (Task 1) and the secondary tasks (Task 2). Program, data and folding instructions are available online [, https://osf.io/p3tyf/].ParticipantSixty-one participants were recruited for the experiment. Of these, data from eight participants were excluded because they did not complete the experiment. Data from 53 participants are reported (Mage = 34.5 years, SD = 8.9, range = 18 to 58; 29 females, 21 males and 3 others). The mean age of participants was higher than in many laboratory studies in cognitive psychology as students at University of Hagen (state-run distance teaching university in Germany) are older and more heterogeneous in age than students at other universities. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision acuity and hearing ability. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the German Psychological Association (April 19, 2018). Participants gave their written informed consent before their participation. The experiment was part of the four theses for a Bachelor of Science program. Participants took part in the two-hour experiment voluntarily for no extra reward. Each participant folded 20 Origami figures (five figures four times each). Overall participants folded 1,060 Origami figures.Experimental materialOrigami folding task (Task 1)Each trial consisted of an Origami folding task (Task 1) and a secondary task (or single-tasking; see Table 1). For the Origami folding task, we selected randomly five relatively easy-to-fold figures: chair, box, penguin, butterfly and frog [see ]. The Origami chair contained nine steps and all the other Origami figures contained 10 steps. We designed the folding materials in black and white (800 \u00d7 800 pixel resolution) by using the software Excel and PowerPoint from Microsoft Office. The order of the Origami folding task was identical for each participant: chair, box, penguin, butterfly, and frog.The sequence of the Origami folding task (Task 1) and the secondary tasks.\tChair\tBox\tPenguin\tButterfly\tFrog\t \t1\tCV\tCS\tMI\tMN\tNone\t \t2\tCS\tMI\tMN\tNone\tCV\t \t3\tMI\tMN\tNone\tCV\tCS\t \t4\tMN\tNone\tCV\tCS\tMI\t \t5\tNone\tCV\tCS\tMI\tMN\t \tThe sequence of Origami folding was the same for each participant (i.e., chair\u2014box\u2014penguin\u2014butterfly\u2014frog). Sequences of the secondary task variants (CV: Cognitive Verbal task; CS: Cognitive Visuospatial task; MI: Motoric Isochronous Tapping; MN: Motoric Non-isochronous Tapping) to the Origami figures were counterbalanced according to a Latin square, shown in the chart. Each row represents the combinations of the two tasks for one participant. The condition within each cell was presented four times per participant (four trials of practice with the same Origami and the same secondary task demand in direct succession).Secondary task variants (Task 2)Each participant performed four folding runs with each Origami figure with the same variant of dual-task demand. Each participant was to fold all five Origami figures and received all five variants of dual-task demands (pairing counterbalanced across participants with a Latin square).Cognitive verbal secondary task. The first type was an Origami folding task combined with a cognitive verbal secondary task. On each trial, the participant received a list with three letters (e.g., R M D) and should keep them in mind (see Condition 1 in Fig 1). Letter lists were generated randomly from a letter pool with 16 uppercase consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, and W. No letter was repeated within a letter list. No vowels were used to minimize the chances of creating a pronounceable string of letters. The letters were 100 pixel high. The letter string was visible for 3 seconds. Then an instruction of an Origami folding step appeared. After the participant folded the paper, she or he pressed the Enter key. For verification, the participant was shown a second list with three letters. For half of the trials, the letter list was identical to the initial list (true trial). For the other half of the trials, one randomly chosen letter was switched with another letter in the letter pool (false trial). For instance, when the letter list was \u201cR M D\u201d and verification task was \u201cR M D\u201d, the answer for the verbal secondary task was \u201ctrue\u201d. If the letter list was \u201cR M D\u201d and the verification task was \u201cR M S\u201d, the trial was false. The participant decided whether the second letter list was different (N key) or identical to the initial letter list (C key).Schematic depiction of the Origami figures and the secondary tasks.Each participant folded five Origami figures successively: Chair, box, penguin, butterfly and frog for four times. The secondary tasks were counterbalanced across particicpants. This participant folds the chair figure from folding Step 1 to folding Step 9 in four runs. Each time, the participant receives a list of three letters for three seconds and then an instruction of a folding step. After completing the folding step, the participant verifies whether the second letter list is identical (press C key) or different (press N key) to the initial list. In the consecutive blocks, the participant folds the box figure (with the cognitive visuospatial memory load), the penguine figure (with motoric isochronous tapping memory load), the butterfly figure (with motoric non-isochronous tapping memory load), and the frog figure (with no memory load).Cognitive visuospatial secondary task. The second type of secondary task variant was to fold the Origami with a visuospatial interference task. The participant was first shown a 4 \u00d7 4 grid containing three black squares for 3 seconds (see Condition 2 in Fig 1). Each square was 100 pixel and the grid was 400 pixel in width and in height. The task was to memorize the pattern of squares for later verification. The positions of the squares were generated randomly. The only constraint was that the three squares could not fall in a straight line. In-between new memory items, the participant received an instruction to fold an Origami step. After the folding step was completed, she or he pressed Enter. For verification, participants were presented a second grid containing three squares. Trials were constructed so that half of them were true (first matrix identical to second matrix) and half were false. For the false trials, one randomly chosen square was moved by one space in the grid. The direction of movement of this square was generated randomly and was constrained in a way that a straight line was not formed. As shown in Fig 1, if the grid with three black squares was identical before and after the folding task, participants were to respond \u201ctrue\u201d. The participant pressed the C key for true trials and the N key for false trials.Motoric isochronous tapping secondary task. The third type was to complete an Origami folding task with a motoric isochronous tapping secondary task. That is, participants were asked to tap repeatedly IOIs (inter-stimulus onset intervals) of equal duration. The participant first listened to an isochronous pacing beat with four tones (each in 440 Hz with a pitch of A4 with a duration of 100ms). The IOI was generated randomly one out of three intervals of one, duple and triple multiples of the basic interval onset 300ms (i.e., 300ms, 600ms, 900ms), similar to metrically structured patterns in other studies. Unlike the original patterns in the study of Povel and Essens, we used only the sub-seconds range, as Holm et al. found the interference of load on tapping in the sub-seconds range rather than in the supra-seconds range. One example of the isochronous beat was 300ms, 300ms, 300ms. The beat was played by the laptop\u2019s built-in speaker. After the folding task, the participant tapped the rhythm by pressing the space bar. They could tap with fingers of either hand or both hands. Only if they tapped the space bar four times, the next trial appeared. The program recorded the respective inter-response intervals (IRIs) of the taps. We considered the trial correct, when the variability of IRIs was less than 20% of the IOIs regarding absolute timing or relative timing [cf. ].Motoric non-isochronous tapping secondary task. The fourth type was to pair the Origami folding task with a motoric non-isochronous tapping secondary task. That is, participants tapped the IOIs of arbitrary durations. The participant first listened to a pacing beat with four tones (440 Hz with a duration of 100ms) in unequal intervals. The IOIs were generated randomly from three time intervals (300ms, 600ms, and 900ms). One constraint was that one of the three time intervals could not be chosen for three times to avoid producing the isochronous beat. One possible non-isochronous rhythm was 600ms, 300ms, 300ms. After the folding task, the participant tapped the beats by pressing the space bar. Only if they tapped the space bar for four times, the next trial appeared. The program recorded the IRIs of the taps. The trial was classified as correct, when the variability of IRIs was less than 20% of the IOIs regarding absolute timing or relative timing.None. The last variant was to fold each origami figures for four times without the secondary task.ApparatusThe experiment was implemented in Lazarus. The experiment was displayed on a Lenovo Thinkpad T530 laptop with a 12.5-inch display. The keys for entering secondary task responses (C, or N, or space bar) and folding step ends (Enter) were highlighted with colored self-adhesive dots. Additionally, 24 sheets of 210 \u00d7 210 mm white papers were available for each participant for the Origami folding task.ProcedureThe experiment was conducted individually in a quiet environment. At the beginning, participants were informed about the procedure of the study and that they could quit the experiment at any time. They signed the form of consent. Data were acquired anonymously, the program registered the demographic information such as age and gender and the folding times and responses to the secondary tasks. The experimenters recorded the accuracy of the folding task. Before folding, the folding instruction handouts were passed to the participant. Participants were informed about the terminologies and meanings of symbols before folding. For instance, they saw the folding states in Fig 2, which are snapshots of folding motions (indicated by arrows). There are many creases, which are line segments on a piece of paper [cf. ]. They can be folded in two ways. A mountain fold displayed in solid lines forms a protruding ridge. A valley fold shown by dash lines forms an indented trough. The light grey side represents the front side of the paper and the dark grey side represents the backside of the paper. The five-page instructions including all folding steps described the particularly difficult folding steps with textual explanations, which were supposed to help participants to better understand the instructions. Participants did not fold at this stage and only read the folding instructions.The folding instruction handout for Origami figure penguin.Only the critical steps were described (originally in German). In the experiment, participants received each time only one folding step.After these general instructions, participants received the papers to fold and the experiment started. To enable time measurement for the folding steps, the participants were only allowed to perform folding steps if indicated by the program. The participants were informed to perform the tasks as accurately and as quickly as possible. During the experiment, Origami folding was only interrupted for introducing the secondary tasks. Before each folding step, the secondary task was presented. The cognitive verbal and cognitive visuospatial secondary tasks were displayed for three seconds. The motoric isochronous tapping and non-isochronous tapping secondary tasks were played with three IOIs (300ms, 600ms, 900ms). The display changed automatically to the folding step instructions after presentation of the secondary task. Once the participants completed the folding step, they pressed the Enter key to proceed. This was also the case if the participants decided that they were unable to complete the step successfully. The experimenter registered the success of each folding step by observation. After the folding step, the secondary task response was registered. No feedback was provided about speed and accuracy.If an Origami folding run contained wrongly executed steps or was entirely unsuccessful, a hint was given by the experimenter on how to avoid the errors in the following trials before it started. These specific instructions that went beyond a pure pictorial and textual representation enabled the participants to master the steps at which they failed before [see ]. The support after errors was necessary as we compared the change in performance through practice in Origami folding. Without the support, many participants would not have completed folding the figures for four times. The entire experiment contained five blocks (each block contained an Origami figure) of four folding trials each. Trial 1 referred to the first run of folding a figure with all folding steps. It is important to note that the secondary task and the Origami figures were unchanged within a block. After self-paced folding of each Origami figure, participant could choose to have a break. Each participant was to fold the five different Origami figures four times each, totalling 20 figures. The overall experiment took around 2 hours per participant.MeasurementsWe recorded the RTs (reaction times) and error rate per folding step for different secondary tasks for each participant. RTs per folding step were determined based on the interval between the onset of the displayed folding step and pressing the Enter key to indicate completion. Error rates of each folding step were noted by the experimenters. RTs of the cognitive secondary tasks were based on the interval between the start of the verification task and the registration of the response key (either C or N). Responses of the cognitive secondary tasks and IRIs of the taps were registered by the program as well. Mean RTs and error rates were calculated by using a statistical software R.ResultsWe excluded the last step in all the Origami figures due to a programming error. In addition, we excluded trials with RTs of Origami folding task longer than 100 sec (2.1% of all trials). There was no speed-accuracy trade-off. Rather, we obtained a small and positive (r = .26) correlation between error rate and completion time. In detail, we computed a correlation for the RT and the completion time of the five Origami figures individually for each participant and then aggregated across participants.Given that folding an Origami consisted of different steps, we also explored the variability of time demands in each step of different Origami figures. The average folding time (averaging across all trials) was 19.70 sec (SD = 7.63 sec). The average error rate was 10.9% (SD = 31.1%). The chair took 19.50 sec (SD = 15.80 sec) to be folded and it had an average error rate of 8.7% (SDerror = 28.2%); box 19.46 sec (SD = 17.10 sec; Merror = 11.5%, SDerror = 31.9%), penguin 21.24 sec (SD = 19.17 sec; Merror = 12.9%, SDerror = 33.5%), butterfly 19.19 sec (SD = 16.87 sec; Merror = 11.1%, SDerror = 31.4%) and frog 18.23 sec (SD = 15.03 sec; Merror = 9.9%, SDerror = 30.0%). The fluctuation in Fig 3 (error rates see S1 Table in S1 Appendix) likely reflects the differences in complexity among individual folding steps. Taking the most difficult Penguin figure as an example (see Fig 2), the simpler folding Step 2 (\u201cTurn the paper over and fold the lower corner to the middle\u201d) required only 4.49 seconds (SD = 3.33 sec) on average with an average error rate of 5.66% (SDerror = 23.3%) in Trial 1. In contrast, Step 6 (\u201cFold the corners under the inside part of the wings\u201d) took 42.31 seconds (SD = 28.03 sec). It had an average error rate of 73.58% (SDerror = 44.5%) in Trial 1. This high variability suggests to proceed by analyzing the effect of dual-task variant on performance and change in performance on the level of entire Origami figures rather than at the level of steps. To avoid the influence of various levels of difficulty caused by different shapes, we used the design of a Latin-square table (see Table 1), so that the different shapes were combined with all kinds of memory load.RTs in four practice trials for individual Origami figures.The numbers represent the folding steps. Due to a programming error, the last step in all Origami figures was excluded. The error bars reflect the standard errors of the mean.In the main analysis, we examined the performance in the Origami folding task by pairing the baseline (no dual-task load) with each dual-task condition (see Table 2). Before coming to the main analysis, we checked whether there were differences among the dual-task conditions and whether there was an effect of practice. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with four variants of memory load (cognitive verbal, cognitive visuospatial, motoric isochronous tapping, motoric non-isochronous tapping) \u00d7 4 levels of practice (Trial 1 to Trial 4). The results showed a main effect of memory load, F(3, 156) = 4.07, p = .008, \u03b7p2 = .07, indicating differences among the memory load variants. The main effect of practice, F(1.84, 95.87) = 41.57, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .77, reflected strong performance gains (here and elsewhere we applied Greenhouse Geisser-correction when appropriate). However, no interaction of memory load and practice was present, F(5.56, 289.07) = 1.16, p = .33, \u03b7p2 = .02.The average RTs and error rates of Origami folding task (T1) with all variants of memory load.\tTrial 1\tTrial 2\tTrial 3\tTrial 4\tAverage\tDiffTrial1-4\t \tRTs in sec Mean (SD)\t\t\t \tCog.

As learning can be estimated by improvement of performance through practice, the interaction of load type and practice is in the focus of the report. The performance of the secondary tasks is reported in the S2 Table in S1 Appendix.Origami folding with cognitive visuospatial memory load vs. no loadWe used a 2 load types (cognitive visuospatial memory load vs. no load) \u00d7 4 levels of practice (Trial 1 to Trial 4) repeated-measures ANOVA to analyze the RTs. The results revealed an interaction of load type and practice, F(1.88, 97.86) = 3.99, p = .02, \u03b7p2 = .07. It indicated that the gain in performance across practice was larger for single-tasking (RTs: \u0394M = 13.42 sec; \u0394SD = 8.68 sec) than for visuospatial dual-tasking (\u0394M = 9.04 sec; \u0394SD = 8.21 sec) as shown in Fig 4A. Furthermore, there was a main effect of practice, F(1.93, 100.34) = 104.71, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .67, but no significant effect of load type, F(1, 52) = 1.33, p = .25, \u03b7p2 = .03.Performance of Origami folding task.(A) RTs and (B) error rates of Origami folding task (Task 1) when paired with different variants of the memory load (i.e., cognitive verbal, cognitive visuospatial, motoric isochronous tapping, motoric non-isochronous tapping, and none).The separate ANOVA on error rate showed no interaction of load type \u00d7 practice, F(2.42, 125.89) = 0.70, p = .53, \u03b7p2 = .01, but a main effect of load type, F(1, 52) = 8.14, p = .006, \u03b7p2 = .14, suggesting participants made more errors when folding Origami with the cognitive visuospatial secondary task than when folding Origami alone (see Fig 4B). The main effect of practice again showed the strong training effect, F(1.90, 98.99) = 28.39, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .35.Origami folding with cognitive verbal memory load vs. no loadWe analyzed RTs in the Origami folding task with a 2 load types (cognitive verbal memory load vs. no load) \u00d7 4 levels of practice repeated-measures ANOVA. We found neither a main effect of load type nor an interaction effect of load type \u00d7 practice, Fs < 1. Only a main effect of practice was revealed, F(1.61, 83.70) = 118.33, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .70. Similarly, the ANOVA on error rate did not show any effect of load type and any interaction of load type \u00d7 practice, Fs < 1.38, but only a main effect of practice, F(1.50, 77.83) = 23.44, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .31. The results did not suggest any significant difference in Origami folding with a concurrent verbal memory load compared to without memory load.Origami folding with motoric isochronous tapping memory load vs. no loadWe analyzed RTs in the Origami folding task in a 2 load types (motoric isochronous tapping memory load vs. no load) \u00d7 4 levels of practice repeated-measures ANOVA. We found an interaction effect of load type \u00d7 practice, F(1.90, 98.97) = 67.23, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .56, suggesting RTs were reduced more in the single-task condition across the four practice trials than in the motoric isochronous tapping dual-tasking condition (RTs: \u0394M = 10.37 sec; \u0394SD = 9.26 sec). Furthermore, there were main effects of load type, F(1, 52) = 328.76, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .86, and of practice, F(1.91, 99.33) = 65.37, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .56.The ANOVA on error rates for the Origami folding task revealed no interaction of load type \u00d7 practice, F(2.36, 122.94) = 2.69, p = .06, \u03b7p2 = .05, but main effects of load type, F(1, 52) = 4.60, p = .04, \u03b7p2 = .08, and practice, F(1.71, 89.10) = 20.76, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .29.Origami folding with motoric non-isochronous tapping memory load vs. no loadThe ANOVA on RTs with 2 load types (motoric non-isochronous tapping memory load vs. no load) \u00d7 4 levels of practice repeated-measures ANOVA revealed only a main effect of practice, F(2.06, 107.19) = 103.69, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .67. No other effect was found, load type and load type \u00d7 practice, Fs < 1.76. The estimated Bayes factor (alternative/null) for the interaction suggested that the data were .056:1 in favor of the null hypothesis, or rather, 17.84 times more likely to occur under the model excluding an effect for load type and practice, rather than the model with it. The ANOVA on error rate showed the main effects of load type, F(1, 52) = 6.50, p = .01, \u03b7p2 = .11, and practice, F(2.22, 115.24) = 21.53, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .29, as well as the interaction effect, F(1.98, 103.03) = 3.21, p = .05, \u03b7p2 = .06. It indicated that participants made more errors when performing and learning Origami folding with concurrent isochronous tapping secondary task.DiscussionThe main purpose of this study was to compare how different variants of memory load affect performance in Origami folding and acquisition of Origami folding (change in performance through practice on a specific figure). The experiment reported here therefore concerned the interaction of load type and practice. Such an interaction was obtained when comparing Origami folding with (1) the cognitive visuospatial memory load vs. no memory load as well as when comparing (2) motoric isochronous tapping memory load with the no memory load baseline, which confirmed Hypothesis 1. In line with theories suggesting that learning operates on the level that (at a given point in practice) demands the most control [cf. ], we did not observe cases where a dual-task variant influenced performance while it did not affect learning (i.e. change in performance), and thus confirmed Hypothesis 2.Visuospatial resourceBased on Baddeley, a dual-task paradigm with a memory load task was employed to test whether the execution vs. acquisition of Origami folding shared resources in the phonological loop or in visuospatial sketchpad. Indeed, an interaction of load type and practice (RTs) was revealed when participants performed Origami folding with cognitive visuospatial secondary task. It suggests a decremental effect in visuospatial sketchpad on acqusition rather than on execution of Origami folding when paired with visuospatial secondary task. One potential explanation is that the cognitive process of Origami folding involves the visuospatial sketchpad and taxing this representation via a secondary task compromises control-based learning [cf. ]. During the process of converting the two-dimensional instructions to a three-dimensional object, many spatial concepts are involved, such as in mountain folding, front side of the paper, creases, and motion arrows. Moreover, evidence has shown that sequential skill learning relies essentially on error detection and error correction. While spatial working memory is demanded for processing motor errors and updating motor control, the visuospatial resources in the visuospatial sketchpad are needed for sequential skill learning.In contrast, the cognitive verbal secondary task showed neither a main effect of load type nor an interaction of load type and practice. Previous studies on implicit sequence learning have shown that an auditory (auditory-verbal) task can significantly interfere with the acquisition of a sequential skill in a spatial (visual-manual\u2014screen locations to key locations) task. Moreover, Tenbrink and Taylor stated that while folding participants reformulate and reconceptualize the instruction in their own words or thoughts to conduct the movements. The pictorial information can be transformed into code held in the phonological loop to ease the load in the pictorial channel by inference-making [cf. ]. Presumably, after seeing the picture of one folding step, some participants used their own words explaining which action they should perform. However, in the current study, we did not observe detrimental effects of verbal memory load on sequence learning task. Potentially, our taxing of memory load in the verbal task was only mild. We required participants to recognize the change of one letter in a list of three letters. Further studies should be conducted with more challenging verbal secondary tasks.Timing resourceBased on the Multiple Resource Theory, our dual-task paradigm examined potential resource conflicts of cognitive vs. motor control in Origami folding. Tapping should tax motor control. Indeed, the analyses of Origami completion times showed a main effect of load type and an interaction effect of load type and practice in Origami folding with isochronous tapping secondary task. In contrast, neither a main effect nor an interaction was revealed when Origami folding was paired with non-isochronous tapping secondary tasks. It suggested only the impairment of executing as well as learning Origami folding, while holding the isochronous rhythmic patterns in mind. According to Povel, participants attempt to perceive and estimate the rhythmic tempi in internal clock with isochronous temporal patterns. Yet when reproducing non-isochronous rhythmic patterns, the internal clock cannot be generated and people tend to resort to the organizing principles of assimilation and distinction. They assimilate similar temporal patterns toward 1:1 ratio. When the temporal patterns distinguish like 2:3, they tend to categorize the patterns into long/short ratios. For instance, rhythmic patterns with 3:2:2 ratio (e.g., 900ms, 600ms, and 600ms) tend to be reproduced with a long/short/short ratio of 2:1:1. In short, it is conceivable that absolute timing mechanism were activated when participants tapped isochronous patterns. The relative timing mechanism were activated when participants tapped non-isochronous patterns. The analyses on error rates of the tapping secondary task in S2 Table in S1 Appendix supported the argument that participants employed different timing strategies in tapping tasks. When considering absolute timing (self-produced IRIs in variance of 20% of the absolute IOIs) as correct trials, participants made much more errors in the motoric non-isochronous tapping secondary task compared to the motoric isochronous tapping secondary task (90.9% vs. 61.6%). In contrast, when considering relative timing (self-produced IRIs in variance of 20% of the relative IOI ratios), error rates did not show any difference between the isochronous vs. non-isochronous tapping task (64.3% vs. 54.3%). Isochronous rhythmic patterns can be perceived, memorized and reproduced via absolute timing mechanism, whereas non-isochronous rhythmic patterns via relative timing mechanism. As sequential skills involve accurate timing in movement, it might be the case that the absolute timing mechanism in the internal clock is needed for executing and learning of Origami folding. When performing Origami folding with isochronous tapping, the absolute timing mechanism is overload, leading to impairments in execution and acquisition of Origami folding.Acquisition vs. performance in origami foldingTaken together, this study did not show a general memory load effect shared across all types of dual-tasking, but rather indicated load effects for specific conditions on folding performance and its change with practice. Interestingly, a concurrent visuospatial secondary task had detrimental effects on learning rather than on performing Origami folding. In line with the previous studies, selective memory load does not necessarily affect execution vs. acquisition of sequential skills to the same extent. Yet, in line with theories suggesting that learning operates on the level that (at a given point in practice) demands the most control [cf. ], there was no case of a memory load leading to a main effect of load, but no interaction of load and practice in folding time.We studied the acquisition of a sequential skill under memory load and observed strong training effects in Origami folding task across practice trials. Accordingly, memory should have been taxed less and less across trials by the Origami folding task. To the extent that participants became more proficient in the primary task, more memory resources should have been left for the secondary task. However, according changes in performance in the secondary task were only observed for the cognitive verbal secondary task, which showed a strong improvement from Trial 1 to Trial 4, although participants received different letter triplets each time (see S2 Table in S1 Appendix). Given that this dual-task variant had no impact on Origami folding, this pattern might reflect quick practice gains in this secondary task rather than that resources freed in the primary task (Origami folding) were used for the verbal secondary task.Using Origami folding as a task, the study tested the resources that are relevant to learning a motor task through visualisation. Comparing the impact of different dual-task variants on practice gains in folding suggested that resources involved in isochronous timing and in visual imagery were indeed relevant. Given that we studied the early part of skill acquisition (rather than automatization of motor patterns across many sessions of pratice), it seems reasonable that task performance and learning were mainly guided by visual representations. In line with the theory of Willingham on the connection of learning and motor control, participants might mainly rely on and learn based on visual representations early in practice, which is within the scope of our experiment. In work on sequence learning, it has been shown that participants in the early phase of practice learn the sequence based on the positions of targets and responses on screen and response panel rather than sequence of finger movements. When practice extends across many sessions, finger movements might become more relevant. Accordingly, a visual-spatial secondary task should be potentially relevant to interfere with the encoding of the sequence or retrieving of the encoded sequence information.As we aimed to study the early parts of acquisition of Origami folding, we tested novices as they (due to the small amount of prior knowledge) should show the largest learning gains and they should be affected the most by taxing the cognitive resources potentially relevant for acquiring the sequential skill. Using a within-subject design, we avoided that between subjects differences might confound the results. By testing participants with expertise, the potential to find out which resources are relevant for acquiring the skill (by performing different secondary tasks) might have been more limited, as they might rely on many (sub)processes that are automatized and are no longer affected by taxing the resources by a secondary task. In future studies, data from longer practice phases in novices might be complemented with expert performance to pin down the extent to which cognitive resources that are necessary to control the hierarchical skill of Origami folding are subject to practice-related change.In line with previous studies dealing with acquisition of sequential skill through using Origami, the current study suggests that Origami folding can be a potential task to measure sequence learning. First, it shares common characters of sequential skills, which cosists of series of actions following certain sequences. Participants receive step-by-step instructions and they should read, reformulate, reconceptualize and evaluate while folding [cf. ]. This can show in time demands. For instance, the longest folding time was observed for Step 6 of Penguin (see Fig 3). The instruction for this step was to \u201cfold the corners under the inside part of the wings\u201d. Participants should fold the corners first inside and then put them under the wings. This involved motor imagery to off-line simulate the action and execute the action. The illustration suggests that Origami folding is thus much more challenging compared to other lab tasks on sequence learning. Second, although many people have basic experience in folding cranes or planes, we still observed substantial improvements of Origami folding between Trial 1 and 4 (see Fig 4). It suggests that Origami folding can be used to measure the acquisition of sequential skills.LimitationsThere are several limitations of the study. During the experiment, participants who folded the Origami wrongly were given more time and a chance to learn and practice again. One can argue that by this we took a conservative approach and potentially underestimate the learning effects (i.e., difference between Trial 1 and 4), as we helped participants to overcome large difficulties encountered early on. However, the support after errors was necessary to secure that participants would be able to complete four trials per Origami figure (rather than that some participants would give up within the first trial of a particular figure). Providing a chance to correct errors and receive support should ease frustration and motivate participants in the two-hour experiment. Furthermore, the folding difficulty among steps within the Origami figures was of high variability, leading to variance in folding time. Moreover, prior knowledge and spatial ability play important roles in performing and learning Origami folding. In the study, participants were instructed with pictures of folding steps without textual descriptions. We observed that some participants failed to understand the folding steps and behaved aggressively after the experiment. A study on comics reading documented that inexperienced comic readers had difficulty in reading picture-only comics compared to text-picture comics. Further research should be conducted to explore the influence of prior knowledge on Origami folding on comprehending text-picture instructions.More studies are needed for replication and generalization of the load effects obtained. Further studies should use a complimentary research strategy to dissociate memory load effects on practice vs. on performance by comparing three conditions. (A) a group practices with no memory load and is tested with memory load. (B) a group practices with memory load and is tested with memory load. (C) a group practices and is tested without memory load. The drawback of this strategy would be that participants in the test phase in part need to accustom to the novel situation of memory load being present, which might be an extra factor to consider. In addition, a study with (much) more than 4 trials per Origami would be useful to estimate asymptotes, as we observed still improved performance in Trial 4 compared to Trial 3 (S3 Table in S1 Appendix). Further studies should also investigate whether showing the participants a video with hand movements while folding instead of static graphs can influence the acquisition of sequential skills under memory load, as animated instructional materials for Origami folding can lead to better learning outcome than static materials [cf. ]. Perceiving information with human movement can activate the Mirror Neuron System, which seems essential to emulate the sequential skills. Besides, participants may learn the Origami folding task in a more fluent manner with animated videos compared to stage-based static graphics.ConclusionThe study presented here suggests that the acquisition of sequential skills with practice can be studied by using a real-life activity. Dual-task manipulations suggested that participants do not depend upon verbal resources when folding Origami, but seem to rely on visuospatial codes and timing for controlling performance and for learning.Supporting informationReferencesMemorizing while walking: Increase in dual-task costs from young adulthood to old ageSelective utilization of spatial working memory resources during stance postureTheories of chess skillExecutive control and working memory are involved in sub-second repetitive motor timingMental animation in the visuospatial sketchpad: Evidence from dual-task studiesEmpirical support for \u201chastening-through-re-automatization\u201d by contrasting two motor-cognitive dual tasksAge-related changes in brain activation underlying single- and dual-task performance: Visuomanual drawing and mental arithmeticAnatomically ordered tapping interferes more with one-digit addition than two-digit addition: A dual-task fMRI studyThe influence of concurrent cognitive tasks on postural sway in childrenOn the fragility of skilled performance: What governs choking under pressure?A neuropsychological theory of motor skill learningConceptual transformation and cognitive processes in origami paper foldingFunctional neuroimaging of the interference between working memory and the control of periodic ankle movement timingInstructional animations can be superior to statics when learning human motor skillsCognitive load theory, the transient information effect and e-learningHierarchical models of behavior and prefrontal functionCompatibility between observed and executed finger movements: Comparing symbolic, spatial, and imitative cuesMirroring \u2018meaningful\u2019 actions: Sensorimotor learning modulates imitation of goal-directed actionsInstructional animation versus static pictures: A meta-analysisFolding a fish, making a mushroom: The role of diagrams in executing assembly proceduresAnalogous mechanisms of selection and updating in declarative and procedural working memory: Experiments and a computational modelClear evidence for item limits in visual working memoryA reconsideration of cognitive load theoryImplicit sequence learning despite multitasking: the role of across-task predictabilityParallel response selection disrupts sequence learning under dual-task conditionsSolving the credit assignment problem: explicit and implicit learning of action sequences with probabilistic outcomesAttention and the control of posture and gait: A review of an emerging area of researchNeural simulation of action: A unifying mechanism for motor cognitionDoes motor simulation theory explain the cognitive mechanisms underlying motor imagery?

Using within-subject design, the first trial, participants were novices, but for the 2nd or 3rd and the 4th trials, whether participants have been proficient for the primary task then more memory resources have left for secondary task? Therefore, the secondary task for the 2nd , the 3rd and the 4th is not under the same situation of the 1st trial.2. Authors may cite some previous paper folding studies dealing with the acquisition of sequential skills, any papers there or this study is the first study?3. Any results comparing the folding of box, chair, frog etc.?4. Whether folding the different shapes will impose the same level of difficulty?Minor issues1. Memory load rather than memory loads --- line 492. One folding step rather than a folding step --- line 1093. Any hypotheses before conducting the experiment? --- Research Question sectionReviewer #2: Thank you for the submission. The design of the study is interesting, however, I am very confused with the aim of the study. The major reason might be that the research question and conclusion are not coherent with the methodology as well as the analysis.In the research question section, the aim was made explicitly on \u201cusing dual-task paradigm to dissociate the memory load on execution from acquisition\u201d. One would expect to see comparison between execution and acquisition. However, the actual analyses were on interaction effects between secondary task and number of trials. To be exact, the author conducted repeated measure separately on various the secondary tasks comparing the effect between with and without the secondary task on an individual students\u2019 completion time across different tasks (yet what is 4 repetition in here?). Learning time or performance is not reported at all. The author stated \u201cThere was no speed-accuracy tradeoff\u201d but it doesn\u2019t mean that the completion time is equivalent to accuracy. Also, as the author described on page 16, RT is related to the task complexity. Of course there is a main task effect in the result. Later in the conclusion, the author stated \u201cmain effect of secondary task type (indicating performance)\u201d which added even more confusion\u2026 so what are being tested?In addition to that, Line 72-73 & 77-78, added more confusion in understanding what is being tested in here. In general, how well one acquire a skill is measured by performance. However, the first statement sounds like they are two different things and thus they are being compared in this study. Then in the later statement, the author tried to compare performance with change of performance which is invalid comparison. These two statements are confusing.Other than the unclear aim, in the procedure, page 15 line 349 \u2013 358, participants who fold the Origami wrongly were given more time and chance to learn and practice again. This is NOT a fair learning condition. Thus I won\u2019t be surprised when the author claimed Line 462-464 \u201cwe did not observe cases where a dual task variant influenced performance while it did not affect learning (i.e. change in 464 performance)\u201d.Also, in the analysis (page 17), when the author wrote \u201cANOVA \u20262x4\u2026(results) revealed\u201d, I assumed this was a two-way ANOVA and was about to comment on the abnormal degree of freedom. But soon I saw Greenhouse Geisser-correction was applied, then I realised this is actually a repeated-measures ANOVA, and everything makes a lot more sense. It would be a lot clearer if the author can describe clearly right at the beginning. Furthermore, it is recommended to test the assumption of sphericity before the main analysis.In the result section, I am not surprised that there is no effect for auditory secondary task. The core of dual-task paradigm is to have a secondary task that take the same working memory resources with the primary task. Learning Origami on the screen is basically a visual task which has nothing to do with auditory loop. Moreover, I do see the value of this study if the aim of the study is to identify which secondary test would potentially affect the learning of origami (which is actually closer to the running head). The author conducted the study with different secondary task, and it\u2019s a shame that the effect of all the secondary task are not compared directly. Yet, in order to achieve this, it would require the author to rewrite (and maybe even re-analysis) the whole article with a clearer (and actually different) aim.Minor changes:Line 41 inconsistent referencing styleLine 57, change \u201cshowed a increase\u201d to \u201cshowed an increase\u201dLine 57, replace \u201cwith\u201d with \u201cwhen\u201dLine 68, \u201cvs.\u201d, do you mean \u201cand?\u201dLine 71, \u201c4 repetitions\u201d or \u201c4 attempts\u201d? The participants folded the shape 4 times, that is 3 repetitions, right? Or the participants could fold the paper while learning but that original attempt didn\u2019t count? Later in table 1 (page 13-14, line 313 ), the participants actually have to fold the same shape 5 times. This is quite confusing here. Please illustrate clearly.Line 93-109 go into methodsSection \u201cOrigami Folding Task\u201d Describe more about the machine of learning origami or sequential motor skills.

Using within-subject design, the first trial, participants were novices, but for the 2nd or 3rd and the 4th trials, whether participants have been proficient for the primary task then more memory resources have left for secondary task? Therefore, the secondary task for the 2nd, the 3rd and the 4th is not under the same situation of the 1st trial.Reply: Thank you for pointing this out. We studied acquisition of serial order under memory load and indeed memory load should have less influence the more proficient participants are with a specific Origami figure. We now mention in the Discussion that across trials working memory should be taxed less and less.2. Authors may cite some previous paper folding studies dealing with the acquisition of sequential skills, any papers there or this study is the first study?Reply: To our knowledge, our study is the first study using paper folding to examine how sequential skills are acquired through practice. We have mentioned it in the Introduction under the section Origami Folding Task as well as in the Discussion.3. Any results comparing the folding of box, chair, frog etc.?Reply: We have added the results (reaction times and error rates) comparing folding each figure in the Result section and Appendix in the manuscript (see Fig 2 and S1 Table in Appendix). 4. Whether folding the different shapes will impose the same level of difficulty?Reply: Please see the reply to Comment 3. We have added it to the Results section. Different shapes as well as different steps within a figure can impose different levels of difficulty. The different levels of difficulty might influence the effect of memory load. However, we used the design of Latin-square table, so that the different shapes are combined with all kinds of memory load. 5. Memory load rather than memory loads --- line 49Reply: We have corrected it.6. One folding step rather than a folding step --- line 109Reply: We have corrected it.7. Any hypotheses before conducting the experiment? --- Research Question sectionReply: Two hypotheses were added under the Research Question section. \u2003Response to Reviewer #21. Thank you for the submission. The design of the study is interesting, however, I am very confused with the aim of the study. The major reason might be that the research question and conclusion are not coherent with the methodology as well as the analysis.In the research question section, the aim was made explicitly on \u201cusing dual-task paradigm to dissociate the memory load on execution from acquisition\u201d. Reply: Thank you for pointing this out. We explained the research question now more clearly about and added the hypotheses. We aimed at comparing how different variants of memory load affect performance in Origami folding and change in performance across trials with practice on a specific figure. 2. One would expect to see comparison between execution and acquisition. Reply: We now acknowledge in the Discussion that further studies would use another research strategy to dissociate memory load effects on practice vs. on performance. (A) a group practices with no memory load and is tested with memory load. (B) a group practices with memory load being tested with memory load and. (C) a group practices and is tested without memory load. The drawback of this strategy would be that participants at test phase in part need to accustom to the novel situation of memory load being present, which might be an extra factor to consider.3. However, the actual analyses were on interaction effects between secondary task and number of trials. To be exact, the author conducted repeated measure separately on various the secondary tasks comparing the effect between with and without the secondary task on an individual students\u2019 completion time across different tasks (yet what is 4 repetition in here?).Reply: Thank you for pointing out the confusing term. Before the experiment, participants received the folding instruction and did not fold. During the experiment, they folded 4 times. We thus corrected the term \u201crepetition\u201d into \u201ctrial\u201d. One trial means one run of folding an Origami figure. 4. Learning time or performance is not reported at all. Reply: The learning time and error rates of Origami-folding task (T1) were reported in Table 2. The learning time or performance of each figure are added to S1 Table in Appendix. 5. The author stated \u201cThere was no speed-accuracy tradeoff\u201d but it doesn\u2019t mean that the completion time is equivalent to accuracy. Also, as the author described on page 16, RT is related to the task complexity. Of course there is a main task effect in the result. Later in the conclusion, the author stated \u201cmain effect of secondary task type (indicating performance)\u201d which added even more confusion\u2026 so what are being tested?Reply: Thank you for pointing this out. We tried to further clarify this. The main effect of task is not about the specific Origami figure it is about a kind of memory load being present vs. absent. To avoid the confusion, we have changed \u201ctask type\u201d into \u201cload type\u201d.6. In addition to that, Line 72-73 & 77-78, added more confusion in understanding what is being tested in here. In general, how well one acquire a skill is measured by performance. However, the first statement sounds like they are two different things and thus they are being compared in this study. Then in the later statement, the author tried to compare performance with change of performance which is invalid comparison. These two statements are confusing.Reply: Thank you for this comment. We tried to further clarify how we can assess skill acquisition. How well one acquires a skill can be estimated by change in performance from Trial 1 to Trial 4. It would be interesting to know how close to the asymptote participants were brought by the 4 numbers of trials that we granted the participants. We acknowledge in the Discussion that a study with (much) more than 4 trials per Origami would be useful to estimate asymptotes. In S3 Table in Appendix, there is a comparison between Trial 1 to Trial 4. As there was still an improvement from Trial 3 to Trial 4, three trials are not sufficient to reach the asymptote.7. Other than the unclear aim, in the procedure, page 15 line 349 \u2013 358, participants who fold the Origami wrongly were given more time and chance to learn and practice again. This is NOT a fair learning condition. Thus I won\u2019t be surprised when the author claimed Line 462-464 \u201cwe did not observe cases where a dual task variant influenced performance while it did not affect learning (i.e. change in 464 performance)\u201d.Reply: Indeed, one could argue that we take a conservative approach and potentially underestimate the learning effects (i.e., difference between Trial 1 and 4) as we helped participants to overcome large difficulties encountered early on. We now briefly mention in the Discussion that support after errors was necessary to secure that participants would be able to complete four trials per Origami figure (rather than that some participants would give up within the first trial of a particular figure). 8. Also, in the analysis (page 17), when the author wrote \u201cANOVA \u20262x4\u2026(results) revealed\u201d, I assumed this was a two-way ANOVA and was about to comment on the abnormal degree of freedom. But soon I saw Greenhouse Geisser-correction was applied, then I realised this is actually a repeated-measures ANOVA, and everything makes a lot more sense. It would be a lot clearer if the author can describe clearly right at the beginning. Furthermore, it is recommended to test the assumption of sphericity before the main analysis.Reply: Thank you for pointing this out. We now make our strategy of analysis more explicit upfront.9. In the result section, I am not surprised that there is no effect for auditory secondary task. The core of dual-task paradigm is to have a secondary task that take the same working memory resources with the primary task. Learning Origami on the screen is basically a visual task which has nothing to do with auditory loop. Moreover, I do see the value of this study if the aim of the study is to identify which secondary test would potentially affect the learning of origami (which is actually closer to the running head). The author conducted the study with different secondary task, and it\u2019s a shame that the effect of all the secondary task are not compared directly. Yet, in order to achieve this, it would require the author to rewrite (and maybe even re-analysis) the whole article with a clearer (and actually different) aim.Reply: Thank you for the comment. Our aim is to test the effect of memory load on performance and on learning (improvement of performance through practice) of Origami folding. We therefore compared the performance of Origami folding (with memory load vs. without memory load) in 4 trials (Trial 1 to Trial 4 through practice). In order to make the aim clearer, we explained the research aim more explicitly in the manuscript. We added an overall repeated-measures ANOVA with 4 kinds of memory load (without the condition with no memory load) and 4 trials (time course of practice from Trial 1 to 4) at the beginning of the analyses. The significant main effect suggested that there were strong differences among the memory load variants. Given that we use a collection of different WM tasks, we deem an approach combining the paired analysis (no load vs. one specific load) as most appropriate. Although learning Origami folding is a visual task, it can still interfere with auditory loop. Previous studies on implicit sequence learning (Roettger et al., 2019; Schumacher & Schwarb, 2009) have shown that an auditory (auditory-verbal) task can significantly interfere with the acquisition of a sequential skill in a spatial (visual manual \u2013 screen locations to key locations) task. In addition, Tenbrink and Taylor (2015) mentioned that while folding participants reformulate the instruction in their own words or thoughts and conduct the movements. The integrative model of text-picture integration (Schnotz, 2014) suggests pictorial information can transform into phonological loops to ease the load in the pictorial channel. However, in the current study, we did not observe such detrimental effects (of verbal memory load) on sequence learning task. It can be due to the low taxing of memory load in the verbal task. We asked participants to recognize the change of one letter in a list of 3 letters. Further studies should be conducted with more challenging verbal secondary tasks.10.

Line 68, \u201cvs.\u201d, do you mean \u201cand?\u201dReply: We have corrected \u201cvs.\u201d into \u201cand\u201d.14. Line 71, \u201c4 repetitions\u201d or \u201c4 attempts\u201d? The participants folded the shape 4 times, that is 3 repetitions, right? Or the participants could fold the paper while learning but that original attempt didn\u2019t count? Later in table 1 (page 13-14, line 313), the participants actually have to fold the same shape 5 times. This is quite confusing here. Please illustrate clearly.Reply: Thank you for pointing the confusion out. We agree that \u201crepetition\u201d is not the best term, as the participants did not fold while learning. They only read the handouts of the folding instructions with all the folding steps. Then they folded 4 times in the experiment. We changed \u201crepetitions\u201d into \u201ctrials\u201d and explicitly explained it in the abstract and the manuscript. Trial 1 refers the first run of folding one figure. Trial 2 refers to the second run of folding the same figure.15. Line 93-109 go into methodsReply: We have integrated this paragraph into methods.16. Section \u201cOrigami Folding Task\u201d Describe more about the machine of learning origami or sequential motor skills. See reference below.Reply: We have added the mechanism of learning origami or sequential motor skills to the manuscript. We have mentioned the importance of Mirror Neuron System. Thank you for the papers that were recommended.17. Line 130, for origami task, it is understandable why visuospatial sketchpad is needed as the person is required to see and read the picture. However it is not unclear why phonological loop is also needed for such a visual task. Please elaborate.Reply: Thank you for pointing it out. We have explained now more explicitly, why phonological loop can be involved. According to procedure of Origami folding (Tenbrink & Taylor, 2015), people read and reformulate the folding instructions in their own words at first. In accordance with the Integrative Model of Text-Picture Integration (Schnotz, 2014), pictorial information can be transformed from images in pictorial channel into sounds in verbal channel. When the mental representation of the instruction is constructed, the information can be traced back to verbal and pictorial information. One example would be after seeing the picture of one folding step, some participants used their own words explaining which action they should perform.18.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)Reviewer #1:\u00a0Thank for the revised version. I really appreciate the revisions, however, I still have concern about my first comment on the design issue. The level of learners' expertise may be a confounding factor in the design....Would authors like to run another experiment with between-subject design? Although authors have put my concern as limitation, but the reported experiment may have design issues given no another experiment.Reviewer #2:\u00a0Thank you for the revision.This version is made clearer that the authors are actually investigating in the type of cognitive resources rather than the cognitive load induced by learning origami. The previous version focused on the cognitive load which is a slightly different concept from resources. It is recommended to also change the keywords (and probably also the title) so not to confuse other new readers.Moreover, another question arose \u2013 was the study going to test the cognitive resources that is relevant to learning *motor task through visualisation*, or to learning *procedural skills* as the author stated multiple times? If the aim is the first one, then the experimental setting makes sense.

Thank for the revised version. I really appreciate the revisions, however, I still have concern about my first comment on the design issue. The level of learners' expertise may be a confounding factor in the design....Would authors like to run another experiment with between-subject design? Although authors have put my concern as limitation, but the reported experiment may have design issues given no another experiment.Reply: Thank you for pointing out the potential benefits of a study involving experts. As we were to study the (early parts of) acquisition of Origami folding, we tested novices as they (due to lack of prior knowledge) should show the largest learning gains and they should be affected the most by taxing the cognitive resources potentially relevant for acquiring the sequential skill. By testing participants with expertise, the potential to find out which resources are relevant for acquiring the skill (by trying different secondary tasks) might have been more limited. Experts might rely on many (sub)processes that are automatized (i.e., no longer affected by taxing the resources by a secondary task). Given that we used a within-subjects design and we largely avoided that between subjects differences might confound our results. Nevertheless, combining a study on (early) practice in Origami folding with an expert-novice comparison seems a promising route for a future study. We have added the suggestion in the discussion.Response to Reviewer #21. This version is made clearer that the authors are actually investigating in the type of cognitive resources rather than the cognitive load induced by learning origami. The previous version focused on the cognitive load which is a slightly different concept from resources. It is recommended to also change the keywords (and probably also the title) so not to confuse other new readers.Reply: Thank you for pointing this out. \u201cMemory load\u201d can be misleading, as we used variants of memory loads to tax specific resources. We have changed the keyword of \u201cmemory load\u201d into \u201ccognitive resources\u201d. The title has been changed from \"Origami folding: Memory load effects on acquisition of sequential skills\" to \"Origami folding: Taxing resources necessary for the acquisition of sequential skills\".2. Moreover, another question arose \u2013 was the study going to test the cognitive resources that is relevant to learning *motor task through visualisation*, or to learning *procedural skills* as the author stated multiple times? If the aim is the first one, then the experimental setting makes sense. The secondary tasks were visuospatial-related that were relevant to the learning tasks (i.e. motor tasks) and the learning means (i.e. visualisations). Moreover, the author stated a multiple time in the article and also in the reply to the first author that the aim is to study the learning of procedural skills. Then in the experimental setting, the secondary task should be procedural- or sequential- related. That means the secondary tasks should be some tasks that might hinder participants from memorising the correct sequence. Otherwise the conclusion would not follow from the design. This is also the reason why I put \"I don't know\" about the rigour of the statistical analysis, as the analysis method largely follows from the study aim and hypothesis.Reply: Thank you for the comment. We took care to make clear that we assume that visual representations are essential in the skill acquisition we are studying. We now avoid framing this as a procedural skill. We used a secondary task interfering with the visuospatial sketchpad. Given that we study the early part of skill acquisition (rather than automation of motor patterns), it seems reasonable that task performance and learning are mainly guided by visual representations. In line with the theory by Willingham (1998) on the connection of learning and motor control, participants might mainly rely on (and learn based on) visual representations early in practice (i.e. within the scope of our experiment). In work on sequence learning, it has been shown that participants (at least early in practice) learn about which target in space to affect in which order (sequence of positions rather than sequence of finger movements; cf. Willingham et al. 2000). When practice extends across many sessions, finger movements might become more relevant. According to this reasoning, a visual spatial secondary task should be especially potent to interfere with encoding the sequence or retrieving encoded sequence information.4. Also, authors replied to the first reviewer that this is the first study \u2013 maybe it\u2019s true when looking at learning origami under repetitive practices; but it\u2019s definitely not the first study dealing with acquisition of sequential skill through looking at origami (see the reference that I recommended before).Reply: Thank you very much for the comment. We have edited this and include these studies. 5. In this revised version, there are still some issues with sentence structures. For example, line 52 \u201cwhen participants concurrently solve[ing] a cognitive memory load task\u201d What is a cognitive memory load task? Cognitive memory load is not an adjective. What type of tasks that you are referring to? Another example in line 55 \u201cYet an impact of load on performance does not necessarily imply an impact on learning (i.e., improvement of performance across trials with practice)\u201d i.e. (id est) means \u201cin other words, such as\u201d.

We identified an extracellular protein, biglycan, as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in TNBC.IntroductionBreast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women worldwide. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.  Biglycan correlates biological features and clinical outcomesThe correlation between BGN and immune features. a, Heatmap showing the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes. b, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and ESTIMATE stromal and immune scores. c, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and CIBERSORT-derived immune cell scores. Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

Cancer cells induce activation of normal fibroblasts to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. A better understanding of these interactions could lead to new, targeted therapies for cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To overcome limitations of standard monolayer cell cultures and xenograft models that lack tumor complexity and/or human stroma, we have developed a high throughput tumor spheroid technology utilizing a polymeric aqueous two-phase system to conveniently model interactions of CAFs and TNBC cells and quantify effects on signaling and drug resistance of cancer cells. We focused on signaling by chemokine CXCL12, a hallmark molecule secreted by CAFs, and receptor CXCR4, a driver of tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. Using three-dimensional stromal-TNBC cells cultures, we demonstrate that CXCL12 - CXCR4 signaling significantly increases growth of TNBC cells and drug resistance through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Despite resistance to standard chemotherapy, upregulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling sensitizes TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids to specific inhibitors of these kinase pathways. Furthermore, disrupting CXCL12 - CXCR4 signaling diminishes drug resistance of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroid models. This work illustrates the capability to identify mechanisms of drug resistance and overcome them using our engineered model of tumor-stromal interactions.",

We focused on signaling by chemokine CXCL12, a hallmark molecule secreted by CAFs, and receptor CXCR4, a driver of tumor progression and metastasis in TNBC. Using three-dimensional stromal-TNBC cells cultures, we demonstrate that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling significantly increases growth of TNBC cells and drug resistance through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Despite resistance to standard chemotherapy, upregulation of MAPK and PI3K signaling sensitizes TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids to specific inhibitors of these kinase pathways. Furthermore, disrupting CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling diminishes drug resistance of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroid models. This work illustrates the capability to identify mechanisms of drug resistance and overcome them using our engineered model of tumor-stromal interactions.INTRODUCTIONSignaling between cancer cells and tumor stroma drives all stages of cancer initiation and progression. Histological examinations of human tumors show greater stromal content in more advanced and larger tumors, and high content of stromal cells correlates with greater risk of relapse and reduced survival. Fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cell type in epithelial tumors. Cancer cells dynamically activate surrounding fibroblasts to produce growth factors, hormones, and cytokines that fuel tumor growth, and facilitate progression to metastasis. These activated fibroblasts, termed carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulate cancer cells through paracrine signaling and direct intercellular interactions. In a study of breast carcinoma, about 80 percent of fibroblasts exhibited an activated phenotype.Production of the chemokine CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1) is a hallmark feature of CAFs. CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors upregulated on cancer cells, and activates multiple molecular pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Signaling through these pathways promotes survival, proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer cells. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4/CXCR7 signaling axis is highly active in breast cancers. Analysis of human breast tumors showed that among the different molecular subtypes, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells have the most elevated expression of CXCR4. Considering the lack of targeted therapies for TNBC, disrupting this chemokine signaling may offer a potential new therapeutic approach. In addition, investigating pathways downstream of this chemokine signaling axis in TNBC cells potentially will unveil new molecular targets for therapy.Studies of interactions among stroma and cancer cells typically use monolayer cell cultures or xenograft models. Monolayer cultures lack the complexity of tumors including a compact three-dimensional morphology, close intercellular contacts, exposure of cells to gradients of soluble factors and oxygen, and non-uniform, spatially-dependent cell proliferation. Thus, cells in monolayer cultures often fail to reproduce key characteristics of tumors. Xenografts present a physiological system for cancer research. However, they are limited in terms of absence of human tumor stroma, failure of some murine cytokines to activate human receptors, disparities in dynamics of tumor growth and progression compared to human tumors, and need for complex tools and biological assays to study stromal effects on cancer cells. Since the introduction of tissue microarrays and next generation sequencing, these technologies have been used for high throughput assessment of biomarkers in thousands of tumor samples from biopsies using standard assays such as immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridization. These technologies are an invaluable tool in clinical oncology to develop diagnostic tests and identify disease biomarkers. Nevertheless, tissue microarrays and similar biopsy-based assays for endpoint analysis of fixed samples do not capture dynamic tumor-stromal interactions in tumor microenvironments. Tumors constantly transform both spatially and temporally. Interactions between stromal and cancer cells play a major role in conferring functional changes to cancer cells such as gain of cancer stem cell and mesenchymal characteristics, altered metabolism, drug resistance, migration and invasion, and survival. Mechanistic understanding of these complex events in tumors requires approaches that reproduce dynamic signaling of cancer and stromal cells as it occurs in native tissues.Three-dimensional (3D) cultures of cells as spheroids provide relevant in vitro tumor models to recapitulate architecture and complex intercellular network of tumors and emulate stromal-cancer cells interactions. We recently developed a robotic, high throughput spheroid microprinting technology to mass produce homogenously-sized spheroids that exhibit key biology properties of solid tumors. Here, we utilized this technology and formed an array of co-culture spheroids of TNBC and stromal cells to examine CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on TNBC cells. Using different cellular assays and molecular analyses, we demonstrated that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling significantly increases spheroid proliferation and TNBC cell growth. This signaling conferred resistance to standard chemotherapy drug treatment through activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. We found that CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling induces sensitivity of the cancer cells to specific molecular inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways, preventing proliferation of TNBC cells. This work establishes the feasibility of studying tumor-stromal interactions using our engineered solid tumor models and offers a convenient preclinical tool to identify new treatment approaches.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) microprinting of TNBC-stromal cells co-culture spheroidsThe ATPS technology facilitates partitioning of cancer and stromal cells to the DEX phase nanodrop to spontaneously form a mono-culture or a co-culture spheroid within 24\u201348 hours of incubation (Figure 1A\u20131B). Importantly, nutrients and waste products of cells freely diffuse between the DEX phase nanodrop and the immersion PEG phase. Adapting the technology to robotics enabled formation of spheroids in standard 384-microwell plates. For co-culture spheroids, we selected a ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells and a total cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells/0.3 \u03bcl of DEX phase drop. This ratio was to mimic more advanced and larger human breast tumors that have greater stromal content than cancer cells. Using larger ratios of 1:3 and 1:4 (breast cancer cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial breast cancer cell density constant at 5 \u00d7 103 cells per DEX phase drop did not alter growth of TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure 1), consistent with other studies. This microprinting approach gave consistently-sized mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (5 \u00d7 103 cells), mono-culture spheroids of fibroblast cells, HMF and CAFs, (1 \u00d7 104 cells), and co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF cells or CAFs (1.5 \u00d7 104 cells with a 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells ratio) (Figure 1C). The spheroid size consistency was measured from two separate experiments to ensure that spheroids of each model had a similar initial metabolic activity baseline. Importantly, the 1.5 \u00d7 104 cell density co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells or CAFs were not statistically different in size (p > 0.05), eliminating potential effects of size differences of the spheroids on the studies reported below. We conveniently maintained spheroids in the same 384-microwell plate used for spheroid formation by robotic exchange of culture medium.(A\u2013B) Cancer cells remain confined in the 0.3 \u00b5l DEX phase drop (purple) suspended in the immiscible immersion PEG phase (pink) and autonomously aggregate to form a co-culture spheroid of triple negative breast cancer cells (green) and human mammary fibroblasts (red) in 48 hrs. Colors in panel (A) are for presentation purpose only. (C) Resulting spheroids of different co-culture models are consistently sized with low standard errors.Effect of TNBC-stromal cells signaling on cellular metabolic activity of spheroidsTo investigate the effect of CXCL12 signaling through CXCR4 and/or CXCR7 receptors on the proliferation of cells in 3D cultures, we generated eight different co-culture spheroids that contained at least one element of this chemokine-receptor(s) signaling or completely lacked them: (i) TNBC:HMF, (ii) TNBC:CAFs, (iii) CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, (iv) CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, (v) CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, (vi) CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, (vii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and (viii) CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. The co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF that lacked this signaling served as the global negative control. Spheroids were evaluated for their cellular proliferation over a six-day period following formation and in medium containing only 1% FBS at the starting point and no renewal (Figure 2A). The TNBC:CAFs model displayed either a lower or fairly similar activity compared to the TNBC:HMF model, indicating that CXCL12 production by CAFs does not confer growth advantage to TNBC cells lacking the cognate receptors of the chemokine. On the other hand, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model showed overall the highest and continuously increasing activity throughout the culture compared to all the other co-culture spheroids. The CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model also consistently showed 11\u201328% greater activity than its CXCR4+TNBC:HMF counterpart lacking the CXCL12 chemokine as determined by a linear regression analysis. There was no significant difference between cell proliferation in CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids. Interestingly, these models even had lower activity level than the TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs spheroids on each day of measurement. When the effect of expression of both CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cell proliferation was evaluated, the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs model had slightly increased activity, up to 4.5%, than the CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF spheroids on certain days. Our statistical analysis of the multivariate, temporally-dependent data resulting from all eight co-culture spheroid models showed that cell proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was significantly different from the seven other models across the six-day culture period (Figure 2B).(A) Growth of co-culture spheroids based on metabolic activity measurements is shown over a six-day period. Spheroids consist of 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells at a ratio of 1:2 TNBC:fibroblasts at the starting point of experiments. (B) p-values from a statistical test show that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model is consistently and significantly more proliferative than all the other models.Consistent with reports in mouse models, our finding suggests that the CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 axis is a key mediator of cell proliferation in breast cancer. The effect of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling on promoting primary and metastatic breast tumor growth has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. Several studies have reported that CXCR7 is a scavenger receptor to prevent saturation of CXCR4 receptors and also to create CXCL12 gradients to facilitate migration of CXCR4+ cancer cells. This provides a plausible explanation for the similar activity levels of the CXCR7+TNBC:HMF and CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs co-culture models. We note that the role of the CXCR7 receptor in the presence of CXCL12 signaling remains disputed. For example, studies show that CXCR7 expression lead to growth of primary breast tumors in rat models through promoting angiogenesis, which is consistent with data showing upregulation of this receptor on tumor vasculature. However, results from these studies cannot be correlated with those from our 3D cultures that represent models of avascular tumors. Altogether, these data demonstrate that our 3D cultures recapitulate growth properties of breast tumors. Based on analysis of the data, we selected the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and its respective negative control, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, for mechanistic studies of CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling in TNBC.Inhibition and stimulation of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingWe conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate if the higher proliferative activity of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was indeed due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXLC12 signaling. The experiments included an inhibition test and a stimulation test. First, we treated spheroids with AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 that blocks the CXCR4 receptor. Consistently throughout the six-day culture, this treatment reduced proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model that lacks CXCL12 (Figure 3A). Next, we treated the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium of CAFs. This stimulation elevated the proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model to the level of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 3B). In both cases, our analysis showed minimal statistically significant differences between the treated and non-treated co-culture models. Collectively, these results established that greater proliferation of the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model than the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroid model was due to CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling.(A) Treatment of CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids with AMD3100 (CXCR4 antagonist) normalizes proliferation to level of the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture. (B) Treating CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium from CAFs stimulates proliferation to that of CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids.Evaluation of cancer cell growth in spheroids due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signalingThe above study based on metabolic activity of cells provided a measure of stromal-cancer cells signaling effect on the overall growth of spheroids. Considering that activated stromal cells (CAFs) in breast tumors also proliferate, we investigated to what extent greater overall growth results from proliferation of CXCR4+ TNBC cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids compared with other spheroid models shown in Figure 2A. Measurements of the endogenous eGFP signal of the cancer cells showed that cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display a statistically significant (p < 0.05) growth increase throughout the measurement window (Figure 4A). Linear regression analysis showed that CXCR4+TNBC cells in this model had an 11.4% larger growth slope over time than their counterparts in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. This indicates that CAFs confer increasingly greater proliferative activity to the breast cancer cells. To validate this result, we evaluated growth of cancer cells in co-culture spheroids of TNBC:HMF and TNBC:CAFs that lacked both elements of the signaling axis or CXCR4 receptor expression, respectively. Despite some random differences in growth of cancer cells between the two models on several days, the slope of linear regression was smaller by 2% in the co-culture containing CAFs (Figure 4B). Thus, these results established the role of CXCR4 \u2013 CXCL12 signaling on enhanced growth of breast cancer cells.Proliferation of TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids measured using their endogenous eGFP signal(A) TNBC cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model display consistently greater proliferation compared to spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture model and CXCR4+TNBC single culture with a larger slope of 11.4% and 77.1%, respectively. (B) TNBC cells lacking CXCR4 expression in co-culture with HMF and CAFs show a similar proliferation. (C\u2013D) Morphology of resulting co-culture spheroids and mono-culture spheroids of breast cancer cells on days 1, 3, and 6 (left to right). Error bars represent standard error of mean. (E\u2013F) Confocal images of the co-culture spheroids containing HMF cells on day 4. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.TNBC cells in all four co-culture spheroid models displayed a larger growth than their respective mono-culture spheroids generated with the same density of 5 \u00d7 103 breast cancer cells. The slope of linear regression of growth curves was 5.0 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and TNBC:CAFs co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. Similarly, the regression line slope was 4.4 folds and 1.8 folds larger for the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and TNBC:HMF co-culture models relative to their mono-culture breast cancer cell spheroids, respectively. This implies a major role for heterotypic cellular signaling in tumors and suggests that breast cancer cells induce the normal fibroblasts to produce soluble factors to promote growth of malignant cells. Studies show that cancer cells produce growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) that activate the adjacent stromal cells, which in turn secrete signaling molecules such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to promote proliferation of cancer cells. The larger growth rate of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids compared to the respective CXCR4+TNBC mono-culture spheroids may be mediated by soluble factors secreted by CXCR4-expressing cancer cells to transform HMF cells to CAFs.Morphologically, mono-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and TNBC became more compact by day six of culture. Co-culturing breast cancer cells and fibroblasts significantly enhanced compactness of spheroids earlier, indicating that fibroblasts facilitate spheroid formation of breast cancer cells (Figure 4C\u20134D). The co-culture models containing CXCR4+TNBC cells exhibited a compact morphology for several days with minimal increases of volume (9\u201315%) from days 1 to 3. But over time, the co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC and HMF cells showed separation of fibroblast and cancer cells with an 82% volume increase from days 3 to 6. This is likely due to the expression of incompatible junctional proteins in breast cancer and fibroblast cells. For example, it was shown that intercellular adhesion was dependent on cadherins expression of each cell type, and only cells that expressed the same type of cadherins intermixed. Notably, the separation behavior was observed considerably more in the TNBC:HMF co-culture model and was further demonstrated through confocal imaging in Figure 4E\u20134F. Expression of CXCR4 on TNBC cells largely prevented separation from HMF cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF model. Additionally, inclusion of CAFs, regardless of CXCR4 expression on TNBC cells, blocked the segregation effect and helped the spheroids retain a compact morphology, mimicking the unique characteristic of CAFs to infiltrate tumor masses. All spheroids displayed shedding of TNBC cells from their peripheries on later days of culture, suggesting that active proliferation of border cells is somewhat compensated by cell shedding. We note that a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these morphological differences in co-culture spheroids requires a more extensive analysis.Molecular analysis of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on cancer cell proliferation in spheroidsWe evaluated proliferation of both breast cancer and stromal cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids using IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids and quantifying Ki-67+ proliferative cells. Breast cancer and stromal cells showed statistically significant higher proliferation (p < 0.05) in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 5). When co-cultured with CAFs, the CXCR4+TNBC cells showed 1.4 times greater Ki-67 staining, in agreement with results based on eGFP signal measurements (Figure 4). Additionally, CAFs in the co-culture model had a remarkably two-fold higher Ki-67 staining compared to HMF cells. This is consistent with increased proliferation of CAFs in tumor tissues, and the overall greater stromal content in more aggressive and larger tumors. We note that the CAFs secrete mCherry-tagged CXCL12 into the medium, whereas the HMF cells contain mCherry signal in their nuclei. This is the reason for visual differences between the red fluorescence images of CAFs and HMF cells in Figure 5. To avoid relying on the mCherry signal for quantification of cell proliferation, we used the Ki-67+ and eGFP signal of breast cancer cells to quantify proliferative TNBC cells, and then subtracted this value from the total Ki-67+ fluorescence to quantify proliferation of stromal cells (CAFs or HMF) in their respective co-cultures.Proliferation of CXCR4+TNBC cells and fibroblasts (HMF and CAFs) in co-culture spheroids characterized through measurements of Ki-67+ proliferative cells using immunostained images of cryosections of 4-day old spheroids. Both cancer cells and fibroblasts show significantly greater proliferation in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model (blue bars). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Next, we investigated molecular mechanisms for increased proliferation of stromal and breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroid model. The CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 axis may activate multiple pathways in cancer cells. We focused on ERK and AKT, two prominent drivers of proliferation in breast cancer and other malignancies. Western blot analysis relative to the total protein and \u03b2-actin expression of each co-culture system showed that cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids had moderately higher levels of p-ERK (Figure 6A) and substantially higher levels of p-AKT (Figure 6B) compared to CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. The displayed immunoblots were quantified (normalized to their respective total and \u03b2-actin protein expressions), showing an 81% increase in the p-AKT/t-AKT levels and a 16% increase in p-ERK/t-ERK levels in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs spheroids. Although p-ERK increase is modest, small changes in activation of MAPK components produce much larger effects on overall signaling and biologic outputs. These results suggest that the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling upregulates activation of the PI3K and MAPK pathways to support TNBC cells metabolic and growth activities.Western blot analysis of signaling proteins (A) p-ERK and (B) p-AKT in co-cultures of CXCR4+TNBC cells with HMF and CAFs. Quantified data were normalized to \u03b2-actin protein expression.To further substantiate these results, we conducted IHC analysis of cryosections of co-culture spheroids for ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 7A\u20137B, 7D\u20137E). Quantification of immunostained sections (normalized to total protein expression and highest fluorescent value obtained) showed a similar pattern to Western blotting with a 52% and 28% increase in p-AKT/t-AKT and p-ERK/t-ERK levels, respectively, in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (Figure 7C, 7F). We note that high levels of ERK and AKT at the periphery of immunostained sections is due to the positioning of CXCR4+TNBC cells at the periphery of the co-culture spheroids. Fibroblasts were mainly distributed in the center of the sections and showed minimal staining, clear from the composite image in Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Movie 1. Therefore, quantification was only performed on the CXCR4+TNBC cells of stained sections.Cryosections of co-culture spheroids of CXCR4+TNBC cells (green) with HMF and CAFs immunostained for (A\u2013B) ERK and (D\u2013E) AKT. A blue fluorescent secondary antibody was used to detect ERK and AKT. Images represent spheroids on day 4 of culture. Quantification showed higher (C) ERK and (F) AKT phosphorylation in the CXCR4+TNBC cells when co-cultured with CAFs. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.Drug sensitivity of stromal-cancer cells co-culture spheroidsBiochemical interactions of activated stromal cells and cancer cells are suggested as a major cause of drug resistance. To demonstrate the effect of CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling on drug response of breast cancer cells, we evaluated the sensitivity of co-culture spheroids to a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, to which TNBC patients may develop resistance. Cancer cells in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids were significantly more resistant to paclitaxel at a 0.1\u201310 nM concentration range than cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids (p < 0.01). The largest difference in cancer cell viability (36%) occurred at a drug concentration of 1 nM (Figure 8). This demonstrates the impact of activated tumor stromal cells on chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells, consistent with several other reports, and that our 3D tumor models recapitulate stromal-mediated drug resistance. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 eliminated resistance to paclitaxel of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model. This result emphasizes the potential to improve response to chemotherapy by targeting the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling.CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids (blue bars) display resistance to paclitaxel treatment but lose resistance to the drug when co-treated with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 (gray bars), similar to the negative control counterpart (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). Images reflect spheroids at the end of drug treatment period (6 days). Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.01.To understand the mechanism of paclitaxel resistance, we performed IHC analysis of cryosections of spheroids to assess ERK and AKT activity in CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF models treated with 1 nM paclitaxel. Following treatment, significantly higher phosphorylation levels of both proteins were maintained in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model (p < 0.05), indicating that resistance to paclitaxel due to the CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling is mediated by activation of these kinase pathways (Figure 9 and Supplementary Figure 3). Previous studies showed that paclitaxel resistance strongly correlated with increased activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in breast cancers, supporting our data. Upon co-treatment of spheroids with 1 \u03bcM of AMD3100, phosphorylated levels of ERK and AKT in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model treated with paclitaxel normalized to that of control CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids. These results collectively demonstrate the promising therapeutic approach of sensitizing TNBC tumors to chemotherapy treatment by disrupting the cancer-stroma signaling and its downstream pathways to overcome stroma-induced cancer cell growth and chemotherapy resistance.Immunohistochemical analysis of drug-treated spheroids indicates that increases in AKT and ERK phosphorylation levels in CXCR4+TNBC:CAF co-culture spheroids contribute to paclitaxel resistance (blue bars). Co-treatment with a CXCR4 receptor antagonist, AMD3100, lowers AKT and ERK activities (gray bars) to that observed in the paclitaxel sensitive control culture (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, orange bars). *p < 0.05.Our findings suggest that greater proliferation and drug resistance of cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model is due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling through AKT and ERK. Thus, we hypothesized that inhibition of these kinase pathways may block enhanced growth of cancer cells and compromise their viability. We treated both co-culture spheroids with specific inhibitors of MEK/ERK (PD0325901) and PI3K/AKT (PI-103) at a wide concentration range for a six-day period. Effectiveness of the inhibitors was assessed by eGFP detection of breast cancer cells in treated groups relative to their respective negative control group (no treatment) and presented as percent cell viability. We found that breast cancer cells in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model were more sensitive to PD0325901 treatment below 100 nM (Figure 10A) and PI-103 treatment below 1 \u00b5M (Figure 10B). We further confirmed the reduction in breast cancer cell viability using quantification of fluorescence images of drug-treated spheroids in Figure 10C\u201310D. The largest differences in the viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with CAFs and HMF were 23% and 27% at 1 nM of PD0325901 and 0.1 nM of PI-103, respectively. Interestingly, PI-103 at a 0.1 nM concentration reduced breast cancer cell viability in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model to 56%. This was consistent with protein expression results that showed significant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Figure 6 and 7) leads to increased growth of the breast cancer cells (Figure 4). This also agrees with a study that showed CXCL12 signaling-mediated drug resistant cancer cells became substantially more sensitive to chemotherapy through AKT inhibition. At higher concentrations, the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor is more effective and reduces the cancer cells viability to less than 10%. Overall, the results corroborate our protein expression study that showed upregulated activity of these two kinase pathways due to CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling. Although CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 can potentially activate multiple pathways in cancer cells, these results establish signaling to MAPK and PI3K pathways in TNBC cells and the promising result of targeting these pathways to improve cytotoxicity. Considering the activation of both kinase pathways due to this signaling, their simultaneous inhibition using combination treatments with specific molecular inhibitors of AKT and MAPK pathways may result in synergistic inhibition of TNBC cell growth and survival at lower drug concentrations than those with single-agent treatments. Collectively, these results strongly support the utility of our 3D tumor models for cellular and molecular studies of tumor-stromal interactions.Viability of CXCR4+TNBC cells in co-culture with HMF and CAFs treated with a MEK inhibitor, (A) PD0325901, and a PI3K inhibitor, (B) PI-103, measured using the endogenous eGFP signal of the TNBC cells.

Error bars represent standard error of mean. Scale bar is 200 \u00b5m. *p < 0.05.In conclusion, our robotic technology allowed facile generation of co-culture spheroids to conveniently study stromal-cancer (TNBC) cells interactions. We found that CXCL12 from CAFs signaled through CXCR4 on triple negative cancer cells to significantly enhance TNBC cell proliferation. Additionally, CAFs showed greater proliferation than their normal HMF counterpart. Increased proliferation of TNBC cells occurred due to activation of MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, two known effectors of CXCR4 signaling. CXCL12 \u2013 CXCR4 signaling also conferred resistance to chemotherapy. We demonstrated the potential to overcome stromal-mediated drug resistance using small molecule inhibitors of MAPK and PI3K pathways and CXCR4 signaling. Altogether, these findings highlight the power of our model system to identify promising new therapeutic strategies to improve response to therapy in TNBC. Future studies with improved tumor models should address and distinguish effects of stromal cells-deposited ECM signaling and stromal cells-mediated biochemical signaling with cancer cells on the proliferation and drug response of cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSAqueous two-phase system (ATPS) preparationTwo polymers, BioUltra polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Sigma), MW: 35 kDa, and dextran (DEX) (Pharmacosmos), MW: 500 kDa, were utilized to form an aqueous two-phase system, as described previously. Briefly, PEG and DEX were added to the complete cell culture medium at 5.0% (w/v) and 12.8% (w/v), respectively. The polymers were dissolved using a vortex mixer and then incubating in a water bath at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. The polymer solutions were then stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Prior to use, the PEG phase polymer solution was filtered by passing it through a 0.2 \u03bcm syringe filter to remove any impurities.Cell cultureThree different triple negative breast cancer cells were utilized for experiments. The cell lines were: MDA-MB-231 (labeled TNBC), MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR4 receptor (labeled CXCR4+TNBC), and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the CXCR7 receptor (labeled CXCR7+TNBC). These cells were previously stably transduced using lentiviral vectors and the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors on cancer cells was confirmed through flow cytometry. The TNBC cells were additionally stably transduced to express eGFP for detection. In addition, a human mammary fibroblast (HMF) cell line (labeled HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein was utilized. HMF cells were also stably transduced to secrete 0.75 ng/ml/hr of CXCL12-\u03b1 fused with mCherry for tracking, and the resulting cells were labeled as CAFs. CAFs extracted from breast cancer patients secreted varying amounts of CXCL12 in media ranging from 0.9 ng/ml \u2013 2 ng/ml over a 48 hr time period, depending on the patients and the tumor samples. The higher CXCL12 secretion rate of our transduced HMFs accounts for medium renewals and drug additions that consequently dilute the CXCL12 concentration in the medium. To maintain the cells in culture, they were grown in T175 flasks at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 using Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). Once a confluent monolayer formed, cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Sigma) and dissociated using 5 ml trypsin (Life Technologies) in an incubator for \u223c2 min. The cells were then neutralized with 10 ml of the complete growth medium, collected, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was aspirated, cells were resupsended in 1 ml of fresh medium, and loaded into a hemocytometer for counting.Co-culture spheroid formation using aqueous two-phase system (ATPS)A ratio of 1:2 TNBC to stromal cells was used to form co-culture spheroids that model the high stromal content often observed in larger and more advanced human breast tumors. Our initial tests with 1:3 and 1:4 ratios (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) while keeping the initial TNBC cell density constant did not make any further changes in the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, the selected ratio of 1:2 (TNBC cells to fibroblasts) was used for all the studies. To prepare for forming spheroids, 30 \u03bcl of the PEG phase solution was dispensed into each well of a 384-well plate, labeled as the destination plate. The DEX phase solution was mixed at an equal volume with a specific density of cells (1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monoculture spheroids of TNBC cells, 2 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for monocultures spheroids of HMF and CAFs, and 3 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl for co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF and TNBC-CAFs). The DEX phase solution and the cell suspension became diluted in half upon mixing resulting in a final polymer concentration of 6.4% (w/v), and densities of 5 \u00d7 103/0.3 \u03bcl TNBC cells in monoculture spheroids, 1 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl HMF cells or CAFs in monoculture spheroids, and 1.5 \u00d7 104/0.3 \u03bcl in co-culture spheroids of TNBC-HMF cells or TNBC-CAFs. A source 384-well plate was prepared by loading the wells from a single column with \u223c20 \u03bcl of the solution of mixed DEX phase and cell suspension. A robotic liquid handler (Bravo SRT, Agilent) was programmed to mix the source plate content and aspirate 0.3 \u03bcl from each well. This solution was robotically dispensed as a single drop into each well of the destination plate containing the PEG phase. This process was repeated for all columns of the destination plate. After completion, the destination plate was placed in an incubator to allow cells to aggregate into a single spheroid in each well within 48 hrs. Our studies used a total of eight co-culture models: TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC: HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs. Images of co-culture spheroids were captured using an inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) equipped with a high-resolution camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss).Robotic media exchange of co-culture spheroidsAfter forming spheroids, the cell culture medium in microwells was robotically exchanged to fresh medium containing only \u223c1% FBS. This was to ensure minimizing the effect of serum on cell growth and capture the effect of paracrine stromal-cancer cells signaling. The medium exchange was performed by three consecutive robotic dispensing and aspirating of 40 \u03bcl of the medium containing 1% FBS. This reduced the FBS concentration in the microwells from that of the complete growth medium to a very low level of \u223c1%. Therefore, the co-culture spheroids were maintained in \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of experiments. The medium exchange also diluted the PEG and DEX polymer concentrations and resulted in a single medium phase. The ATPS was not necessary at this point as it was only used for spheroid formation. The liquid handling protocol was optimized to avoid loss of spheroids during the process of medium exchange. Following this step, spheroids remained in 70 \u03bcl of homogenous \u223c1% FBS-containing medium for the duration of culture and without any further medium exchange.Evaluation of metabolic activity of co-culture spheroidsThe growth of co-culture spheroids was evaluated for a six-day period for all eight co-culture models using a standard PrestoBlue metabolic activity assay (Invitrogen). The PrestoBlue reagent contains a resazurin compound that is reduced by metabolically active, viable cells to resorufin detectable with standard plate readers at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. We have previously optimized the PrestoBlue assay for use with spheroid cultures. The resulting raw fluorescence data from all eight co-culture spheroids were normalized to the highest fluorescent readout obtained in the experimental data over the six-day period. Data from replicates (n = 14) of each co-culture model were then averaged and statistically evaluated to select certain co-culture models for further studies.Statistical analysis of growth of co-culture spheroidsStatistical analysis was performed on the metabolic activity of co-culture models using a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Briefly, the data represented measured signals from eight different co-culture models over six days. For each model on each day, there were 14 experimental replicates that were repeatedly used over the six-day measurement period. Therefore, we selected one-way MANOVA for data analysis to account for the temporal dependency of the daily measurements with each spheroid from a given co-culture model. The data were tested in two steps: (i) to evaluate if a co-culture model was statistically different from the other models. This was done by testing the null hypothesis that none of the co-cultures was different from the other models; and (ii) to identify if the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was statistically different from the other seven models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMFs, CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:HMF, and CXCR4+/CXCR7+TNBC:CAFs). This was done using seven pairwise comparisons to test the null hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture model was not different from the other models.The first statistical test showed significant differences among the eight co-culture models. Next, the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was selected for pairwise comparisons with the other seven models due to its higher levels of proliferation. We determined if greater proliferation in this model was statistically significant from the other co-cultures. The Bonferroni correction was utilized to control the family-wise error since this was a multiple testing problem. A significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05 was selected to determine significant differences between the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model and every other co-culture model. But \u03b1 was first modified to \u03b1/m, where m accounts for the number of hypotheses made. In this analysis, the number of hypotheses was m = 7. Therefore, a corrected significance level of 0.007 was used to reject the hypothesis that the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs model was not different from all the other seven co-cultures.For experiments that contained only two or three co-culture models presented in other sections, a student\u2019s t-test in Microsoft Excel Software or two-way ANOVA in Minitab Software was utilized with a p < 0.05 representing statistical significance.Blocking and stimulating chemokine-receptor signaling in co-culture spheroidsTo further evaluate cell proliferation due to chemokine-receptor signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs co-culture spheroids, AMD3100 (Selleckchem) was used to block the signaling and CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium was used to stimulate the signaling. A stock solution of AMD3100 was prepared in distilled, sterile water at 5 mM and stored at \u201380\u00b0C according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The desired concentration of AMD3100 was prepared by serially diluting the stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After formation of spheroids in the PEG-DEX ATPS, the medium exchange was done by adding 40 \u03bcl of AMD3100 at a 1.75 \u03bcM concentration to wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of medium. This diluted AMD3100 concentration to 1 \u03bcM. The AMD3100 solution was renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh solution of AMD3100 at a 1 \u03bcM concentration.To induce signaling in the CXCR4+TNBC:HMF co-culture spheroids, the spheroids were treated with CXCL12-containing conditioned medium collected from a confluent monolayer of CAFs. The conditioned medium was extracted from the CAFs monolayer 24 hours after seeding to ensure that it contained high levels of nutrients and growth factors. The conditioned medium was added to co-culture spheroids through medium exchange and renewed on day four by removing 50 \u03bcl of the well contents and adding 50 \u03bcl of fresh conditioned medium. Metabolic activity of co-culture spheroids following inhibition (AMD3100 treatment) or stimulation (CXCL12-\u03b1 conditioned medium treatment) was evaluated daily using PrestoBlue over the six-day culture period. Data were compared to the respective negative controls, i.e., co-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:HMF for inhibition and CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs for stimulation) that were grown in 70 \u03bcl of 1% FBS-containing media without receiving any treatment. Daily measured raw data from the co-culture models over the six-day culture were normalized to the highest fluorescent value obtained and then used for statistical tests.TNBC cell growth in co-culture spheroidsThe growth of TNBC cells in the co-culture models (TNBC:HMF, TNBC:CAFs, CXCR4+TNBC:HMF, CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs) that were selected based on the metabolic activity analysis was further confirmed by measuring the endogenous eGFP in TNBC cells using a plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The results were compared to those of the monoculture spheroids (TNBC and CXCR4+TNBC). Each model had n = 14 replicates. Data from each model were normalized to an arbitrary fluorescent value of 8000 a.u. for ease of comparison among different groups. Background fluorescence from the mCherry-expressing stromal cells in the co-culture spheroids was subtracted from the measured signal of TNBC cells. Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (Fluoview, FV1000, Olympus).Immunostaining and quantification of proliferation of co-culture spheroidsTo validate and quantify cell proliferation of co-culture spheroids, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using an established protocol. Co-culture spheroids were aspirated from microwells on day four and collected in 200 \u03bcl microcentrifuge tubes. Medium used for transferring spheroids was carefully removed from the microcentrifuge tubes and 100 \u03bcl of 4% formaldehyde was added to fix the spheroids for 10 minutes at room temperature. The spheroids were rinsed with 100 \u03bcl of PBS three times for 5 minutes to remove the formaldehyde. A 30% (w/v) sucrose solution was then added to remove water from spheroids and prevent crystal formation upon freezing. Once spheroids sank to the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes, an equal volume (100 \u03bcl) of tissue freezing medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences) was added to each tube. Samples were kept at 4\u00b0C overnight. Frozen samples were prepared the following day by flash-freezing spheroids into biopsy-sized cryomolds with dry ice. The spheroids were embedded between two thin layers of tissue freezing medium while avoiding bubble formation. The frozen molds containing the spheroids were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.A cryostat (Leica CM 1850) was used to cryosection the spheroids to 10 \u03bcm-thick slices. Only the middle sections of spheroids were collected and assessed. Each slice was transferred onto Superfrost Plus microscopic slides (Fisher). The sections were stained using a standard immunostaining protocol with primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling including the proliferative cell marker Ki-67, phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan). A blue fluorescent secondary antibody (AMCA-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used for detection to avoid interfering with the endogenous mCherry and eGFP signals in the stromal and TNBC cells, respectively. The endogenous eGFP fluorescence of TNBC cells was used to distinguish TNBC and stromal cells. An inverted fluorescent microscope (Axio Observer, Zeiss) was used to capture fluorescent images. Image processing and analysis were performed in ImageJ Software (NIH) to quantify expression of each blue-labeled protein. The TNBC cells of sections were found through binary conversion of the green channel images to select and outline only the eGFP-expressing TNBC cells. This TNBC cell outline was then overlaid on the blue channel images to measure the mean gray value of protein-expressing TNBC cells. For Ki-67 analysis, this value was then subtracted from the total mean gray value of blue channel images to determine the mean gray value of Ki-67+ stromal cells.Western blot analysis with spheroidsCo-culture spheroids (CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF) were harvested from microplates on day four and transferred into 50 mL conical tubes. After centrifuging down the samples, the supernatant was removed and spheroids were washed with PBS. Spheroids were lysed using 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer (50 mM tric-HCL, 150 mM NaCl 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4 \u00b1 0.2), a protease inhibitor (complete mini, Roche Diagnostics), and phosphatase inhibitor (Life Technologies). Spheroids were sonicated (Vibra-Cell, Sonics) twice for five seconds at a 50% amplitude level to ensure complete lysis. A BCA quantification assay kit (Life Technologies) was then used to quantify the total protein concentration extracted from spheroids. Electrophoresis and electroblotting were performed by protein addition (20 \u03bcl) onto a 4\u201315% gel (Biorad) and then gel transferring onto a nitrocellulose membrane, respectively. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Sigma) for 1 hour. Primary antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling for phospho-Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK), total-Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAPK), phospho-Akt (Ser473), and total-Akt (pan) were prepared at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, and incubated with membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. The membranes were thoroughly washed prior to and following secondary antibody treatment and detected with an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) using a FluorChem E imaging system (ProteinSimple). Quantified protein expression data were normalized to their corresponding \u03b2-actin expression.Chemotherapy drug testing with co-culture spheroidsBoth CXCR4+TNBC:CAFs and CXCR4+TNBC:HMF spheroids were subjected to (i) single treatment with a standard chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel (Selleckchem), and (ii) co-treatment with paclitaxel and AMD3100, to evaluate drug responses of TNBC cells. A stock solution of paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a 23 mM concentration and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. For single drug treatment, paclitaxel drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 2X the desired concentration. The drug solutions were added to co-culture spheroids, resulting in a total media volume of 70 \u03bcl and diluting the drug concentration in half. For co-treatment of spheroids with paclitaxel and AMD3100, drug solutions were prepared in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium at 3.5X the desired concentration and directly added (20 \u03bcl of each drug solution) to co-culture spheroids in wells already containing 30 \u03bcl of media. Paclitaxel was added at a wide range of concentrations (0.01 \u2013 1000 nM) while AMD3100 was used at a constant 1 \u03bcM concentration for co-treatments. Single-agent (paclitaxel) and co-treatment (paclitaxel and AMD3100) tests were conducted for six days. A small volume (5 \u03bcl) of concentrated AMD3100 (15 \u03bcM) was directly added to the co-treated spheroid cultures after 72 hrs of incubation to provide a fresh dose of 1 \u03bcM AMD3100. Each condition in drug treatment studies used 14 spheroids. After six days, the TNBC cell viability of drug treated co-culture spheroids was evaluated using their endogenous eGFP fluorescence. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to the respective negative control conditions (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability.Preparation of inhibitors and testing against co-culture spheroidsThe CXCR4+TNBC:HMF and CXCR4+TNBC: CAFs spheroids were treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (Selleckchem), and a PI3K inhibitor, PI-103 (Selleckchem). Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared at a 50 mM concentration in DMSO and stored at \u201380\u00b0C. The desired inhibitor concentrations for experiments were prepared by serially diluting each stock solution in 1% FBS-containing cell culture medium. After forming co-culture spheroids, the medium exchange was performed as previously described and 30 \u03bcl of an inhibitor solution (prepared at 2X desired concentration) was added to spheroids in the last renewal stage, diluting the inhibitor concentrations in half. A column of spheroids was left untreated and only received 30 \u03bcl of fresh 1% FBS-containing medium. Spheroids were incubated for 72 hrs and then treatments were renewed by direct addition of 30 \u03bcl of fresh inhibitor solutions (prepared at 1X desired concentration). The negative control conditions received 1% FBS-containing medium. The spheroids were incubated for an additional 48 hrs and viable TNBC cells in co-culture spheroids were detected using their endogenous eGFP with a plate reader. Fluorescent readouts from treatments were normalized to their respective negative controls (no treatment) to calculate CXCR4+TNBC cell viability. The results obtained from plate reading were further confirmed by fluorescent microscopy (Axio Observer, Zeiss) followed by image analysis (ImageJ, NIH).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURES AND

Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the activation of CAFs, TAMs infiltration, and lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival in TNBC patients.Conclusion: Cancer-associated fibroblasts were associated with infiltration of CD163-positive macrophages and lymphatic metastasis, and may be potential prognostic predictors of TNBC.IntroductionBreast cancer is by far the most common cause of cancer-related death for women in China. Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

IntroductionBreast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the most common amongst women. In both Canada and the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer over their lifetime. In 2019, there were a projected 1,762,450 new cases and 606,880 deaths from breast cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, over 90% were attributed to metastasis-related complications that occur when breast cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and spread to distant organ sites. Clinically, breast cancer is subdivided into four main molecular subtypes based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as the proliferative index (Ki67). These clinical molecular subtypes (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include luminal A (ER+/PR+/Ki67\u2212), luminal B (ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212/+/Ki67+), HER2-overexpressing (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER+) and basal-like/triple-negative (TN) (ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212). Bone is the most predominant site of breast cancer metastasis overall (50.7%), followed by the lung (23.9%), liver (19.7%) and brain (5.7%). Patients with better prognosis subtypes such as luminal A/B have the highest propensity for bone metastasis, a disease state that is associated with increased bone fracture, bone pain and hypercalcemia. In contrast, patients with more aggressive TN disease display an enhanced tendency to develop lung metastasis, often occurring within 5 years of the initial breast cancer diagnosis and leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Of patients with lung metastases, 60\u201370% will succumb to their disease with a median survival of 25 months and will suffer significantly due to debilitating physiological effects. This important clinical problem highlights the need to gain a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular processes that lead to lung metastasis in order to develop improved biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.Pulmonary metastasis can be influenced by both the soluble and insoluble/stromal components of the lung. The soluble component is comprised of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and we have previously identified several soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung that promote TN breast cancer metastatic behaviors such as proliferation, migration and metastatic colonization. The insoluble/stromal component of the lung is comprised primarily of ECM. In a malignant state, several of the proteins that form the ECM backbone (i.e., collagen, periostin, tenascin-c and fibronectin) are upregulated, promoting the recruitment of secondary cells that induce remodeling in preparation for metastasis. Growing evidence in the literature suggests that the presence of a primary tumor can prime the insoluble/stromal lung microenvironment in order to create a more hospitable premetastatic niche for metastasis before tumor cells even arrive in the secondary organ. Elegant work by Lyden and colleagues first introduced the premetastatic niche concept in experimental models of melanoma and lung cancer, with further support from studies in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. This work has demonstrated that prior to the recruitment of cancer cells to distant organs, bone marrow-derived CD117+VEGFR1+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) get recruited to the lung and induce ECM remodeling. The recruitment of these cells is mediated by the co-expression of the integrin VLA-4, which interacts with the ligand fibronectin. In a malignant state, CD117+ VEGFR1+ HPCs circulate and bind to areas of increased fibronectin deposition, inducing the release of the proteinase MMP9 and resulting in the breakdown of the basement membrane to promote recruitment and colonization of cancer cells. Recent studies have suggested that these premetastatic changes at the secondary organ site may be mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the primary tumor.The importance of the lung metastatic niche in breast cancer and its relationship to clinically relevant prognostic features such as the molecular subtype remain poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that luminal A versus TN primary tumors would differentially induce changes in the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive TN primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. To investigate this, we used preclinical in vivo models in which luminal A (MCF7) or TN (SUM159) primary breast tumors were grown in female nude mice prior to investigation of potential premetastatic changes. Our results indicate that the presence of a SUM159 TN primary tumor results in enhanced production/mobilization of the CD117+ HPC population in the bone marrow and induces supportive premetastatic changes in both the stromal and soluble components of the lung. In contrast, luminal A MCF7 primary tumors were not able to induce these changes. In support of this, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from different triple negative cell lines induced the expression of premetastatic factors in lung fibroblasts, while EVs from luminal a cell lines had no such effect. Taken together, these novel findings suggest for the first time that the TN breast cancer molecular subtype may be an important determinant of premetastatic changes to both the ECM and soluble components of the lung, potentially mediated via breast cancer-derived EVs.2. Results2.1. Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary Tumors Demonstrate an Increased CD117+ Population in the Bone Marrow Previous studies have demonstrated that CD117+ bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) are produced/mobilized in the bone marrow in order to facilitate the induction of ECM remodeling in secondary organs prior to colonization by metastatic tumor cells. To investigate this, bone marrow was isolated from tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice or mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 mammary fat pad tumors grown to a mean tumor size of up to 1500 mm3 (Supplementary Figure S1), and the CD117+ BMDC population was analyzed using flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure S2a\u2013c). We observed that mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors had a significantly higher percentage of CD117+ cells in their bone marrow relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 1). The percentage of CD117+ BMDCs did not correlate with either primary tumor size (Supplementary Figure S2d) or the length of time bearing a primary tumor (Supplementary Figure S2e).2.2. Expression of Premetastatic Niche Markers Is Enhanced in the Lungs of Mice Bearing Triple Negative SUM159 Primary TumorsPrior to cancer cell seeding at the secondary site, the organ must become competent to enable metastatic tumor growth. The ECM and soluble components of the lung are crucial for mediating this switch to a competent state. To investigate differences in premetastatic niche markers, lungs were harvested at the endpoint from mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors and compared to lungs from corresponding tumor-na\u00efve, age-matched control mice using histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological analysis demonstrated that mice bearing either SUM159 or MCF7 primary tumors had not yet developed lung metastasis at the time of the endpoint/analysis (Figure 2a\u2013c). The absence of metasasis was also confirmed via immunohistochemical staining of additional lung sections with a human-specific mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase antibody (Figure 2d\u2013g) and by qPCR analysis of DNA isolated from the lungs of mice using primers specific to the human ALU sequence (Figure 2h). Immunohistochemical analysis of premetastatic niche markers indicated that, relative to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve controls, mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrated enhanced expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and MMP9 in the lung (Figure 3). To quantify these observations, RNA was isolated from the lungs of tumor-bearing or tumor-na\u00efve mice and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Consistent with the IHC results, we observed that lungs from mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors showed increased expression of murine fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin, MMP9 and collagen A1 compared to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice (p \u2264 0.05) (Figure 4a\u2013e). The expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX) and CCL2 was also examined. Expression of LOX has been shown to be increased in the premetastatic organ microenvironment, inducing collagen crosslinking and promoting the recruitment of BMDCs for ECM remodeling. Coupled with collagen crosslinking, CCL2 acts as a strong attractant for BMDCs cells. We observed a significant increase in LOX and CCL2 expression in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 breast tumors relative to lungs from mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice (Figure 4f,g). Taken together, these results indicate that the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 primary tumor induces the development of premetastatic niche characteristics in the lung by enhancing the expression of ECM proteins and effector molecules that aid in the recruitment of BMDCs. 2.3. The Presence of a Triple-Negative SUM159 Breast Tumor Modifies the Soluble Lung Microenvironment to Enhance Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration The results presented above suggest that the presence of a triple negative SUM159 primary breast tumor can induce premetastatic changes in the lung ECM relative to the presence of a luminal A MCF7 primary tumor or no tumor. We have previously observed that soluble factors derived from the normal physiological lung in tumor-na\u00efve mice can promote TN breast cancer proliferation and migration. We were therefore also interested in evaluating whether the presence of a TN primary tumor would further enhance the ability of the soluble lung microenvironment to support metastatic behavior. Lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 or MCF7 breast tumors and compared to LCM generated from the lungs of age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice. Breast cancer cells were exposed to LCM using a matched or cross-over design and assessed for changes in breast cancer cell migration and proliferation. Relative to LCM from age-matched tumor-na\u00efve mice, we observed that LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors promoted the migration (Figure 5a,b) and proliferation (Figure 5c,d), not only of matched SUM159 cells, but also of luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cells in cross-over experiments (p < 0.05). In contrast, exposure to LCM generated from the lungs of MCF7 tumor-bearing mice did not result in any significant differences in proliferation or migration in either cell line compared to LCM from control mice. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, LCM from both tumor-bearing and tumor-na\u00efve mice was subjected to protein array analysis to interrogate changes in the presence of chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and soluble ECM factors between experimental groups (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we observed that the complement of soluble proteins produced by the lungs of mice bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors was identical to that of lungs from tumor-na\u00efve mice, with 100 proteins reproducibly identified across 3 replicate experiments (Figure 5e). In contrast, 16 different proteins were identified to be consistently present and unique in LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 6 proteins have previously been demonstrated to mediate lung metastasis (Table 1), including CCL7, FGFR4, GM-CSF, MMP3, thrombospondin-1 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest for the first time that, in addition to helping to establish a premetastatic niche through modification of the lung ECM, the presence of a triple-negative SUM159 tumor also induces changes in the soluble lung microenvironment that are supportive of breast cancer metastatic behavior.2.4. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells Induce the Expression of the Premetasatic ECM Markers Periostin and Fibronectin in Lung Fibroblasts Finally, we wanted to begin to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which these premetastatic changes in the lung may be occurring and to expand our investigations to additional TN and luminal A models. To do this, we focused on the possible role of breast cancer-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although EVs were originally considered waste removal mechanisms of cells, a strong body of evidence has now demonstrated that EVs contain functional cargos of proteins, nucleic acids and lipids that facilitate cell\u2013cell communication. Tumor-derived EVs have been shown to be important mediators of metastasis with the ability to target specific organs and to be taken up by recipient cells in order to induce stromal remodeling, alter soluble factor secretion profiles and stimulate angiogenesis. However, the role of EVs in inducing premetastatic changes in the lung in the context of the breast cancer molecular subtype has yet to be investigated.To begin to assess this, we isolated EVs from multiple different human breast cancer cell lines including non-tumorigenic control cells (MCF10A), two luminal A cell lines (MCF7, T47D) and three TN cell lines (SUM159, MDA-MB-231 and LRCP17 (a cell line derived from a TN patient-derived xenograft model)). As additional controls, we also included lung-seeking 231-LM cells, which we expect to show similar expression patterns to the other TN cell lines, and bone-seeking 231-BoM cells, which we expect to show a similar expression pattern to luminal A cells based on their similar preference for bone versus lung. Isolated EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Supplementary Figure S4a) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which confirmed that the isolated EV population was between 38\u2013483 nm (Supplementary Figure S4b). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of specific EV proteins (CD63, TSG101, CD9) (Supplementary Figure S4c). Validated EVs were then labeled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and incubated with primary normal human lung fibroblasts to evaluate the influence of different breast cancer-derived EVs on the expression of premetasatic niche markers (Supplementary Figure S4d). In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that EVs from the TN cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM159 and LRCP17 induced the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin in lung fibroblasts at both the RNA (Figure 6a,b) and protein (Figure 6c,d) levels (p < 0.05). In contrast, EVs from luminal A (MC7 and T47D) cell lines had no significant effect on the expression of periostin and fibronectin. Using multiple cell lines, these results suggest a potential mechanism for the observed differential lung ECM changes seen in our in vivo experiments. 3. DiscussionThe majority of breast cancer deaths are attributed to metastasis-related complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that breast cancer preferentially metastasizes to the brain, bone, liver, lung and lymph nodes, with variable organ tropism across molecular subtypes. However, it remains unclear how and why this observed organ tropism occurs. Of these sites, lung metastasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with no effective way of predicting lung tropism or detecting it early. Interestingly, the lung is the first major capillary bed that a breast cancer cell encounters after escaping from the primary breast tumor into the vasculature and being subjected to normal physiological blood flow patterns. As these cancer cells transverse through the capillaries, they come into contact with up to 100 m2 of surface vasculature. Coupled with the fact the cancer cells are approximately five times the diameter of the pulmonary capillaries, the probability of breast cancer cells arresting and extravasating into lung tissue is exceedingly high. Previous work by Luzzi et al. demonstrated that the process of metastasis up to and including the extravasation step is quite efficient. Despite this, once cancer cells are physically delivered to the secondary organ, only ~0.01% of these cells are able to successfully initiate and sustain growth in the secondary site in order to generate clinically relevant macrometastases. This highlights the critical need for the microenvironment at the secondary site to be suitable for initiating and sustaining cancer growth. However, the details of how and when the lung environment becomes favorable for metastatic growth has yet to be elucidated in the context of breast cancer molecular subtype. Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of a primary tumor has the potential to prime the lung in order to produce a supportive environment for secondary cancer cell seeding and growth, known as the premetastatic niche. The current study suggests for the first time that breast cancer molecular subtype of the primary tumor (TN versus luminal A) may be an important potential determinant of premetastatic niche formation in the lung through modification of both ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment.We observed that, compared to mice bearing luminal A MCF7 tumors or age-matched controls, premetastatic ECM characteristics including expression of fibronectin, tenascin-c, periostin and collagen A1 were enhanced in the lungs of mice bearing triple-negative SUM159 tumors. These proteins form a complex network that coordinates ECM-modulated signal transduction and adhesion at the secondary site. Fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in the lung with the potential to confer resistance to therapy. The expression of fibronectin regulates the expression of several crucial pro-metastatic proteins, such as MMP9. MMP9 expression has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion in the lung and recruitment of BMDCs to further induce pro-metastatic ECM remodeling. Beyond modulating expression, ECM proteins are crucial in maintaining the complex architecture of the matrix. The matricellular protein periostin has been shown to promote the incorporation of tenascin-c into the ECM. Periostin acts as a bridge using adjacent domains to interact with tenascin-c and other ECM proteins such as fibronectin and collagen. This relationship between periostin and tenascin-c is linked to their association with lung metastasis and promotion of cancer cell migration, proliferation and invasion. We also observed that expression of collagen A1 was increased in the lungs of mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors relative to those bearing luminal A MCF7 primary tumors or tumor-na\u00efve mice. Interestingly, this was accompanied by increased LOX and CCL2 expression. LOX mediates the crosslinking of collagen, and in addition to the expression of CCL2, recruits BMDCs to the lung to generate a pro-metastatic environment.Beyond recruiting metastatic cancer cells, fibronectin has been demonstrated to act as a strong attractant for bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), specifically those expressing CD117, VEGFR1 and VLA-4. Previous studies have shown that CD117+ BMDCs are recruited to the lung (specifically to regions of increased fibronectin) prior to the arrival of metastatic cancer cells. In the current study, mice bearing TN SUM159 primary tumors showed a significant increase in the CD117+ population in the bone marrow relative to age-matched controls or MCF7 tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that the TN molecular subtype may influence this subset of the bone marrow population and mobilize it in preparation for metastasis. In addition to determining how the presence of a TN primary breast tumor influences the lung ECM, we also investigated the effect on the soluble lung microenvironment. The lung produces soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and soluble ECM proteins) which are crucial for mediating pulmonary metastasis. Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that the normal physiological lung in tumor na\u00efve mice produces various soluble factors that promote metastatic behavior; however, the ability of the primary tumor to further enhance the soluble lung microenvironment in preparation for metastasis has not been investigated. To assess this, lung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated from mice bearing TN/luminal primary tumors and tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Exposure of SUM159 or MCF7 breast cancer cells to LCM from SUM159 tumor-bearing mice resulted in increased breast cancer proliferation and migration compared to LCM from MCF7 tumor-bearing mice or tumor-na\u00efve mice. This indicates that the composition of the soluble lung microenvironment has been altered in a primary tumor-dependent manner. To begin to elucidate the molecular basis for these observations, a protein array was used and identified the presence of 16 unique factors in the LCM of mice bearing TN tumors, including 6 that have been associated with lung metastasis, inflammation, immunosuppression and angiogenesis (CCL7, FGFR4, MMP3, thrombospondin-1, VEGF and GM-CSF). A limitation of this protein array is its ability to only interrogate 308 soluble factors, a small fraction of the lung secretome. Future studies are needed to expand on these results using more sensitive and unbiased methods such as mass spectrometry, which may enable the identification of how the soluble component changes in a tumor-bearing state and further differentiate differences in a molecular subtype-specific manner.Taken together, the in vivo changes to the stromal and soluble components of the lung suggest that there may be unique communication between the primary tumor and the lung that is different between the TN SUM159 breast cancer model and the luminal A MCF7 model. To begin to investigate this, we focused our attention on extracellular vesicles (EVs) since previous studies have identified EVs as mediators of organ tropism and premetastatic niche formation in the lung. To evaluate this, the expression of the premetastatic niche markers periostin and fibronectin was evaluated in normal human lung fibroblasts following treatment with EVs from several different TN and luminal A breast cancer cell lines. In support of our in vivo findings, we observed that treatment of lung fibroblasts by TN EVs significantly increased periostin and fibronectin expression relative to EVs from luminal A or control breast cancer cells. These results suggest the intriguing possibility that EVs produced by TN breast cancer cells may preferentially signal the lung microenvironment in preparation for successful metastasis. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the molecular differences in EV cargo (i.e., DNA, RNA and protein content) and the subsequent functional and mechanistic implications for breast cancer metastasis in the lung. Given the clinical disparity between sites of metastasis and overall survival between luminal A and TN subtypes of breast cancer, the ability to identify unique EV profiles may be useful for both understanding breast cancer biology and developing new clinical biomarkers for lung metastasis in the future. In summary, the novel findings presented in this study demonstrate that the presence of triple-negative SUM159 versus luminal A MCF7 primary breast tumors induces differential changes in both the ECM and soluble lung microenvironment, with more aggressive triple-negative SUM159 primary tumors demonstrating enhanced establishment of a supportive lung niche that promotes metastatic behavior. These findings support the concept that the molecular subtype of the primary tumor may influence the ability of the lung to be \u201cprimed\u201d in preparation for metastasis. The luminal A and TN molecular subtypes were chosen for initial investigation because they are on the opposite ends of the spectrum of aggressiveness and display a separation clinically with regards to the propensity for developing lung metastasis. While the molecular subtype is likely not the only factor that influences premetastatic changes to the stromal and soluble lung microenvironment in breast cancer, the differential results between TN and luminal A models seen in this study set the stage for future studies aimed at elucidating this concept further through investigation of other clinically used molecular subtypes (HER2+ and luminal B), as well as subsets of the triple-negative subtype. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture The SUM-159 human triple negative cell line was obtained from Asterand Inc. (Detroit, MI, USA) and was cultured in HAMS:F12 + 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone 1% HEPES. The MCF7 luminal A human breast cancer cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA) and was cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, USA) + 10% FBS. Cell lines were authenticated via third party testing (IDEXX BioAnalytics, Columbia, MO, USA) between October 2018 and October 2019. The MCF10A cell line was obtained from ATCC and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 5% FBS + 100 ng/mL cholera toxin. The MDA-MB-231 cell line was obtained from Dr. Ann Chambers (London Health Science Centre, London, Canada) and was cultured in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS. The MDA-MB-231-4175 LM2 (231-LM; lung-seeking metastatic variant) and MDA-MB-231-1833 BoM (231-BoM; bone-seeking metastatic variant) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9 (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA) and were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS. The LRCP17 cell line was generated in-house from a TN patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model after being grown as a mammary fat pad tumor in NOD/SCID mice for 2 passages, enzymatically dissociated and established in culture in DMEM:F12 + 10% FBS + 0.5% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 1% HEPES and 0.1% BSA. The original breast tumor biopsy used to generate the LRCP17 PDX was obtained from a breast cancer patient with metaplastic TN (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer following informed consent under a human ethics protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario HSREB (#103613). Primary normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) were obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland) and were cultured in FGM-2 fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) that included supplementation with 0.5% insulin, 0.1% human basic fibroblast growth factor (hbFGF), 0.1% gentamicin/ amphotericin (GA-1000) and 2% FBS. 4.2. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the Canadian Council of Animal Care under a protocol approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee (#2017-136). MCF7 and SUM159 human breast cancer cells were suspended in Hanks\u2019 Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Sigma, Kawasaki, Japan) at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (100 \u03bcL; 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were injected into the mammary fad pad (m.f.p.) of 6\u20138-week old female nude mice (Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu; Envigo, Mississauga, ON, Canada) (n = 54 mice/group) as described previously. Mice injected with MCF7 cells or their matched tumor-na\u00efve controls were implanted with subcutaneous time-release estrogen pellets (0.10 mg/pellet) with 90-day release (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, USA) for the duration of the experiments. Primary tumor size was longitudinally assessed using weekly digital caliper measurements in 2 perpendicular dimensions and was calculated using the formula: volume = 0.52 \u00d7 (width)2 \u00d7 (length). Primary tumors were allowed to grow up to 1500 mm3, with mice in tumor-bearing groups (SUM159/MCF7) sacrificed at the same time as age-matched, tumor-na\u00efve control mice. Within each group, mice were randomly assigned to 4 subgroups for different tissue uses: for n = 15 mice, lungs were flash frozen for DNA/RNA isolation; for n = 15 mice, lungs were collected for conditioned media isolation and for n = 9 mice, lungs were formalin fixed for histopathology. Additional tissues (primary tumors, lymph nodes, liver, bone, brain) were formalin-fixed for histology, and bone marrow was collected and used for flow cytometry analysis (n = 15). 4.3. Flow Cytometry AnalysisAt the endpoint, bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia of mice, and a cell suspension of bone marrow (BM) was obtained. Red blood cells were lysed with NH4Cl for 10 min prior to incubation with 20 \u03bcL of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD117 antibody (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and 10 \u03bcL of fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 antibody (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 \u03bcL of flow buffer (5% FBS + 0.5% EDTA). All samples were stored on ice in the dark and analyzed on a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA).4.4. Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Lungs isolated from mice were formalin-fixed (10%), paraffin-embedded and sectioned (4 \u00b5m) prior to staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or for use in immunohistochemical analysis. For IHC, samples were deparaffinized with xylene and were successively washed with a gradient of ethanol washes (100\u201370%). Antigen retrieval was subsequently performed, samples were incubated in a 100 \u00b0C water bath immersed in citrate buffer (50 mM of citric acid, pH 6.0) for 20 min and cooled at room temperature. Slides were stained using an IHC kit (Cat#: ab64264, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) using antibodies detailed in Supplementary Table S3, diluted in 5% BSA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. Samples were analyzed by a trained veterinary pathologist (P.K.) using four random sections/organ/mouse and 10 high-powered fields of view (HP-FOVs)/sections at 400\u00d7 magnification (n = 9 mice/group).4.5. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)Quantitative qPCR for the human ALU sequence was carried out as previously described. Briefly, lungs were homogenized, and DNA was isolated using a DNA purification kit (Cat#: 69504, Qiagen; Hilden, Germany). Relative quantification of the presence of the human ALU sequence was performed using SYBR Green Mastermix (Invitrogen) and the human ALU primers 5\u2032-GTCAGGAGATCGAGACCATCCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGTGGCGCAATCTCGGC-3\u2032 (reverse) as previously described.For qRT-PCR analysis of homogenized lung tissue from in vivo experiments or normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs), TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used to isolate total RNA followed by purification using an RNA purification kit (Cat#: 12183555, Invitrogen). Total RNA (1 \u03bcg) was reverse-transcribed using Superscript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen) and the Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Relative quantification of RNA expression of murine periostin, tenascin-c, fibronectin, MMP9, collagen A1, LOX, CCL2 (lung tissue) or human periostin and fibronectin (NHLFs) was determined by quantitative PCR using Taqman Fast Advanced Mastermix (Invitrogen) and Taqman primers detailed in Supplementary Table S4. Relative RNA expression was determined using the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT method as previously described, with GAPDH used for normalization. 4.6. Generation of Lung-Conditioned MediaLung-conditioned media (LCM) were generated as described previously. Briefly, at the time of sacrifice, lungs were aseptically removed, washed and kept in cold sterile PBS on ice. Lungs were weight normalized by resuspension at a 4:1 media to tissue (vol/wt) ratio in DMEM:F12 + 1\u00d7 MITO+ (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) + penicillin (50 U/mL)/streptomycin (50 \u03bcg/mL) (pen/strep; Invitrogen). Lungs were cultured for 24 h; LCM were collected, filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm filters to remove cellular debris and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To account for mouse-to-mouse variability, LCM from multiple mice were pooled before use in functional experiments.4.7. Breast Cancer Cell Migration and Proliferation AssaysDifferences in migration between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed using transwell migration assays. Transwell inserts (8 \u00b5m pore size) were coated with gelatin and exposed to media in the bottom well, including LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal media (DMEM:F12 + 1X MITO+). Breast cancer cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were seeded onto the top portion of each transwell chamber and incubated for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 prior to staining and assessment of differences in migration. Differences in proliferation between MCF7 and SUM159 cells in response to LCM were assessed by BrdU incorporation. Breast cancer cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were plated in chamber slides and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 with basal media + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with basal media, and cells were incubated for 5 days at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. The basal medium was then replaced with LCM from tumor-bearing mice (MCF7 or SUM159), LCM from corresponding age-matched control mice or basal medium for 24 h. Cells were formalin-fixed and incubated with mouse anti-human BrdU primary antibody (Invitrogen) for 12 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Invitrogen) secondary antibody and DAPI. Five HP-FOVs were analyzed for each well, and a mean number of migrated or proliferating cells/FOV was calculated using ImageJ software (NIH, version 1.51(100), Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.8. Protein Array AnalysisTo assess similarities and differences in soluble factors present under different LCM conditions, RayBio AAM-BLM-1 label-based mouse antibody arrays were used to simultaneously assess the expression of 308 soluble murine target proteins (RayBiotech Inc, Norcross, GA, USA). Post-dialysis protein concentration of LCM (n = 3 per condition) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada), labeled and incubated with protein arrays as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Results were visualized using chemiluminescence and film exposure (CL-XPosure Film; Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Results (n = 3 per media condition) were analyzed using the RayBiotech analysis tool for AAM-BLM-1. Sixteen confirmed protein hits unique to LCM generated from the lungs of mice bearing SUM159 tumors were identified as having values > 1 after background subtraction and validation across three replicates. Due to differences in antibody affinities for target antigens, quantitative comparison between different proteins was not feasible using this platform. 4.9. Isolation and Characterization of Breast Cancer-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)4.9.1. EV Isolation Human breast cancer cells (MCF10A, T47D, MCF7, SUM159, MDA-MB-231, 231-LM, 231-BoM and LRCP17) were grown to approximately 80% confluency in normal growth media. Culture media were replaced with serum-free media, and cells were incubated under hypoxic culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 1% CO2) for 48 h to enhance EV production and packaging. Culture media were harvested, and EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, cells and debris were cleared from the harvested culture media by centrifugation (30 min 1000\u00d7 g), followed by filtration using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters (Millipore; Billerica, MA) and removal of larger vesicles using an additional centrifugation step (1 h 13,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C). Cell-free media were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (100 kDa; Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000\u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C. EVs were subsequently purified by overlaying concentrated samples on qEV size-exclusion chromatography columns (Izon Science Ltd.; Christchurch, New Zealand) followed by elution with PBS. Finally, the eluates from the qEV columns were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 10 kDa nominal molecular weight centrifugal filter units (Millipore) to a final volume of approximately 200 \u00b5L. Following EV characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting (described below), concentrated EVs were labelled with the green fluorescent membrane dye PKH67 and used to treat normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLFs) prior to analysis by immunoblotting (50 \u00b5g EVs every 12 h for 48 h per 60 mm plate of NHLFs at 60\u201370% confluency; n = 3 replicates per EV treatment).4.9.2. EV Characterization by TEMAnalysis of EVs by TEM was carried out as previously described. After EV isolation, 5 \u03bcL of the final suspension was absorbed onto freshly prepared carbon-coated 400 mesh nickel TEM grids and negative staining was done using 1% uranyl acetate in 1% aqueous methyl cellulose. Images were collected using a Philips 420 transmission electron microscope equipped with an AMT 4K megapixel XR41S-B camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 4.9.3. EV Characterization by NTAParticle size distribution of isolated EV suspensions was determined by NTA using a NanoSight NS300 system (Malvern Technologies, Malvern, UK) configured with a 488 nm laser and a high-sensitivity scientific CMOS camera as previously described. Isolated EVs were diluted 1:200 with 0.2 \u00b5m filtered PBS. The chamber of the NanoSight NS300 was loaded with diluted EVs using a 1 mL syringe. A syringe pump at speed 40 was used to maintain a steady flow rate of EVs during video acquisition. Three 30 s videos were acquired using camera level 14. NTA software version 3.2.16 (Malvern Panalytical) was used to track particles and analyze data using detection threshold 5.4.9.4. ImmunoblottingFor protein analysis, 1\u00d7 RIPA lysis was added to resuspended EV pellets or EV-treated NHLFs, and the resulting protein was quantified using a Lowry assay as previously described. Protein (50 \u03bcg per sample) was boiled for 10 min in solution with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (150 V for 1 h) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF; Millipore). Membranes were blocked using 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Anti-human primary antibodies were diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA and used for immunoblotting as detailed in Supplementary Table S5. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA, USA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST \u00b1 5% BSA were used at concentrations of 1:1000. Protein expression was visualized using Amersham ECL Prime Detection Reagent (GE Healthcase, Wauwatosa, WI, USA).4.10. Statistical AnalysisIn vitro experiments were performed a minimum of three times with at least three technical replicates included in each experiment. In vivo studies were carried out using multiple mice as detailed in Section 4.2. above. In all cases, quantitative data were compiled from all experiments. Unless otherwise noted, data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests (for comparison between all media conditions or RNA expression). Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in metastatic organ tropism between different breast cancer molecular subtypes are unknown. In this study, we reveal for the first time that TN primary tumors in particular have the ability to induce premetastatic changes in both the ECM and soluble components of the lung microenvironment and in distant sites such as the bone marrow, a process that is potentially mediated by breast cancer-derived EVs. These changes are associated with the capacity to develop a \u201cfertile\u201d premetastatic niche in the lung and to support metastatic behaviors such as migration and proliferation that are needed to recruit breast cancer cells from the primary tumor and assist in lung colonization. Notably, these supportive premetastatic changes were not observed in mice bearing luminal A primary tumors, suggesting the possibility of subtype-dependent alterations in the lung microenvironment. Overall, elucidation of how the cancer-induced components of the metastatic niche evolve in relation to prognostic features such as molecular subtype could facilitate improved clinical management of breast cancer patients, with the goal of earlier detection, treatment and/or prevention of lung metastasis in breast cancer patients.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at : Figure S1: In vivo primary tumor growth of MCF7 and SUM159 breast cancer cells.

IntroductionIn the past solid tumors were regarded as relatively homogeneous groups of hyperproliferating cells with the ability to invade neighboring tissues and, possibly, metastasize. More recently, a large body of evidence has convincingly revealed that tumors are complex organs composed of multiple cell types and extracellular matrix (ECM). Intensive studies on solid mammary, lung, intestinal and prostatic cancer have described a surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME), that includes infiltrated immune cells (T cells and macrophages), endothelial cells, pericytes, adipocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). During the development of solid tumors, all these components work synergistically, ultimately becoming supportive of cancer progression, dissemination and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Among TME cells, CAFs, also defined as myofibroblasts, are the most abundant cell type and orchestrate paracrine pro-tumorigenic signaling with adjacent tumor cells, thus accelerating tumor progression. Although in physiological conditions, tissue fibroblasts are characterised by negligible transcriptional and metabolic activity, they may be activated during tumorigenesis, and acquire a wide spectrum of new abilities that sustain the establishment of solid tumors. Whether CAF phenotype in TME is reversible, and to what extent, is still debated. CAFs are identified by the overexpression of several activation markers, like \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and fibroblasts activation protein (FAP), associated to the loss of caveolin-1 (CAV-1). Recruitment and activation of peritumoral fibroblasts are mediated by growth factors secreted by cancer epithelial and by several TME cell types, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), platelets-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Recent evidence highlights the relevance of IGF-1 and IGF-2 (Insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2), secreted by mammary tumor epithelial cells and inducing the recruitment and activation of patient-derived primary CAFs through the IGF-1R.Mechanistically, CAFs can contribute to cancer progression via integrin-linked mechanisms, through the generation of pro-migratory tracks favoring cancer cell invasion in the stromal ECM, and through \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-dependent matrix reorganization and fibronectin assembly. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which enable adhesion, proliferation, and migration of cells by recognizing binding motifs in ECM proteins. Notably, a subset of integrin receptors is overexpressed on the surface of tumor and stromal cells, with a high impact on tumor progression. Of particular interest, the \u03b1v integrins, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 integrin, reported to be expressed in several solid tumors. Among the most promising anti-\u03b1v integrins drugs, abituzumab, intetumumab, two pan-\u03b1v integrin antibodies and the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, that specifically inhibits \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25. Despite their pre-clinical efficacy, most of these treatments failed their primary endpoints in phase 2 and phase 3 trials. However, alternative approaches may be considered, including their inhibition in non-neoplastic peritumoral cells, as they still remain valid therapeutic targets.This work is focused on the design, conformational and functional analysis of novel decapeptides endowed with the ability to prevent tumor migration and invasion. Previous work indicates that the serine protease urokinase (uPA) has a catalytically-independent motogen activity that resides in its amino-terminal growth factor domain (GFD, residues 1\u201349) and in its connecting peptide region (CP, residues 132\u2013158). The CP region binds to \u03b1v integrin, bridging uPAR and the \u03b1v\u03b25. Most of the chemotactic activity of CP-derived peptide uPA-(135\u2013158), named CPp, (Table 1) is retained by its C-terminal segment uPA-(144\u2013158). In contrast, the N-terminal, uPA-(135\u2013143) peptide, is inhibitory. Furthermore, following phosphorylation of Ser138/139, full uPA acquires remarkable anti-migratory properties, which are retained by the Glu-substituted forms S138E/S303E. Previous conformational analysis of the CP-derived, anti-migratory peptides, showed the occurrence of a turn structure around the 140\u2013143 segment, which brings its flanking N- and C-terminal regions close to each other. These findings were instrumental and suggested the development of two novel peptides whose sequence corresponds to the N-terminal region of CPp, incorporates the S138E substitution, and allows the E138-K145 side chain to side chain contact, thus stabilizing the putative bioactive conformation. In this study, we show that the two novel decapeptides, based on these characteristics, denoted as Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Table 1) prevented mouse lung metastases. They also inhibited migration and invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells through the \u03b1v-integrin subunit. Furthermore, the novel peptides induced a partial reversion of the CAF phenotype and markedly reduced the pro-invasive ability of peritumoral CAFs from breast cancer patients in combination with MDA-MB-231 mammary adenocarcinoma cells.2. Results2.1. Peptide DesignTo identify new molecules of pharmacological interest, one possibility is to reprogram and shorten sub-domains of relevant proteins with modular molecular structure. In the present study, two novel decapeptides derived from the CP region of human uPA, namely Pep 1 and Pep 2 (also denoted as uPAcyclin) are presented (Table 1).Conformational analysis of previously published anti-migratory peptides, corresponding to the N-terminal region of CP, denoted [138E]uPA-(135\u2013158), and uPA-(135\u2013143), demonstrated the existence of a \u03b2-turned structure, encompassing residues 140\u2013143 (Figure 1). This secondary structure was not detected in the uPA-(135\u2013158) or CPp peptide, endowed with a clear-cut pro-migratory activity. These findings suggested that the folding induced by the \u03b2-turn could shorten the distance between the N- and C-terminal flanking regions. In the linear Pep 1, two further C-terminal residues were included in the [138E]uPA-(135\u2013143) and the N-terminal Lys135 was omitted. In the resulting Pep 1, NMR analysis confirmed the proximity of the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 residues (Figure 1). This observation prompted us to design Pep 2, in which the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 were covalently linked by an amide bond.2.2. Conformational AnalysisConformational analysis of Pep 1 and Pep 2 was carried out by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in water solution. Pep 1 showed a \u03b2-turn around the Pro142-Glu143, as evinced by a diagnostic NOE between H\u03b1 of residue Pro142 and HN of Glu144, with flanking regions in extended conformation. Structure calculation based on NMR derived constraints disclosed a type I \u03b2-turn flanked by two \u03b2-strand structures. Many conformers (about 60%) also displayed a salt bridge between Glu138 and Lys145 side chains (Figure 1). In Pep 2 NMR spectra, most features resemble those of Pep 1. However, about half of the peptide molecules exhibited the Ser139-Pro140 amide bond in cis configuration. Unfortunately, most signals arising from the trans and cis sub-populations are overlapping, thus preventing us from obtaining the necessary NOEs for structure calculation.2.3. Inhibition of Malignant Cell Lung Colonization In Vivo by Pep 2Since intra-molecular cyclisation may increase peptide stability and permeability, the anti-tumoral properties of Pep 2 were first tested in vivo. To this end, HT1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line metastasising to the lungs in nude mice, were exposed to 1 \u00b5M Pep 2 for 1 h and injected into the tail vein of 15 mice. Of these, 5 mice received Pep 2 at 0.068 mg/day (3.4 mg/kg/day) every day, and 5 mice received 0.3 mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) for 10 days every day and then once a week, whereas 5 control mice received injections of vehicle only.After 28 days, mice were sacrificed, lungs were surgically removed and compared with lungs from five healthy mice. Figure 2A shows the macroscopic view of whole lungs from healthy, untreated and peptide-treated animals. Morphometric analysis of lung metastatic foci revealed a mean neoplastic area significantly lower in Pep 2-treated compared to untreated mice (Figure 2A). Accordingly, histological analysis showed that intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci in untreated mice dramatically decrease when mice were treated with Pep 2, in both the treatment schedules (Figure 2B).To obtain a quantitative measure of the treatment efficiency, one lung of each animal was subjected to a total genomic DNA extraction to quantify the amount of Alu sequences in murine lung samples amplified. The PCR amplification products were separated on agarose gel (Figure 2C). The number of human cells in murine lung samples was calculated by comparing the obtained PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing decreasing numbers of HT1080 human cells with increasing numbers of mouse P19 embryonic cells, and keeping 107 as total cell number. DNA from healthy murine lung sample was included as a control (H). In Figure 2D, the ImageJ analysis reveals that the amplification signal of Alu sequences from lungs of mice treated with 15 mg/kg peptide discontinuously or with 3.4 mg/kg every day, was three to four-fold lower, respectively, compared to lungs of untreated mice. Animals were daily monitored and neither severe signs of toxicity nor dysfunction of normal organs or weight loss higher than 10% were observed after Pep 2 peptide treatment. These data show that Pep 2 has a clear-cut anti-metastatic activity, preventing malignant cell lung colonization at micromolar concentrations. Remarkably, the 3.4 mg/kg every day lower dosage is equally effective than the discontinuous treatment at 15 mg/kg.2.4. Inhibition of Fibrosarcoma Invasion in 3D-Organotypic Assay by Pep 1 or Pep 2 DecapeptidesAmong the peritumoral cell types, myofibroblasts are the most abundant, and active to remodel ECM, induce angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, and resistance to cell death. The 3D organotypic invasion assays with matrix-embedded fibroblasts recapitulate TME and may provide information about the cells responding to peptide inhibition. To this end, telomerase immortalised fibroblasts or TIF, with a marked ability to contract matrices and expressing \u03b1-SMA, were co-cultured with HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells to monitor invasion of the underlying matrix in the presence or in the absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2. During the initial three days, in the \u201cmatrix contraction\u201d phase, collagen-embedded TIF fibroblasts undergo further matrix deposition to generate a stiff collagen disk. Afterwards, peptides were accurately removed and GFP-expressing HT1080 cells, were seeded on top of matrices and left to grow for two days and then to invade either for 3 or for 6 days (Figure 3A). Pep 1 or Pep 2 were either included only in the contraction phase (contraction), thus exposing only TIF fibroblasts, and then removed, or applied throughout the experiment (invasion).As summarized in the legend to Figure 3A, after 3 or 6 days of invasion, matrices fixed, sectioned, and stained with DAPI and representative images were captured with a fluorescence microscope (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, Pep 2, included during the invasion phase, reduced HT1080-GFP invasion by 80% after 3 days of invasion and by over 40%, after 6 days. The number of invading cells was quantified by ImageJ software and unexposed cells were taken as 100% (Figure 3C). If TIFs were exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2 only during the matrix contraction phase, and subsequently removed during the invasion phase, tumor invasion was impaired by 50\u201360% at 3 and 6 h (Pep 1 and Pep 2 contraction, Figure 3C). The latter findings suggest that Pep 2-exposed TIF matrices are not fully permissive to HT1080 invasion. It has to be noticed that TIFs pre-exposure to Pep2 leads to a 40% decrease of HT1080 invasion, whereas Pep2-treatment of both, HT1080 and TIFs, leads to an 80% inhibition, after 3 days. In separate experiments, we have determined that TIFs express about 40% of the \u03b1v integrin protein levels expressed by HT1080 cells (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). The data overall confirm a direct effect of Pep 2 on HT1080 invasion and suggest a partial contribution by TIFs to the inhibition of tumor cell invasion.Whether also mouse CAFs are Pep 2-sensitive remains to be determined. To investigate whether the impaired invasion is due to reduced secretion of motogen factors by peptide-treated fibroblasts, serum-free CM from Pep 1 or Pep 2-exposed TIF fibroblasts was tested as chemoattractant for HT1080-GFP cells. Figure 3D shows a significant mobilization effect of HT1080-GFP by CM from untreated TIF in directional migration assays in Boyden chambers. In contrast, CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lacked the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, actually exhibiting a weak inhibitory effect of fibrosarcoma cell basal migration. To investigate the indirect mechanisms modulating tumor invasion, TIFs were exposed to metallo-protease (MMP) inhibitors. GM6001-treated fibroblasts exhibit reduced matrix contraction and pro-invasive abilities, suggesting that MMPs are relevant to these fibroblast properties (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the novel peptides interfere with the secretion of motogen factors and/or with MMP synthesis/secretion remains to be determined.2.5. Inhibition of HT1080 Cell Invasion by \u03b1v Integrin Receptor Interaction with Pep 1 or Pep 2To further dissect HT1080 and TIF cell responses to Pep 1 and Pep 2, their ability to prevent directional cell migration and invasion was tested. Unlike the scrambled peptide (Table 1), Pep 1, and Pep 2 reduce FBS-dependent migration of HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner, IC50 being around 10\u221210 M (Figure S1A). Also, HT1080 matrix invasion in Boyden chamber assays was strongly inhibited by Pep 1 and Pep 2 (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TIF migration is indeed prevented by Pep 1 or Pep 2, indicating a clear-cut response to both peptides (Figure 4B).We also assessed the effects of Pep 2 on HT1080 migration by a scratch would healing assay. In untreated controls, the wound appeared closed after 24 h, whereas Pep 2 reduced HT1080 wound closure by 20% after 12 h and by 60\u201370% after 24 h (Figure S1B). As shown in Figure S2A, TIF fibroblasts were monitored for 24 h under the same conditions and quantitative data are reported in Figure S2B. Again, Pep 2 could reduce the speed of wound closure at any time point, the process being slowed by 20\u201370% after 12 and 24 h, respectively. In conclusion, cell exposure to Pep 2 leads to a significant inhibition of HT1080 fibrosarcoma and TIF fibroblasts random migration.To investigate the specific interaction of the novel peptides with the surface of cells employed in this study, binding assays with FITC-Pep 2 peptide were performed. Previously published peptides, derived from the uPA CP region, were characterised by a high affinity binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit. Therefore, human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and the relative \u03b1v- stably overexpressing counterpart HEK-293-\u03b1v, were tested to check for increased binding of FITC-Pep 2, together with TIF fibroblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, used in this study. All cells were pre-incubated with an excess unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 peptides and then exposed to FITC-Pep 2. Cell surface-associated fluorescence was measured, the reference 100% being cells unexposed to FITC-Pep 2 (Figure 4C). Unlike the scrambled peptide, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associated with the surface of all cells examined. In particular, HEK-293-\u03b1v exhibited a 3\u20134-fold increased binding, as compared to parental HEK-293 cells indicating that Pep 2 binding increases in cells overexpressing \u03b1v integrin. Although to a different extent, FITC-Pep 2 specifically associates to HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and TIF fibroblasts. To further confirm the \u03b1v integrin receptor as a molecular target of Pep 2, the expression of \u03b1v subunit was silenced in HT1080 cells, subsequently tested for the extent of FITC-Pep 2 binding. A 70% silencing efficiency, compared to cells bearing control siRNA, was revealed by Western Blot analysis and relative quantification (Figure 4D, inset). As shown in Figure 4D, HT1080 transfected with si-CTRL specifically bound to FITC-Pep 2, unless pre-incubated with 500 nM Pep 2. In contrast, \u03b1v-silenced HT1080 cells fail to specifically bind FITC-Pep 2. Furthermore, cell pre-treatment with monoclonal or polyclonal blocking antibodies to \u03b1v integrin or purified vitronectin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C abolished FITC-Pep 2 specific binding. Conversely, antibodies against \u03b13 integrin or polyclonal anti-actin or monoclonal anti-GAPDH were ineffective, confirming the specificity of Pep 2 binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit.2.6. Partial Reversion of CAF-Like Phenotype in TIF Fibroblasts Exposed to Pep 1 or Pep 2As shown by the organotypic assays, the two \u03b1v integrin binding novel peptides, may counteract the pro-invasive ability of TIF fibroblasts through the inhibition of fibroblast-secreted motogen factors (Figure 3). In light of the crucial role of ECM in regulating neoplastic progression and providing biochemical cues and mechanical scaffolding to cell invasion, the possibility that peptide-exposure of TIFs leads to an altered non-permissive, matrix deposition, was examined.To monitor the deposition of the collagen matrix by fibroblasts, TIFs, pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2, were included in a collagen I neutralized solution, and the area of resultant matrices measured after 2 and 3 days (Figure 5A). Relative to the area of the matrix reorganized by untreated TIFs at Day 2 (100% control), cells pre-exposure to Pep 1 led to a slight, but significant, increase in matrix area, whereas Pep 2 led to 30\u201350% larger matrices, after 2 and 3 days, respectively. To test whether collagen I fibers density was affected by the peptides, matrices were subjected to Picrosirius red staining (Figure 5B). This procedure revealed a 50\u201370% decrease in fibers density after treatment with Pep 1 and Pep 2, respectively, suggesting the impairment of matrix contraction and collagen deposition by fibroblasts exposed to 100 nM peptides. However, this possibility requires a validation with other ECM remodeling signatures.These findings support the possibility that peptide-treated TIF fibroblasts become non-permissive to tumor cell invasion not only because of decreased motogen factors secretion, but also because of impaired matrix deposition. Evidence from the literature shows that primary fibroblasts switch to a myofibroblast-like phenotype, under common culture conditions, even in the absence of FBS. Increased ECM deposition, soluble factors secretion and migratory behavior characterize fibroblasts with a CAF-like phenotype. Among the characteristics of fibroblast activation, are an increased \u03b1-SMA and decreased CAV-1 protein levels. Thus, we evaluated the expression level of two relevant CAF markers in peptide-exposed and unexposed TIFs. As shown in Figure 5C, TIFs express a basal level of \u03b1-SMA, indicating a partial CAF-like phenotype. After 48 h preincubation with either peptide, Pep 1 or Pep 2 downregulated \u03b1-SMA protein levels by 30% and 80%, respectively. In contrast, CAV-1 protein levels reached 120% in Pep 1-treated fibroblasts and nearly 200% in Pep 2-treated fibroblasts, suggesting that both peptides induce a partial deactivation of TIFs.The decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels was assessed also by immunofluorescence with polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody after 72 h of treatment with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 (Figure 5D). In treated cells, not only the number of \u03b1-SMA-positive cells decreases, but also a general decrease in intra-cellular fluorescence signal was observed, compared to control cells. Histograms in Figure 5D show a 70% and an 80% decrease in \u03b1-SMA fluorescence signal in Pep 1-treated and Pep 2-treated TIF, respectively, compared to untreated TIF taken as 100%.In conclusion, the reduced ability to secrete motogen factors, to efficiently contract collagen matrices, together with the increased CAV-1 and decreased \u03b1-SMA expression markers, indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs, resulting in an overall impairment of fibrosarcoma cells invasion in 3D-organotypic co-cultures.2.7. Proliferation and Apoptosis of TIF and HT1080-GFP Cells Unaffected by Pep 2The effects of Pep 2 on cell proliferation and apoptosis of HT1080-GFP and TIF cells were assessed. As shown in Figure S3A,C, both cell lines did not proliferate in culture, in the absence of FBS. In particular, the growth curves of HT1080-GFP, in the presence or absence of Pep 2, are perfectly superimposable, showing no changes of proliferation rate (Figure S3A). Pep 2-treated TIF cells showed a slight but not significant decrease in the proliferation rate after 24 and 48 h (Figure S3C). The possibility that Pep 2 may be pro-apototic was investigated by a caspase 3/7 apoptosis luminometric assay (Figure S3B,D) on TIF and HT1080-GFP cells exposed for 24 and 48 h to Pep 2. In both cases, serum-deprived cells were taken as 100% and apoptosis in samples with FBS was calculated relative to that. FBS strongly reduced the extent of apoptosis and the inclusion of Pep 2 did not further enhance the effects of serum.2.8. Inhibition of CAF-Like Phenotype and Pro-Invasive Activity of \u03b1v-Silenced TIF FibroblastsAs shown in Figure 4, \u03b1v integrin subunit is the cellular target of Pep 2, and therefore its silencing should result in outcomes similar to those observed in peptide-treated fibroblasts. To evaluate whether \u03b1v-depleted TIFs, had similar characteristics to those of Pep 1- or Pep 2-exposed fibroblasts, \u03b1v silenced-TIF cells were embedded in collagen matrices and subjected to 3D-organotypic assays with HT1080-GFP cells. As shown in Figure 6A, the invasion of fibrosarcoma cells was dramatically impaired in matrices remodeled by TIF fibroblasts silenced for \u03b1v integrin expression. Figure 6B shows that the number of invading cells, into matrices with \u03b1v-silenced fibroblasts, was reduced to baseline levels after 6 days of invasion, compared to TIF bearing the si-CTRL. In separate experiments we have determined that \u03b1v silencing affects TIFs proliferation (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). If the reduced HT1080 cell invasion is due to the lower number of si-\u03b1v TIFs in the matrices or to a reduced \u03b1v-dependent pro-invasive ability remains to be determined.To verify the presence of secreted motogen factors following RNA silencing in TIF fibroblasts, as previously observed for peptide-treated fibroblasts, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs were employed as chemoattractants for HT1080-GFP in directional migration assays. Figure 6C shows an approximately 2.5-fold increase in HT1080-GFP chemoattraction by CM from TIFs carrying si-CTRL. In contrast, CM from \u03b1v-silenced TIFs lost the ability to chemoattract HT1080-GFP cells, showing a phenotype similar to that observed in Figure 3D. Collagen reorganisation by \u03b1v-silenced TIFs was then tested by a collagen I matrix contraction assay, 24 h after transfection with si-CTRL or \u03b1v integrin siRNA. TIFs were processed as in Figure 5A, and time-dependent decrease of matrix area, was monitored. Figure 6D shows that \u03b1v-silenced TIFs generated matrices with 30% and 10% larger areas 2 and 3 days after siRNA transfection, respectively, as compared to fibroblasts carrying si-CTRL. Overall, these findings show that either treatment with both decapeptides or \u03b1v-silencing reduce the secretion of motogen factors and impair the matrix contractile ability of TIF fibroblasts.Then, the efficiency of \u03b1v integrin RNA silencing and the concomitant levels of \u03b1-SMA were evaluated by western blot. As shown in Figure 6E, the 50% reduction in \u03b1v protein levels after 48 h of silencing, and the 70% after 72 h was accompanied by a reduction in the expression levels of \u03b1-SMA protein by 60% after 48 or 72 h.In addition, \u03b1-SMA levels were assayed in \u03b1v-lacking TIF fibroblasts by immunofluorescence assays and quantified by ImageJ software (Figure 6F). In accordance with the results shown in Figure 6E, \u03b1v-silencing causes a 50% decrease in \u03b1-SMA protein levels in peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts, confirming that treatment with peptides and \u03b1v-silencing produce similar intracellular effects. Overall, these data further support the peptide-\u03b1v interaction and highlight a relevant role for \u03b1v integrin as a mediator of CAF phenotype down-modulation.2.9. Exposure to Pep 2 of Primary CAFs Prevents Their Pro-Invasive Activity in a 3D-AssayMany studies have confirmed the active role of CAFs in breast TME and their effects on the onset, growth and spread of neoplastic cells. Considering that the novel decapeptides can partially revert the CAF-like phenotype of TIFs by interfering with their pro-invasive ability and CAF markers expression, an effort was made to extend these results to primary breast CAFs. Intra-tumoral fibroblasts were previously isolated from biopsies of two breast adenocarcinoma samples, from patients H and M (H-CAFs and M-CAFs, respectively) by De Vincenzo et al.. Firstly, these primary CAFs could contract collagen matrices, similarly to that observed with TIFs (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). This finding opened the possibility to test CAFs susceptibility to Pep 2 in a 3D-organotypic assay with primary breast CAF and the highly aggressive, poorly differentiated MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, to recapitulate mammary tumor-CAF interactions.The specific binding of FITC-Pep 2 to intact MDA-MB-231 cells encouraged further functional testing (Figure S4A). Although proliferation of MDA-MB-231 exposed to Pep 2 is not affected, cell migration and matrigel invasion are definitely prevented by Pep 2 (Figure S4B\u2013D). To investigate the effects of Pep 2 in the mammary TME context, M-CAFs were pre-treated with Pep 2 (contraction) or diluents (NT), before to be mixed with neutralized collagen type I solution. The contraction phase lasted 2 weeks, and fresh Pep 2 was included every 3 days. Then, Pep 2 was removed, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells were seeded for starting the invasion phase, in presence (invasion) or in absence of Pep 2 (contraction). After 6 days, evaluation of breast adenocarcinoma invasion was carried out, as described for the assay shown in Figure 3B,C, and matrix sections were analyzed by immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-cytokeratin pan mixture (Pck), to distinguish epithelial MDA-MB-231 cells from M-CAFs, not expressing this epithelial marker (Figure 7A). As shown in Figure 7B the number of invading MDA-MB-231 cells decreased by 50% after 6 days of invasion in the presence of Pep 2, compared to control MDA-MB-231 (Figure 7B). If CAF-matrices are exposed to Pep 2 only during the contraction phase, an about 50% decrease of mammary cell invasion resulted, suggesting a relevant contribution of matrix fibroblasts to the inhibition of tumor invasion. The finding that M-CAFs express about 80% of the \u03b1v integrin expressed by MDA-MB-231 well agrees with the robust inhibitory effect of Pep2 included in the contraction phase.Next, we investigated whether the peptide-dependent impairment in mammary tumor invasion may be caused by a decreased secretion of motogen factors by Pep 2-treated CAFs, as observed for peptide-exposed and \u03b1v-lacking TIFs. Therefore, the CM of M-CAFs fibroblasts treated with either Pep 1 or Pep 2 were collected and employed as chemoattractants for MDA-MB-231 in directional migration assays. Figure 7C shows that CM from peptide-treated fibroblasts lost the ability to chemoattract breast adenocarcinoma cells. To compare \u03b1v integrin expression levels and sensitivity to the inhibition by Pep 2, a directional migration assay with mammary H-CAFs and M-CAFs was set up. We found that M-CAFs were the most sensitive to Pep 2 inhibition (Figure 7D). The inset to Figure 7D shows a comparison among \u03b1v integrin protein levels of TIFs, H-CAFs and M-CAFs, highlighting that M-CAFs lysates also contain the highest level of \u03b1v integrin. Finally, exposure of M-CAFs to Pep 1 or Pep 2 induces a 50% and 70% decrease of \u03b1-SMA protein levels, respectively (Figure 7E). These findings suggest that breast CAFs expressing \u03b1v integrin may be targeted by the novel decapeptides, and that this interferes with secretion of chemotactic factors, \u03b1-SMA expression, and ability to elicit invasion of breast carcinoma cells.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we investigated the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of two urokinase-derived, novel decapeptides, co-targeting tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts.Firstly, the cyclic Pep 2 could significantly reduce the number and the size of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells metastases to the lungs of nude mice. Second, both peptides proved to be potent inhibitors of myofibroblasts in 3D-organotypic co-cultures, as peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts or CAF from breast carcinoma patients lose their ability to stimulate matrix invasion of HT1080-GFP fibrosarcoma or MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells, respectively. Third, following exposure to either peptides, CAFs exhibit decreased \u03b1-SMA levels, and to mobilize tumor cells.Also, specific binding assays with cells expressing reduced or enhanced \u03b1v levels identified \u03b1v-integrin as the Pep 2 molecular target. Finally, TIFs, either exposed to Pep 2, or silenced for \u03b1v integrin, exhibit a reduced ability to chemoattract cancer cells and to contract collagen matrices, together with reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) levels. In conclusion, the novel peptides, neither affect the extent of HT1080 and TIFs proliferation, nor the level of apoptosis. Also, they do not interfere with HT1080 or TIFs cell adhesion (Franco P. and Stoppelli M.P., Signaling effects of Pep 2 via \u03b1v-Integrin, unpublished). In contrast, these compounds strongly inhibit migration and invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells, as well as migration, matrix contraction and \u03b1-SMA expression of TIFs and primary CAFs. These data uncover the ability of two novel peptides to counteract tumor invasion through binding to the \u03b1v integrin subunit and down-modulation of the CAF phenotype.As heterodimeric primary receptors in cell-matrix adhesion, integrins recognize binding motifs in ECM proteins, but they can also promote stemness and survival in a ligand-independent manner. Among them, the heterodimeric \u03b1v integrins, namely \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, and \u03b1v\u03b28 are overexpressed in primary bladder, colorectal, breast, lung, renal and melanoma tumors, and expressed at higher levels in the corresponding brain metastases. In particular, the integrin subunit \u03b1v gene ITGAV is overexpressed and associated with progression and spread of colorectal cancer. Overexpression of ITGAV is associated with poor relapse free survival of breast cancer patients. Silencing of ITGAV inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal of breast cancer cell lines by altering expression of BCL2 and PXN.The decapeptides presented here bind to \u03b1v integrin subunit and inhibit migration, invasion and in vivo dissemination of fibrosarcoma and mammary adenocarcinoma cells. Target specificity is shown by the reduced binding of FITC-Pep 2 following \u03b1v-interference, or exposure to anti-\u03b1v blocking antibodies as well as increased peptide binding following \u03b1v overexpression. Furthermore, we show that silencing of \u03b1v integrin expression in TIF fibroblasts leads to an impairment of their matrix contraction ability, to a decrease in the contractile \u03b1-SMA protein levels and to the inhibition of fibroblast ability to stimulate invasion of fibrosarcoma and breast adenocarcinoma cells. These findings indicate the occurrence of an \u03b1v-dependent, partial loss of CAF-like phenotype, as shown by the \u03b1-SMA decreased and CAV-1 increased levels. The strict similarities of the functional effects of \u03b1v reduced expression, and those observed in peptide-exposed TIF further support the central role of \u03b1v integrin in our system.In human breast tumors, highly metastatic and poor clinical outcomes are associated with ECM stiffening, also depending on the activation of mechanotransduction pathways through integrin-dependent signaling. Indeed, the myofibroblast-like properties of CAFs are relevant to the generation of a stiff ECM within the TME that supports invasive tumor growth. Interestingly, the ability of fibroblasts to contract connective tissue matrices generates tractional forces, and a rigid ECM, that is sensed by tumor cells migrating preferentially toward stiffer surfaces. Not only chemotactic gradients, but also increased local ECM stiffening may cause increased migration toward the areas of higher ECM rigidity via mechanosensing, a mechanism by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into signal transduction activity. Here, we show that peptide-exposed TIF fibroblasts are impaired in their matrix contraction ability, producing softer matrices than the untreated counterparts (Figure 5A,B and Figure 6D). This finding indicates that Pep 1 and Pep 2 interfere with CAF ability to establish a pro-metastatic environment, also considering that matrix stiffness and crosslinking is associated to enhanced integrin signalling and tumor progression. Therefore, the ability of Pep 1 and Pep 2 to reduce matrix stiffness of TIF fibroblasts may account, at least in part, for their impaired pro-invasive capacity (Figure 4). In general, the two novel decapeptides induce a partial reversion of the CAF-like phenotype, including the ability to produce stiff matrices.In general, the activity of peptides has received increasing attention: peptides display a greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity than small-molecule drugs, with few off-target effects. Moreover, peptides are applicable as lead compounds for pharmacophores or to the design of drug-like molecules with incorporated secondary structural elements. Pep 1 and Pep 2 decapeptides share some similarities with an 8-mer capped peptide corresponding to residues 136\u2013143 of human uPA and denoted \u00c56 (Table 1). This peptide is endowed with a clear-cut biological activity, as it inhibits angiogenesis and metastases of rat breast cancer cells. The clinical studies indicated that in phase I trials, in gynaecologic malignancies, \u00c56 was well tolerated, without any immunogenic response. Importantly, a randomized, double-blind, phase II study pointed to a statistically significant delay in time to clinical progression. Although the authors report a specific interaction of \u00c56 with CD44, we have previously shown that \u00c56 competes with CPp (corresponding to residues 135\u2013158 of human uPA) for binding to \u03b1v integrin, suggesting that all peptides, derived from the N-terminal region of uPA CP, share the same target integrin. Moreover, Baggio et al. have found that \u00c56 does not interact significantly with recombinant hCD44(21\u2013178). Pep 1 was designed on the basis of the 3D structure of our previously published uPA-derived peptides and Pep 2 may be considered as a conformationally constrained analog of Pep 1. Elongation of \u00c56 to Pep 1 and its subsequent cyclization to Pep 2, aimed at stabilizing the active conformation of anti-migratory \u00c56-like peptides, led to a 30-fold decrease in the IC50 in HT1080 cell migration assays (Stoppelli M.P.; Carotenuto A.; et al.; Patent n.10201800010511). Peptide cyclization results in a further 3-fold decrease in the IC50, as shown in Figure S1A. In fact, the well-defined 3D structure of Pep 1 consists in a \u03b2-turn with a tip on residues Pro141-Glu142 flanked by two strain regions connected by a salt bridge involving the side chains of Glu138 and Lys145 (Figure 1). The peptides presented here have a high affinity for the target: in migration assays with HT1080 fibrosarcoma, with breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 and TIF fibroblasts, the IC50 of uPAcyclin ranges from 5 to 100 pM, all definitely lower than the reported \u00b5M concentrations of the small cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide.In this study, we have not determined the identity of the integrin \u03b2 monomer/s associating to \u03b1v subunit in the cells examined; however, in our previous studies we have shown that uPA-derived peptides interact with \u03b1v\u03b25 and not with \u03b1v\u03b23. In TME, integrins modulate CAFs ability to generate and to respond to paracrine signals generated by the epithelial components. Here, we show that \u03b1v integrin is expressed by primary breast CAFs and that its expression level correlates with the extent of inhibitory response to the uPAcyclin (Figure 7D). Furthermore, organotypic assays show that cancer cells fail to invade collagen matrices if collagen-embedded CAFs were pre-exposed to either peptides (Figure 3B and Figure 7A). These findings encourage targeting of \u03b1v-expressing CAFs with the novel decapeptides, as a therapeutic anti-cancer strategy.Among the anti-integrin drugs, the cyclic pentapeptide cilengitide, binding to the RGD region and selective for \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins, has been tested in clinical trials. Although this drug was well tolerated ad could be safely administered to cancer patients, the results have been discouraging. Among other anti-cancer drugs targeting integrins like \u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, \u03b1v\u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b28, it has been proposed the therapeutic use of anti-\u03b1v antibody abituzumab, in colorectal and prostate cancer, and intetumumab. For \u03b15\u03b21 integrin, the anti-\u03b15 volociximab is available. Clinical studies have shown that they are inefficient in oncological patients, perhaps because of functional redundancy, promiscuity and compensation that extend the effects of the inhibitors in an unwanted manner. A few studies encourage to be cautious, because the continuous administration of low dosage RGD peptides, may stimulate tumor growth and angiogenesis, promoting endothelial induced by VEGF. Despite the failure of anti-cancer treatments based on integrins, current knowledge does not allow to exclude their relevance as targets. An interesting possibility would be to use anti-\u03b1v integrins in solid tumors expressing high levels of \u03b1v integrin and abundant stromal \u03b1v-enriched CAFs. In general, targeting the TME for more efficient anti-cancer therapies is a hot topic, especially for lethal malignancies where the stromal involvement is well recognized, like in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Evidence that treatments targeting both the tumor epithelia and the surrounding CAFs can extend the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies is provided by the retinoic acid receptor \u03b2 and androgen receptor antagonists identified for concurrent therapy with cisplatin. FAP-\u03b1, is a major target in TME with the oral proteolytic inhibitor talabostat. A combination therapy of doxorubicin with pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent and a TGF\u03b2 antagonist has great potential for the therapy of triple negative breast cancer targeting tumor-stroma interactions. Our previous results indicated the relevance of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-2) in the early breast epithelial-fibroblasts crosstalk, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of OSI-906, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of IGF-1R. In general, understanding the complex interactions engaged by the tumor cells with the surrounding microenvironment may results in more effective co-targeting therapeutic strategies, that may ultimately improve patient outcomes.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell lines and Culture ConditionsThe HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line was purchased at ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection (Genoa, Italy). HEK-293-\u03b1v, clone 38 cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HEK-293 with pcDNA3-\u03b1v as described previously. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line was also purchased from the ICLC Interlab Cell Line Collection. HT1080-GFP cells were obtained after stable trasfection of HT1080 cells with pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech-Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA, USA), encoding green fluorescence protein (GFP). MDA MB-231 cell line derived from a human breast adenocarcinoma, was a gift of M.V. Carriero, National Tumor Institute IRCCS-Fondazione Pascale, (Naples, Italy). P19 cell line derives from a murine embryonic teratocarcinoma and was provided by A. Cimmino, IGB-CNR (Naples, Italy). Telomerase-immortalised primary dermal fibroblasts or TIF, derived from biopsies of human forearm, were a gift of Prof. P. Timpson, Garvan Institute of Medical research (Sydney, Australia). CAFs were isolated from two breast adenocarcinoma patients (M and H) and described in a previous study. All cell lines and primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin (100 U/mL)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/mL), at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).4.2. Peptide SynthesisPeptides were synthesized by using the ultrasound-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis (US-SPPS) Fmoc-based strategy. In particular, the linear peptide elongation was performed on the Rink amide resin as solid support, by featuring cycles of Fmoc-deprotection (20% piperidine in DMF solution (0.5 + 1 min) by ultrasonic irradiation) and coupling reaction (N\u03b1-Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), COMU/Oxyma (2 equiv each), and DIEA (4 equiv) by ultrasonic irradiation for 5 min) steps. After each reaction, the resin was washed with N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (3 \u00d7 2 mL) and Dichloromethane (DCM) (3 \u00d7 2 mL), and the process was monitored by specific colorimetric assays. Pep 2, carrying the allyl (All)-derived protecting groups on Glu and Lys side chains, was subjected to cyclization on solid-phase to accomplish the lactam bridge, as elsewhere described. Briefly, all and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) groups were simultaneously hydrolyzed by a treatment with a solution of Pd(PPh3)4 (0.15 equiv) and N,N\u2032-dimethylbarbituric acid (NDMBA) (7 equiv) in DCM/DMF (3:2 v/v), for 2 h at room temperature. The resins were filtered and washed, and the allyl-deprotection procedure was repeated once again. After complete removal of the allyl groups, the coupling was performed by using PyAOP (2 equiv) and HOAt (2 equiv), in the presence of DIEA (4 equiv), for 2 h at room temperature on an automated shaker. The peptide-resin was washed with DCM (5 \u00d7 2 mL) and dried. Finally, the Pep 1 and Pep 2 N-terminal ends were acetylated, whereas that of FITC-Pep 2 was conjugated to fluorescein, as reported by Jullian et al..The resin-bound peptides were treated with a cocktail cleavage (TFA/TIS/H2O 95:2.5:2.5 (v/v/v)), at rt for 3 h, to yield crude peptides and their purification was performed by HPLC on a preparative RP C18 column (Kinetex, 5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 21.2 mm, 100 \u00c5, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) using specific linear gradients of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (from 10 to 90% over 30 min) and UV detection at 220 nm. Final products were obtained by freeze-drying the appropriate fractions after removal of MeOH under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. The purity of compounds was ascertained by analytical HPLC analyses, which were performed by a Prominance system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex column (C18, 150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5), and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with detection at 220 nm wavelength by a diode array UV-Vis detector, and by using a gradient elution of MeOH (0.1% TFA) in water (0.1% TFA), over 20 min. All peptide compounds examined for biological activity were purified to >98%, and the correct molecular ions were confirmed by HRMS measurements (LTQ Orbitrap, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in positive ESI mode.4.3. Conformational AnalysisNMR Spectroscopy. Samples were prepared by dissolving peptides in 0.54 mL of H2O and 0.06 mL of D2O (pH 5.5), to obtain a 1 mM final concentration. NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 700 MHz spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a z-gradient 5 mm triple-resonance probe head at 25 \u00b0C. One-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier mode with quadrature detection. The water signal was suppressed by gradient echo; 2D DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the method from States et al.. Data block sizes were 2048 addresses in t2 and 512 equidistant t1 values. Before Fourier transformation, the time domain data matrices were multiplied by shifted sin2 functions in both dimensions. A mixing time of 80 ms was used for the TOCSY experiments. NOESY experiments were run with a 100 ms mixing time. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra, were obtained using the interactive program package XEASY. Almost complete 1H-NMR chemical shift assignments were effectively achieved for Pep 1 and for the main conformer of Pep 2 according to the W\u00fcthrich procedure via the usual systematic application of DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY experiments with the support of the XEASY software package (Tables S1 and S2). The NOE-based distance restraints were obtained from NOESY spectra of Pep 1 (Table S3). The NOESY cross peaks were integrated with the XEASY program and were converted into upper distance bounds using the CALIBA program incorporated into the program package CYANA. Only NOE derived constraints were considered in the annealing procedures. An ensemble of 100 structures was generated with the simulated annealing of the program CYANA. Then, 10 structures were chosen, whose interproton distances best fitted NOE derived distances, and refined through successive steps of restrained and unrestrained energy minimization calculations using the Discover algorithm (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) and the consistent valence force field. The minimization lowered the total energy of the structures; no residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The final structures were analyzed using the InsightII program (Accelrys). Molecular graphics images were realized using the UCSF Chimera package.4.4. Binding AssayHEK-293, HEK-293-\u03b1v, TIF, HT1080 and MDA MB-231 cells were harvested and acid treated, as described in Stoppelli et al.. Then, 2 \u00d7 106 cells/sample were incubated in suspension with 50 nM FITC-Pep 2 in 100 \u00b5L, for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. When indicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with unlabeled Pep 2 or scrambled Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, or with the following antibodies: VNR147 monoclonal anti-\u03b1v integrin and polyclonal anti-\u03b13 antibodies (Chemicon Int. Inc., Temecula, CA, USA), polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (N-9, Santa Cruz biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), polyclonal anti-actin (A2066, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), monoclonal anti-GAPDH (Ab9484, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or purified vitronectin (VN, Corning, Glendale, AZ, USA). FITC-Pep 2 peptide preparation retained 80% biological activity. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS-0.1% BSA and cell surface-associated FITC-Pep 2 was determined using a fluorimeter (VICTORTM X3-PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).4.5. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysispolyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (Abcam; Ab5694)polyclonal anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-894)monclonal ant-GAPDH (Abcam; Ab9484)polyclonal anti-\u03b1v (Millipore; Ab1930)Total protein extracts were prepared from whole cells as described, resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and probed with the following primary antibodies:As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Sigma; A-6154) or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-2005) were used. The peroxidase activity was measured with ImmobilionTM Western, Chemiluminescent HPR Substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore). Films were imaged using the CanoScan 4400F (Canon, Ohta-ku, Tokyo, Japan) at 300 dpi, with the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite 2 or CS2 and bands quantified with the ImageJ 1.52a software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).4.6. Apoptosis AssayCell apoptosis was measured using Promega Caspase 3/7 Glo reagent (Promega, Milan, Italy). TIF fibroblasts or HT1080-GFP were seeded in 96 wells white plates for 24 h in DMEM-10% FBS and serum-starved for 6 h. Then, they were treated with DMEM-10% FBS or DMEM, in the presence or in the absence of 100 nM Pep 2. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed with 100 \u03bcL of Caspase-Glo 3/7 buffer, containing luminogenic caspase substrate (tetrapeptide sequence DEVD) and, after 15 min, the luminescent signal, that is proportional to the amount of caspase activity, was measured at a luminometer (GloMax\u00ae96, Promega), according to the manufacturer\u2032s instructions.4.7. RNA SilencingSilencing of \u03b1v integrin was accomplished by the esiRNAs mixture (#EHU002301, Sigma-Aldrich) targeting human ITGAV (esiRNA1, NCBI accession no. NM-002210, ). Cells were transfected by the \u201cfast-forward\u201d protocol using HiPerfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, HT1080 cells (1.25 \u00d7 105 cells/sample) or TIF fibroblasts (5 \u00d7 104 cells/sample) were seeded in 6 well plates in DMEM-10% FBS, grown for 24 h and then transfected with a mixture containing 60 nM or 30 nM \u03b1v-targeting (for HT1080 or TIF, respectively) or control siRNAs in serum-free medium using HiPerfect. Protein expression was tested 48 or 72 h later by western blotting.4.8. Tail Vein Assay of Lung MetastasisTo assess HT1080-derived lung metastases, 5\u20136-week-old female BALB/c (nu/nu) mice were employed (Charles River Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All animal experimental procedures were performed in agreement with national and international laws and guidelines on animal welfare and were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health-Animal Welfare Direction (Protocol No. DGSAF21940-A, approved on 16 November 2013. Animals were randomized into four experimental groups, including 5 mice each: Group 1, healthy animals; Group 2, injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells at day 0 and at day 2; Group 3, mice treated at day 0 and day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 15 at mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 HT1080 cells (pre-treated with 1 \u03bcM Pep 2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h). Group 4, mice treated at day 0 and at day 2 with one dose of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg and after 1 h injected with 1 \u00d7 106 cells HT1080 previously treated with 1 \u00b5M Pep 2. After intravenous injection in the tail vein, all animals were subjected to treatment for 28 days with different drug regimens. Group 1 and group 2 animals were treated with vehicle (PBS 1\u00d7), whereas group 3 mice were treated daily with ten doses of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg and, then, treated with one dose of Pep 2 at 15 mg/kg each six days. Group 4 mice were treated daily with 28 doses of Pep 2 at 3.4 mg/kg. Mice weight, breathing rate and overall health were daily monitored.4.9. Ex Vivo Lung AnalysisAfter 28 days, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and lungs were surgically removed. For each mouse, one lung was placed in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C to be used for human DNA content quantitation (Section 4.10). Instead, the other lung was fixed in buffered 4% formaldehyde, paraffin embedded, 5 \u00b5m sectioned (RM2245, Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E-staining) to observe intra-parenchymal and sub-pleural lung metastatic foci. Lung sections were viewed using Digital Image Hub 12.3.3.7055 software (Leica Microsystems) and images were captured at 4\u00d7 magnification.4.10. Quantification of Human DNA in Murine LungsGenomic DNA from the whole lung samples was extracted using RNase A, proteinase K and phenol-chloroform. 50 ng of DNA were used as template for Semi-Quantitative PCR reactions (T100 Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). The DNA was incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL, containing 1\u00d7 Reaction Buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Cat #EME010001, EuroClone, Milan, Italy), 200 \u03bcM dNTP mixture and 5 mM MgCl2. Primers targeting human Alu sequence: (FW 5\u2032-CACCTGTAATCCCAGCACTTT-3\u2032/RW 5\u2032-CCCAGGCTGGAGTGCAGT-3\u2032) were employed to a final concentration of 0.5 \u03bcM. PCR products were separated by agarose electrophoresis, and the bands quantified through the ImageJ software. The number of human cells was calculated by comparing the PCR amplification signals with a standard curve, included in every run, generated by mixing from 1 to 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 cells with P19 embryonic teratocarcinoma cells, keeping 1 \u00d7 107 as total cell number. The signal from the 1 \u00d7 107 HT1080 sample was considered as 100% and DNA from healthy murine lung samples was included in every run as a control. Quantitation of three independent PCR amplification samples, separated on 1% agarose gels is accomplished by ImageJ software and Student t-test.4.11. ImmunofluorescenceFibroblasts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Then, cells were stained with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L AlexaFluor-488 (A-21204, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as described in. Parallel staining with irrelevant primary antibody or secondary antibody were used to control specificity. To stain nuclei, Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (62248, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Captured images were processed through ImageJ software and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured. For immunofluorescence on matrix sections, 5 \u03bcm histological sections were first de-paraffinized and the antigen retrieval was performed by Tris/EDTA (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA) 0,05% Tween 20 pH 9 for 2 h at 60 \u00b0C. Sections were incubated for 1 h in humidified room with blocking solution (1% Milk, 10% Goat Serum, 1% BSA, 1% NaN3, 0,1% Triton X-100, in PBS 1\u00d7), then, incubated at 4 \u00b0C over night with monoclonal pan-cytokeratin antibody (mouse monoclonal pan mixture clones C-11, PCK-26, CY-90, KS-1A3, M20, A53-B/A2, C25-62 (Sigma-Aldrich; C2562) diluted 1:400 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS 1\u00d7, sections were incubated with monoclonal donkey anti-mouse IgG Alexafluor 594 (Abcam), 1 h at room temperature (1:400 in blocking solution). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining, incubated 10 min at room temperature and sections were mounted with hydrophilic Mowiol 488. Sample observations have been performed at the Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope at various magnifications for the production of images subsequently analyzed with the software \u201cLeica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Software\u201d (Leica Microsystems).4.12. Migration AssaysBoyden chambers assays were performed using 8 \u00b5m-pore-size PVDF-free filters coated with collagen type VI in directional migration assay, as described previously. Briefly, HT1080, HT1080-GFP or TIFs were pre-treated for 1 h with Pep 1 or Pep 2 at the indicated concentrations, as described in the relative figure legends. Cellular migration was tested for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C toward DMEM-3% FBS, or serum-free TIFs CM. For invasion assays, filters were further coated with Matrigel 50 \u00b5g/mL (Sigma-Aldrich), and HT1080 cells invaded for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C towards DMEM-3% FBS. At the end of both assays, cells on the lower filter surface were fixed, stained with haematoxylin and counted under an inverted microscope at 20\u00d7 magnification. For scratch wound healing assay, TIFs or HT1080 were grown until confluence in 12 multi-well plate containing culture inserts for live cell analysis (Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and pre-treated with Pep 1 or Pep 2 peptides or diluents for 1 h in serum-free medium for at 37 \u00b0C and then exposed to 1% FBS.Wound healing assay was performed for 24 h, until scratch closing. Images were captured at the indicated time points at Leica DMI600B fluorescence microscope and analyzed with the Leica Application Suite Software (Leica Microsystems). The extent of wound closure is expressed as average decrease in wound distance in three points, considering as 100% the distance between the monolayer margins, at the time of wound formation.4.13. Matrix Contraction AssayTIFs (5 \u00d7 104) were resuspended in DMEM-10% FBS, mixed with a neutralized collagen I solution, in the presence of the indicated peptides and the diameter of matrices was monitored. Matrix area with untreated TIFs at day 2 was considered as 100%. The 594-PSR picrosirius red staining of fibrillar collagen was performed according to Alcaraz et al.. Sections were observed at 20\u00d7 magnification and densitometric quantitation of fluorescence signal was performed with ImageJ software.4.14. Organotypic Invasion AssayInvasion of tumor cells through collagen I matrices including TIF or M-CAF cells was performed as described. Briefly, fibroblasts were embedded in a neutralized collagen I solution, extracted from tendon of adolescent rat tails, and allowed to contract matrices in 35 mm plates in DMEM-10% FBS for 3 days (TIFs) or for a week (M-CAFs), in the presence or absence of Pep 1 or Pep 2, as indicated. Then, HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 were grown on matrix top for 2 days in 24 well plates and matrices transferred to an air-liquid interface on a steel greed in 60 mm plates for the invasion phase. After 7 days, matrices were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin embedded, sectioned and processed for H&E or DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich C2562) and with a secondary donkey anti-mouse antibody (Alexafluor 594). For quantitation of matrix invasion by HT1080-GFP or MDA-MB-231 cells, only images of fluorescence-emitting samples from a wavelength between 375 and 495 nm or 561 and 594 nm, respectively, were employed. Invading cells were counted in rectangular shapes selected on each matrix section image. The number of infiltrating cells into matrices was counted by ImageJ software and compared to untreated matrices and to the initial inoculus in the \u201cseeding phase\u201d (T0).4.15. Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation of at least three separate experiments, indicated by error bars, performed in triplicate, unless otherwise specified. Differences between data sets were determined by the Student t test. Differences described as significant are indicated in the figures with p values \u2264 0.05 (*), \u2264 0.005 (**), or \u2264 0.001 (***).5. ConclusionsMany current therapeutic approaches primarily target the growing solid tumors, largely ignoring the surrounding microenvironment. A great deal of findings has convincingly revealed the tumor promoting effects of CAFs, the most dominant cell type in TME. Here, we present two novel \u03b1v integrin binding decapeptides, inhibiting invasion of HT1080 and MDA MB-231 tumor cells as well as the pro-invasive activity of primary breast CAFs, reducing their \u03b1-SMA level and matrix contraction ability. These results may open new therapeutic perspectives on the use of these peptides as lead compounds for novel strategies to target breast CAFs.6.

        "title": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Promotes the Differentiation of Adipose Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts, Induced by Breast Cancer Cells.",
        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "title": "Chaotic neovascularization induced by aggressive fibrosarcoma cells overexpressing S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase.",
        "content": "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines essential for cell proliferation. Overexpression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase in rodent fibroblasts led to aggressive transformants (Amdc-s cells) that had unforeseen high invasive capacity in nude mice, invading rapidly from the subcutaneous injection site into the peritoneal cavity and its organs. In vitro, these cells were much more invasive than Ras-oncogene-transformed fibroblasts, or human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In immunohistological characterization, Amdc-s-induced tumors showed chaotic neovascularization, with abundant pleomorphic vessel-like structures that had noncontiguous or totally missing laminin (basement membrane) and CD31 (endothelial cell) immunoreactivity. Gene expression and protein analyses of Amdc-s cells showed them to overexpress several pro-angiogenic molecules, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), and to exhibit profound down-regulation of the anti-angiogenic thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). By reintroduction of TSP-1 into Amdc-s cells, the high invasiveness was efficiently inhibited in vitro. Interestingly, Amdc-s cells showed up-regulation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and also expressed the MET receptor, creating thus an autocrine loop able to regulate VEGF-A and TSP-1 levels. Further, we found Amdc-s cells to express increased amounts of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and the large isoform of tenascin-C (TN-C), which may also contribute to the angiogenic switch and invasiveness. Consequently, Amdc-s cells offer an excellent model to sort out the key molecules of aggressive tumor growth, and thereby help in designing rational, novel anti-vascular and other cancer therapies.",

        "title": "Targeting multiple tyrosine kinase receptors with Dovitinib blocks invasion and the interaction between tumor cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer.",
        "content": "A constitutive and dynamic interaction between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma is a prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (collectively called cancer associated fibroblasts, CAFs) often represent the major cellular components of tumor stroma. Tumor cells secret different growth factors which induce CAFs proliferation and differentiation, and, consequently, CAFs secrete different chemokines, cytokines or growth factors which induce tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In this study we showed here that CAFs from breast cancer surgical specimens significantly induced the invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Most interestingly, the novel multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor Dovitinib significantly blocked the CAFs-induced invasion of breast cancer cells by, at least in part, inhibition of the expression and secretion of CCL2, CCL5 and VEGF in CAFs. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling could be responsible for the effects of Dovitinib, since Dovitinib antagonized the promoted phosphorylated Akt after treatment with PDGF, FGF or breast cancer cell-conditioned media. Treatment with Dovitinib in combination with PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling inhibitors Ly294002 or RAD001 resulted in additive inhibition of cell invasion. This is the first in vitro study to show that the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor has therapeutic activities against breast cancer metastasis by targeting both tumor cells and CAFs. ",

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

        "title": "Caveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblasts.",
        "content": "We have recently proposed a new model for understanding tumor metabolism, termed: \"The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer Metabolism\". In this new paradigm, catabolism (autophagy) in the tumor stroma fuels the anabolic growth of aggressive cancer cells. Mechanistically, tumor cells induce autophagy in adjacent cancer-associated fibroblasts via the loss of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which is sufficient to promote oxidative stress in stromal fibroblasts. To further test this hypothesis, here we created human Cav-1 deficient immortalized fibroblasts using a targeted sh-RNA knock-down approach. Relative to control fibroblasts, Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts dramatically promoted tumor growth in xenograft assays employing an aggressive human breast cancer cell line, namely MDA-MB-231 cells. Co-injection of Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts, with MDA-MB-231 cells, increased both tumor mass and tumor volume by ~4-fold. Immuno-staining with CD31 indicated that this paracrine tumor promoting effect was clearly independent of angiogenesis. Mechanistically, proteomic analysis of these human Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts identified &gt; 40 protein biomarkers that were upregulated, most of which were associated with i) myofibroblast differentiation, or ii) oxidative stress/hypoxia. In direct support of these findings, the tumor promoting effects of Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts could be functionally suppressed (nearly 2-fold) by the recombinant over-expression of SOD2 (superoxide dismutase 2), a known mitochondrial enzyme that de-activates superoxide, thereby reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress. In contrast, cytoplasmic soluble SOD1 had no effect, further highlighting a specific role for mitochondrial oxidative stress in this process. In summary, here we provide new evidence directly supporting a key role for a loss of stromal Cav-1 expression and oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts, in promoting tumor growth, which is consistent with \"The Autophagic Tumor Stroma Model of Cancer\". The human Cav-1 deficient fibroblasts that we have generated are a new genetically tractable model system for identifying other suppressors of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, via a genetic \"complementation\" approach. This has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of triple negative and basal breasts cancers, as well as tamoxifen-resistance in ER+ breast cancers, which are all associated with a Cav-1 deficient \"lethal\" tumor micro-environment, driving poor clinical outcome.",

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

Taken together, these studies highlight the critical role of Cav-1 downregulation in maintaining the abnormal phenotype of human breast cancer-associated fibroblasts.IntroductionUntil recently, the study of breast cancer onset and progression has been focused on the epithelial components of the tumor, with little attention given to the surrounding tumor stroma. New evidence has now emerged suggesting a key interaction between mammary epithelia and the adjacent tumor stroma, which is changing the way breast cancer is perceived.During breast cancer onset, a developmental switch occurs, changing the normal stroma composed of fat, basement membrane and fibroblasts, to a desmoplastic or reactive stroma. This new reactive stroma shows increased collagen and extracellular matrix deposition produced by hyper-proliferative activated fibroblasts, with myofibroblast characteristics. This tumor microenvironment (or cancer stroma) also contains more angiogenic components and increased inflammatory cell recruitment. Interestingly, tumor-associated fibroblasts behave similarly to wound repair fibroblasts, which have increased contractility, and induce angiogenesis, as well as increase epithelial growth through the secretion of cytokines, ECM and growth factors. However, unlike wound-healing fibroblasts, CAFs remain activated and do not undergo spontaneous quiescence or apoptosis, as seen during wound closure.Also, there is increasing evidence suggesting that CAFs could be involved in the degradation of the matrix surrounding the tumor, causing stromal invasion. Indeed, CAFs have been shown to secrete important proteolytic enzymes such as matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs), transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b2, platelet-derived growth factors (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and other growth factors, suggestive an active role in tumor invasion.Caveolins (Cav-1, \u22122 and \u22123) are the principal structural proteins coating caveolae, small omega-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane, measuring 50\u2013100-nm in diameter. In cell culture, the transformation of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with various activated oncogenes, such as H-Ras (G12V), Bcr-Abl or v-Abl causes dramatic reductions in caveolin-1 (Cav-1) protein expression. Interestingly, the levels of Cav-1 protein expression inversely correlate with the ability of these fibroblasts to undergo anchorage-independent growth in soft agar; that is lower Cav-1 levels result in larger colony size. In these cells, Cav-1 behaves as a transformation suppressor protein as anchorage-independent growth can be reversed by the re-expression of Cav-1 via an inducible system. Furthermore, the knockdown of endogenous Cav-1 in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, using an antisense approach, promotes anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice, which again could be reversed by Cav-1 re-expression, demonstrating a direct role for Cav-1 in regulating fibroblast cell growth. Finally, genetic evidence has been presented that Cav-1 functions as a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, as Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) fibroblasts are hyper-proliferative and Cav-1 re-expression drives their arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The ability of Cav-1 to drive cell cycle arrest has been previously mapped to the caveolin-scaffolding domain (residues 82\u2013101), which also functions as a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor. Thus, loss of Cav-1 is a marker of oncogenic transformation in fibroblasts, where it normally behaves as a transformation suppressor that prevents cell cycle progression. These findings may have important implications for understanding the growth-promoting properties of the tumor micro-enviroment. However, the status of Cav-1 expression and function in human tumor-associated fibroblasts has never been assessed.Although CAFs have been shown to demonstrate enhanced proliferation capacity, increased migration, and the ability to enhance tumor growth in co-culture experiments, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating their hyper-proliferative phenotype. Here, we show that Cav-1 levels are decreased in CAFs, when compared to matching normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the same patient. Additionally, we functionally demonstrate that loss of Cav-1 plays a key role in maintaining the hyper-proliferative phenotype of CAFs. Thus, understanding the role of Cav-1 in the proliferation of CAFs could be an important new step in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the tumor micro-environment.ResultsBreast tissue and tumor morphology following surgical resectionIn order to visualize the reactive stroma in breast tumors removed from breast cancer patients, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on each tumor, and compared with matching normal adjacent tissue from the same patient. A representative example is shown in Figure 1A. Briefly, these H&E stained sections show (i) a normal mammary duct surrounded by normal stroma (upper) and (ii) an invasive tumor surrounded by reactive stroma, with an increased population of fibroblasts (lower).Morphology of primary cultures of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)Primary fibroblast cell cultures were generated from the tissues obtained after surgical resection of the breast tumor masses from 11 female patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Figure 1B shows phase images of normal mammary fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from unaffected adjacent tissue (upper) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from the mammary tumor mass (lower). Interestingly, CAFs are more numerous and appear elongated as compared to NFs, suggestive of a transformed phenotype.Caveolin-1 protein levels are decreased in CAFs, consistent with a transformed phenotypeLoss of Cav-1 protein expression has been shown to be a marker of oncogenic transformation in fibroblasts. Thus, we next subjected CAFs and matched NFs from the same patient to Western blot analysis with anti-Cav-1 IgG. The results are shown in Figure 2.Interestingly, when densitometry analysis was performed, Cav-1 levels were significantly decreased in the majority of cases analyzed (8 out of 11 patients examined; Fig. 2A). The immunoblots for Cav-1 are shown in Figure 2B, where the levels of Cav-1 are decreased in CAFs, as compared to matching NFs. The results were normalized against \u03b2-actin. Subsequent analyses were focused on those CAFs with reduced Cav-1 expression, as this appeared to be the predominant phenotype.Breast CAFs are hyperproliferativeTo determine if the CAFs isolated from invasive breast tumor specimens are more proliferative than the normal fibroblasts (NFs) isolated from the same patient, we performed BrdU incorporation assays. BrdU is a pyrimidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA when cells undergo DNA replication following a G1-S transition. When both cell types (CAFs versus NFs) were plated at identical densities and left to grow for 72 hrs, the CAFs incorporated ~3.6 fold more BrdU than their normal counterparts (Fig. 3; p < 0.05). The absorbance (A370 nm\u2013A490 nm) is proportional to the BrdU incorporated by the cells after two hours of incubation with the analogue. It is important to note that similar results were obtained when BrdU incorporation was measured in CAFs and NFs isolated from several different patients who showed decreased Cav-1 levels in their CAFs.Using gene expression profiling to mechanistically dissect the hyper-proliferative phenotype of CAFsTo understand the mechanisms responsible for the increased proliferation in CAFs, we randomly selected three matched pairs of NFs and CAFs (that showed loss of Cav-1 expression), and subjected them to gene expression microarray analyses. Each matched pair of NFs and CAFs demonstrated significant changes in gene expression, with ~1,500 to 3,000 altered transcripts per pair. Thus, we defined gene sets that were commonly upregulated or downregulated in CAFs vs. NFs (See Suppl. Data for a detailed list).By comparing all three pairs of NFs and CAFs, we generated a gene signature that consists of 118 upregulated known genes (Table 1) and 66 downregulated known genes (Table 2) (See also Fig. 4A). All of these genes were changed more than 2-fold.Gene ontology analysis revealed that the 118 upregulated transcripts exhibit a strong enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle control (Table 3). Correspondingly, 44 genes within those upregulated in CAFs (Table 4) are part of an RB/E2F gene signature, associated with RB functional inactivation. Similarly, we found that MET and its co-receptor CD44 are both upregulated and are part of the 118 gene signature, suggesting that the HGF/MET signaling axis is also activated in CAFs. In contrast, the downregulated genes exhibited only a weak enrichment for genes involved in extracellular matrix biology and adhesion.Those genes that were consistently upregulated in CAFs were utilized to cluster a breast cancer data set to determine their impact on disease outcome. Specifically, we observed that the 118 upregulated gene expression signature correlated with an increased risk of recurrence after tamoxifen mono-therapy (Fig. 4B and C). Thus, high expression of the breast CAF gene signature was associated with a 3.8-fold decrease in recurrence-free survival, in patients treated with tamoxifen mono-therapy.Interestingly, Cav-1 transcript levels in CAFs were either increased ~2.3\u20132.4-fold or not changed, suggesting that the loss of Cav-1 protein expression we observed occurs at a post-transcriptional or post-translational level (data not shown).Phospho-RB, PCNA and MCM-7 are increased in CAFs, consistent with cell cycle progressionTo validate the mechanisms responsible for the increased proliferation in CAFs, we analyzed the levels of well established cell cycle regulators such as phospho-RB (Ser 807/811), PCNA, and MCM7 by immunofluorescence. While the normal fibroblasts expressed these cell cycle proteins very faintly, the CAFs showed an increase in all three nuclear markers, as assessed by their co-localization with DAPI (Fig. 5). The images shown are representative of CAFs isolated from several patients, as compared with matching control NFs from the same patient.Treatment of CAFs with a Cav-1 mimetic peptide rescues their hyper-proliferative phenotypeIn order to functionally assess the possible causative role of Cav-1 downregulation in driving the hyperproliferative phenotype of CAFs, we next replaced Cav-1 in CAFs using a cell-permeable peptide approach.As predicted, treatment with a cell-permeable Cav-1 mimetic peptide was sufficient to reverse their hyper-proliferative phenotype, resulting in a 3-fold reduction in cell proliferation, as measured by BrdU incorporation (Fig. 6). In accordance with these results, phosphorylation of RB on serine 807/811 was completely reversed and PCNA levels were drastically decreased (Fig. 7).DiscussionNumerous studies now suggest an important and dynamic role for the tumor micro-environment (cancer-associated stromal tissue) in regulating the growth and metastasis of primary tumors. For example, in co-culture experiments, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) extracted from human breast carcinomas were shown to promote the growth of breast carcinoma cells significantly more than normal mammary fibroblasts (NFs) derived from the same patients. In vivo, CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. Another study demonstrated that prostatic epithelial cells grown in the presence of CAFs become permanently transformed. Importantly, this effect is not observed when normal prostatic fibroblasts are used. Similarly, when exposed to the conditioned media of pancreatic CAFs, pancreatic epithelial cells showed an increase in proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation.Since CAFs are thought to play a key role in tumor growth, understanding the mechanisms governing their hyper-proliferation becomes an important focus for targeted tumor therapies. Very little attention has been given to the mechanisms driving their hyperproliferation. To address this issue, we isolated mammary fibroblasts from invasive breast tumors and adjacent normal tissue from the same patient. Then, we subjected these CAFs to a detailed phenotypic analysis. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the Cav-1 protein is downregulated in human breast CAFs. Importantly, Cav-1 is a well-known marker of oncogenic transformation in fibroblasts. Loss of Cav-1 expression in CAFs did not seem to be related to the patient\u2019s tumor grade, or breast cancer marker status (ER, PR or Her2), indicating that loss of Cav-1 expression may be a generalized or common event involved in breast cancer initiation.Next, we used transcriptome analysis (gene expression profiling) to gain mechanistic insight into the hyper-proliferative phenotype of CAFs. Interestingly, our results directly show the dramatic upregulation of a gene expression profile that is known to be part of an RB/E2F gene signature. More specifically, these genes are known to be upregulated when RB is deleted and E2F activity is increased. It is important to note that breast cancer patients that exhibited the high expression CAF signature had a poor prognosis on Tamoxifen monotherapy, with greater than a 3.8-fold reduction in recurrence-free survival. Importantly, this same proliferative gene expression signature has been associated with poor disease outcome in multiple settings, suggesting that gene expression within stromal compartments may be similarly relevant for predicting disease outcome.Normally, when RB is hypo-phosphorylated in quiescent or differentiated cells, it interacts with and sequesters E2F family transcription factors, repressing the transcription of genes essential for cell cycle progression. Replication factors such as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) and MCM7 (Minichromosome Maintenance Protein) are well-characterized RB target gene products. PCNA is a transcription factor which helps the DNA polymerase delta bind to DNA. When MCM7 is bound to RB, it inhibits DNA replication and when RB is phosphorylated it releases MCM7 and promotes its assembly in the pre-replicative complex. Interestingly, MCM proteins have been shown to be regulated by oncogenes.To validate our DNA microarray results, we examined the state of RB-phosphorylation in NFs and CAFs. As predicted, RB was hypo-phosphorylated in NFs and hyper-phosphorylated in CAFs, as demonstrated using an antibody specific for the phospho-serine 807/811 site within the RB protein product. Also, the levels of PCNA and MCM7 were increased in CAFs, consistent with RB inactivation by hyper-phosphorylation. This increase in PCNA and MCM7 in response to RB inactivation was previously demonstrated in other cell systems. For example, a complete knockdown of RB in MCF7 cells with a shRNA causes an increase in PCNA and MCM7 protein levels, when compared to vector alone transfected cells. In RB loxP/loxP mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs), in which the RB gene was excised/inactivated with CRE recombinase, PCNA and MCM7 were also greatly increased as compared with RB (+/+) positive cells.Thus far, we have demonstrated that CAFs show Cav-1 downregulation, RB hyper-phosphorylation, and the upregulation of a gene signature associated with RB inactivation. To establish a cause-effect relationship between Cav-1 protein expression and RB activation status, we functionally replaced Cav-1 in CAFs using a cell-permeable Cav-1 mimetic peptide. This peptide was previously shown to block tumor progression in mice as shown by a reduction in Evans blue extravasation within the tumor. In a different study, the administration of this Cav-1 peptide has also been shown to decrease inflammation in carrageenan-injected mice. We have also previously demonstrated that this Cav-1 mimetic peptide can be used to prevent the development of right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary artery medial hypertrophy in a monocrotaline rat model.Interestingly, functional replacement of Cav-1 in CAFs reverted their hyper-proliferative phenotype almost to the level of normal fibroblasts, as shown by decreased BrdU incorporation and a loss of RB-phosphorylation. This negative regulatory effect of Cav-1 on the proliferation of CAFs is in agreement with its known tumor-suppressor function in both mammary epithelia (MCF-7 cells) and oncogene-transformed NIH-3T3 fibroblasts.Cav-1 has also previously been shown to negatively regulate RB-phosphorylation and PCNA expression in whole animal models, such as Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice. Following carotid artery ligation, Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice develop severe neointimal hyperplasia accompanied by an increase in PCNA expression levels and RB-phosphorylation. In the intestinal epithelium of Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice, PCNA levels are increased compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, genetic ablation of Cav-1 expression in MMTV-PyMT mice (an established mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis) results in dramatic increases in primary tumor formation and lung metastasis. Analysis of primary mammary tumors from these PyMT/Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice reveals dramatic increases in RB-phosphorylation. Interestingly, implantation of PyMT/Cav-1 (+/+) mammary tumor tissue in the mammary fat pads of Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice results in up to a ~2-fold increase in tumor growth, indicating that the mammary stroma of Cav-1 (\u2212/\u2212) mice has tumor promoting properties.In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that Cav-1 is downregulated in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts found within invasive human tumors. Loss of Cav-1 expression can account for their hyper-proliferative phenotype, as replacement of Cav-1 function with a cell-permeable Cav-1 mimetic peptide reverts this hyper-proliferative behavior. We also show that Cav-1 mediates its effects in CAFs via the inhibition of RB phosphorylation and decreases in downstream RB targets such as MCM7 and PCNA. Importantly, these proliferative markers are known to contribute to poor outcome in breast cancer patients. Understanding the role of Cav-1 in regulating the proliferation of CAFs within the cancer stroma will undoubtedly open new possibilities for stromal-targeted therapies to inhibit tumor progression.MethodsMaterialsThe Cav-1 scafolding domain was attached to a biotinylated cell permeable Drosophila antennapedia peptide (AP or Penetratin) [(biotin)-RQPKIWFPNRRKPWKK-(OH)] to generate the following sequence [(biotin)-RQPKIWFPNRRKPWKK-DGIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR-(OH)]. Both peptides (AP and AP-Cav-1) were custom synthesized (at the Tufts University Core Facility). Anti-caveolin-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (N-20) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A mouse monoclonal antibody to \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies [anti-mouse (1:20,000 dilution) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) or anti-rabbit (1:20,000 dilution) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)] were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the super-signal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to MCM7 and PCNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and the rabbit polyclonal phospho-Rb (Ser 807/811) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Fluorescein (FITC) and rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immuno Research (West Grove, PA).Breast tissue samplesAfter informed consent was obtained, breast tissues from cancer patients and normal adjacent tissue from the same patient were collected. The tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and the TNM staging system (AAJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th edition, 2002) along with the Nottingham system, were used to determine the tumor stage for every patient. Tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2 status were also recorded. All tissues obtained were processed within 1-hour of surgical resection to isolate the primary fibroblasts. Breast cancer tissues were obtained from 11 female patients affected by invasive ductal carcinoma, median age of 50.7 years (range 32\u201366), undergoing surgical resection at the Thomas Jefferson University. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Thomas Jefferson University.Culture of cancer-associated fibroblastsMammary fibroblasts were isolated, essentially as previously described. Briefly, 1-hour or less following surgical resection, the tissue samples were washed and kept in PBS containing antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 1.5 g/ml Fungizone) (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) at 4\u00b0C and minced into 1\u20132 mm fragments. Then, the tissues were digested overnight at 37\u00b0C with 0.1% collagenase III (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) in DMEM containing penicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen Corporation). The following day, the epithelial cells were separated from the stromal cells by differential centrifugation, as previously described. The stromal cells were washed in PBS before being plated in 60 mm dishes (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. The cells were grown in 10% DMEM media and changed every other day. All experiments were performed between passages 3\u201310. In addition, another protocol for fibroblasts isolation was performed, as previously described. In parallel, when the tissues were resected, a 1 mm piece of normal and tumor tissue were deposited in a 60 mm dish and left to grow in DMEM 20% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The dishes were trypsinized when a population of fibroblasts appeared around each piece of tissue (2\u20133 weeks). Cells were separated by centrifugation and resuspended in DMEM 10% FBS. Monolayer cultures were grown until 60\u201370% confluence and passaged for a maximum of 10 passages.Western blottingFibroblasts were grown to subconfluency (50\u201360%) in DMEM 10% FBS containing antibiotics and harvested in appropriate volume of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mM octylglucoside), containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Cell lysates were sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 250 (VWR International, West Chester, PA) and centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentrations were analyzed using the BCA reagent (Pierce) and 30 \u03bcg of protein was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and transferred to a 0.2 \u03bcm nitrocellulose transfer membrane (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5% nonfat dry milk). Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 hr followed by washes and 30 min incubation with secondary antibody at room temperature in blocking solution. The immublots were washed and treated with a chemiluminescence substrate and visualized by exposing the film for 30\u201360 sec.BrdU assayCell proliferation was determined using a standard BrdU assay (Roche). The incorporation of a pyrimidine analogue (BrdU) was measured in fibroblasts, as suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, fibroblasts were trypsinized and plated in a 96-well plate (Corning) at a density of 2,000 cells/well. The cancer associated fibroblasts were treated the next day with 5, 10 or 20 \u03bcM vehicle plus peptide (either AP-alone versus AP-Cav-1) for 48 hrs or left untreated. Equal numbers of normal fibroblasts were plated at the same time and left untreated to measure their proliferation. All cells were given a BrdU pulse of 2 hrs at 37\u00b0C.Confocal microscopyFibroblasts were trypsinized and plated on glass coverslips (Fisher Scientific) and left to grow overnight in DMEM 10% FBS. The next day, cells were fixed with cold (\u221220\u00b0C) methanol (Fisher Scientific) for 20 min, washed with PBS (1X) and incubated with primary antibodies at 37\u00b0C in IF buffer (PBS (1X), 5% BSA, 0.5% NP-40) for 45 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS (1X) and incubated with secondary antibodies in IF buffer for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Finally, the cells were washed twice and incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen Corporation) for five minutes, washed and mounted. The cells were imaged with a confocal microscope (Zeis LSM 510). All images were acquired with a 20X objective.Gene profilingGene profiling (DNA microarray) was performed on primary cultures from three different patients with invasive breast carcinomas and compared to their matching NFs. These studies were carried out essentially as we have previously described for other cell types. Briefly, RNA was extracted from fibroblasts by TRIzol method (Invitrogen Corporation) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA was further purified using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Valancia, CA) and reverse transcribed using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen Corporation) and T7-dT24 primer (Sigma Genosys). The single stranded cDNA was converted to double stranded cDNA and purified. The double stranded cDNA was used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA using RNA Transcription Labeling Kit (Enzo, New-York, NY) and the labeled cRNA was purified. The cRNA (15 \u03bcg) was fractionated to produce fragments of between 35\u2013200 bp and hybridized to the human 133A Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The hybridization was carried out in accordance with Affymetrix protocols. The arrays were scanned at 570 nm with a confocal scanner from Affymetrix.Array data analysisAnalysis of the arrays was performed as previously described using the statistical package R and the limma library of the Bioconductor software package. Normalization of the array was performed using a robust multiarray analysis (RMA). A fold change of greater than two was used as a criterion for differential gene expression. Gene ontology analyses was performed using the DAVID 2007 bioinformatics resource. Gene lists were uploaded with the Homo Sapien genome as the background. Microarray data (series GSE1378 and GSE1379) from X.J. Ma et al. were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibusweb site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL1223) and manipulated using GeneSpring GX software (version 7.2) (Agilent Technologies). For each series, the raw data was obtained from GEO as log2 of normalized Cy5/Cy3 ratio, where tumor sample RNA and human universal reference RNA were labeled with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively. The raw data were transformed from log2 to linear values followed by per-gene median normalization in GeneSpring. The expression levels of CAF associated genes were clustered based on standard correlation as the similarity measurement. Subsequently, a condition tree based on distance correlation was created to order the tumor specimens. The quartile exhibiting the highest expression level of the CAF gene signature was utilized to define the impact of the CAF signature on disease outcome. For Kaplan-Meier analysis, statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software.Statistical analysisAbundance of Cav-1 expression in fibroblasts (CAFs and NFs) and BrdU incorporation were analyzed using a two-tailed paired Student t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.Supplementary materials can be found at: www.landesbioscience.com/supplement/MercierCBT7-8-Sup.xlsReferencesSmooth-muscle differentiation in stromal cells of malignant and non-malignant breast tissuesCellular changes involved in conversion of normal to malignant breast: importance of the stromal reactionKnow thy neighbor: stromal cells can contribute oncogenic signalsFriends or foes\u2014bipolar effects of the tumour stroma in cancerMechanisms of myofibroblast activity and phenotypic modulationApoptosis mediates the decrease in cellularity during the transition between granulation tissue and scarMyofibroblasts I.

(A) Representative images of H&E stained sections from the tissues used to generate the primary cultures of breast stromal fibroblasts are shown. Upper and lower panels correspond to normal breast tissue and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), respectively. The stroma surrounding the invasive ductal carcinoma is highly reactive, containing many fibroblasts, as demonstrated by small and numerous hematoxylin-stained nuclei. All tumors were matched with normal tissue from the same patient. Images were taken with a 20x objective using an Olympus BX51 microscope, a Qimaging Micropublisher 5.0 camera and iVision software. (B) Phase images of primary cultures of fibroblasts isolated from invasive ductal carcinomas (lower) and matching fibroblasts from adjacent normal breast tissue (upper) of the same patient. Fibroblasts isolated from the breast tumor appear more elongated and spindle-shaped. Images were taken at 10x.Downregulation of Cav-1 protein levels in CAFs versus NFs. (A) Fold changes in Cav-1 protein expression in CAFs vs. NFs generated from 11 breast cancer patients. Patient results were divided into three groups: (A), loss of Cav-1 expression; (B), no change in Cav-1 expression; and (C), increased Cav-1 expression. Note that most of the tumor-associated fibroblasts (from 8 of 11 patients) had a reduction in Cav-1 expression (n = 8), while one had no change, and two showed an increase. Thus, we focused our efforts on the patients showing a loss of Cav-1 expression. G corresponds to group and N to number of patients. (B) Immunoblot analysis of Cav-1 expression shows a decrease in Cav-1 levels in cancer-associated fibroblasts (C) when compared to adjacent normal fibroblasts (N). All the tumors analyzed had a matched normal tissue control from the same patient. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control to assure equal loading. 30 \u03bcg of total protein lysate was loaded in each lane.CAFs exhibit a hyper-proliferative phenotype. Equal numbers of normal and cancer fibroblasts were plated for 72 hrs and given a two hour pulse of BrdU. Using an ELISA kit, the absorbance was then measured at 370 nm with a reference of 490 nm. The absorbance is reflective of the amount of BrdU incorporated by the cells. CAFs show a ~3.6 fold increase in BrdU incorporation. *p < 0.05. Quantitatively similar results were obtained when BrdU incorporation was measured in CAFs and NFs isolated from several different patients.High expression of the breast CAF gene signature is associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen monotherapy. (A) Venn diagrams summarizing how the two gene signatures were derived by comparing and intersecting the gene sets from matched NFs and CAFs from three different patients. (B) Gene expression data from 60 ER-positive human breast tumors that were both micro- and macrodissected were analyzed for the expression pattern of 118 genes upregulated in CAFs. A core of proliferation associated genes that are regulated by the RB/E2F pathway (marked in red) strongly co-segregated in this analyses. (C) A Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis was conducted, wherein the recurrence of those tumors in the highest quartile of overall expression was compared against the remainder of the cohort (p < 0.001). Patients in the High CAF gene expression group had a poor prognosis on Tamoxifen mono-therapy, with greater than a 3.8-fold reduction in recurrence-free survival.RB phosphorylation and RB-regulated gene products are increased in CAFs. (A) CAFs have increased phosphorylated RB as compared with normal adjacent fibroblasts, as shown by immunufluorescence (Upper panels), using a phopho-specific antibody that recognizes endogeneous RB only when phosphorylated at serine 807/811. (B) CAFs show an increase in the levels of PCNA when compared with normal adjacent fibroblasts, as shown by confocal microscopy (Upper). (C) CAFs show increases in MCM7 expression, as seen by confocal microscopy (Upper). In (A\u2013C), DAPI staining shows the nuclei of the cells imaged (Lower). Images were taken at 20x. Virtually identical results were obtained using CAFs and NFs isolated from several different patients. Representative images are shown.BrdU incorporation is inhibited by a Cav-1 mimetic peptide in CAFs. Equal numbers of cancer-associated fibroblasts were plated for 24 hrs and given a 20 \u03bcM dose of a cell-permeable Cav-1 mimetic peptide attached to penetratin. Following 48 hrs of treatment, the cells were given a two hour pulse of BrdU. Using an ELISA kit, the absorbance was then measured at 370 nm with a reference of 490 nm. CAFs show a 3-fold decrease in BrdU incorporation following Cav-1 treatment. *p < 0.05. Equivalent results were obtained using CAFs isolated from several different patients.RB-phosphorylation is inhibited by a Cav-1 mimetic peptide in CAFs. Treatment of CAFs with a Cav-1 mimetic peptide inhibited the phosphorylation of RB as shown by immunufluorescence (Upper), using a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes endogeneous RB only when phosphorylated at serine 807/811. PCNA levels were also decreased by the Cav-1 peptide (Middle). Penetratin (Pen) alone did not affect the levels of phospho-RB or PCNA. DAPI staining shows the nuclei of the cells imaged (Lower). Images were taken at 20x. Virtually identical results were obtained with 5, 10 and 20 \u03bcM dosages of the Cav-1 mimetic peptide.Breast cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) gene signature\u2014upregulated

        "content": "Tumor microenvironment contributes to tumor angiogenesis. However, the role of the activated cancer associated-fibroblasts (CAFs) in angiogenesis is still unclear. Here we report that miR-205/YAP1 signaling in the activated stromal fibroblasts plays a critical role in VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast tumor. <bMethods:</b miR-205 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); YAP1 expression by qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry; IL11 and IL15 expression by qRT-PCR, western blotting and ELISA. Tube formation and three-dimensioned sprouting assays <iin vitro</i, and orthotopic Xenografts <iin vivo</i were conducted as angiogenesis experiments. The mechanism of miR-205/YAP1-mediated tumor angiogenesis was analyzed via overexpression and shRNA, siRNA, or antibody neutralization experiments in combination with anti-VEGF antibody or Axitinib. <bResults:</b miR-205/YAP1 signaling axis activates breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) into CAFs, promotes tubule formation and sprouting of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Rescue of miR-205 in CAFs blunts angiogenesis processes. YAP1, a target of miR-205, does not regulate VEGF expression but specifically enhances IL11 and IL15 expressions, maintaining tumor angiogenesis even in the presence of Axitinib or after exhaustion of VEGF by neutralizing VEGF antibody. IL11 and IL15 released from CAFs activate STAT3 signaling in HUVECs. Blockage of IL11 and IL15 expression in CAFs results in the inactivation of STAT3-signaling in HUVECs and repression of the CAF-induced angiogenesis. The blunt angiogenesis halts the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells <iin vivo</i. <bConclusions:</b These results provide a novel insight into breast CAF-induced tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner.",

However, the role of the activated cancer associated-fibroblasts (CAFs) in angiogenesis is still unclear. Here we report that miR-205/YAP1 signaling in the activated stromal fibroblasts plays a critical role in VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast tumor. Methods: miR-205 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR); YAP1 expression by qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry; IL11 and IL15 expression by qRT-PCR, western blotting and ELISA. Tube formation and three-dimensioned sprouting assays in vitro, and orthotopic Xenografts in vivo were conducted as angiogenesis experiments. The mechanism of miR-205/YAP1-mediated tumor angiogenesis was analyzed via overexpression and shRNA, siRNA, or antibody neutralization experiments in combination with anti-VEGF antibody or Axitinib. Results: miR-205/YAP1 signaling axis activates breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) into CAFs, promotes tubule formation and sprouting of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs). Rescue of miR-205 in CAFs blunts angiogenesis processes. YAP1, a target of miR-205, does not regulate VEGF expression but specifically enhances IL11 and IL15 expressions, maintaining tumor angiogenesis even in the presence of Axitinib or after exhaustion of VEGF by neutralizing VEGF antibody. IL11 and IL15 released from CAFs activate STAT3 signaling in HUVECs. Blockage of IL11 and IL15 expression in CAFs results in the inactivation of STAT3-signaling in HUVECs and repression of the CAF-induced angiogenesis. The blunt angiogenesis halts the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells in vivo. Conclusions: These results provide a novel insight into breast CAF-induced tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner.IntroductionTumor angiogenesis is critical to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In the absence of blood vessels, tumor growth stays at dormancy within the diameter of 1-2 mm. Tumor cells produce chemical compounds to trigger tumor angiogenesis, in which endothelial cells from the existing blood vessels degrade basement membrane, invade through extracellular matrix, and migrate toward the tumors, then proliferate and sprout to form new blood vessels.Angiogenesis is regulated by a balance between proangiogenic and antiangiogenic molecules in the tumor. One of these molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) activates a crucial signaling pathway in tumor angiogenesis by binding to its cognate receptor (VEGFR). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved antiangiogenic drugs including Bevacizumab, Axitinib, Sorafenib and Sunitinib that target VEGF or VEGFR, which have shown clinical efficacies in some patients with colon cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal carcinoma. However, blocking VEGF alone has no meaningful benefit for some cancer patients. For example, anti-VEGF therapy failed to establish overall survival effects for patients with metastatic breast cancer; only 12% of patients experienced prolonged significant overall survival in phase III randomized clinical trials. This suggests that additional factors or pathways independent of VEGF signaling may be implicated in tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, multiple mechanisms have been revealed to induce resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy, including angiogenic factors bFGF, PIGF and PDGF, and pathways of Notch-DLL4 and NRP1-ABL1. These VEGF-independent mechanisms represent potential new therapeutics valuable for improving outcomes for cancer patients.Recently the tumor angiogenic roles of stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment have been investigated extensively. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), neutrophils and mast cells directly stimulate the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells via secreting proangiogenic factors VEGF, IL-8, and TGF-\u03b1. Bone marrow (BM)-derived precursor cells mobilize to tumor tissue and contribute to the newly formed vessels and growth. Extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as fibronectin, collagen, and vitronectin transduce angiogenic signals by binding to integrins on the endothelial cells, inducing their proliferation and migration.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), activated fibroblasts secreting higher levels of cytokines and growth factors, are the major stromal residents in tumor stroma and favor tumor growth and metastasis partly through promoting tumor angiogenesis. The mouse embryonic fibroblasts are recognized to promote angiogenesis and tumorigenesis via VEGF. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that CAF also contributes to angiogenesis by expressing angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 in ovarian carcinoma or by depositing ECM proteins involved in angiogenesis. Fibroblasts that have been \u201ceducated\u201d by skin carcinoma cells have been shown to mediate innate immune cell recruitment and promote tumor growth by stimulating angiogenesis. Interestingly, CAFs from resistant EL4 tumors can also mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy via VEGF-independent PDGF-C signaling. However, the complicated mechanism underlying how the CAFs in breast cancers promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis is not well understood.Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) may be an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis. miRNAs have been shown to signal in tumor cells by regulating angiogenic factors such as VEGF. Specifically, miRNAs may be involved in the control of endothelial cell recruitment and function. miRNA regulates crosstalk between tumor and microenvironment, but miRNAs in breast CAFs that drive the angiogenesis have not been identified. Our previous work identified a set of dysregulated miRNAs in breast CAFs, and miR-205 was found to be significantly downregulated in CAFs, suggesting their essential role in CAF function. It has been revealed that reduced miR-205 expression in breast cancer cells promotes tumor growth, migration and invasion. However, whether the stromal miR-205 in breast CAFs could promote tumor growth and metastasis by orchestrating activation of fibroblasts and stimulating tumor angiogenesis needs to be determined.Yes-associated protein (YAP1) is a core downstream effector of Hippo pathway, regulating organ development, cell proliferation and differentiation. As a transcriptional coactivator, YAP1 interacts with transcription factors (e.g., TEAD family, SMAD), regulating its target genes' functions in many biological processes. Enhanced YAP1 expression has been found in some carcinomas of the lung, prostate, colon, and breast, triggering tumor initiation, reprogramming of cancer cells into cancer stem cells (CSCs), or promoting tumor growth, proliferation and metastasis. Recently, it has been reported that overexpressed YAP1 in cholangiocarcinoma promotes angiogenesis by regulating pro-angiogenic MFAP5 expression. Whether stromal YAP1 in breast CAFs regulates VEGF-independent angiogenesis mechanisms remains to be determined.In this study, we demonstrate that breast CAFs are closely associated with tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner. Reduced miR-205 expression in breast fibroblasts activates NFs into CAFs by targeting YAP1. Particularly, miR-205 and YAP1-mediated CAF activation promotes angiogenesis even in the absence of VEGF signaling. Except for VEGF, IL11 and IL15 are regulated by YAP1 in CAFs and stimulate angiogenesis resistance to anti-VEGF therapy and activate STAT3 signaling in endothelial cells. Rescue of miR-205 or loss of YAP1 in CAFs suppresses tumor growth and metastasis by reducing tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Therefore, our study discloses a previously unknown mechanism by which breast stromal CAF contributes to cancer growth and metastasis by tumor angiogenesis via a VEGF-independent manner, suggesting potential novel therapeutic strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy.Materials and MethodsClinical samplesBreast tumor tissues and their adjacent normal tissues used in this study were obtained from patients with breast cancer at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. None of the patients had previously received radiotherapy or neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. The investigation was approved by the ethics committee of Chongqing Medical University.Stromal fibroblasts isolation, immortalization, and cell cultureCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from breast tumor tissues or their paired normal tissues as described previously. Briefly, fresh tumor tissue and the corresponding normal tissue were washed with sterile PBS containing antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin and 50 \u03bcg/mL gentamycin), minced into small pieces and digested for 8 h at 37 \u00b0C in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.5% mg/mL collagenase type I (Sigma, USA). The digested tissues were carefully pipetted using culture DMEM (Invitrogen, USA), and the mixtures were centrifuged to remove the fat and tissue debris. The mammary tissues were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS (GIBCO-BRL, USA) until the fibroblasts adhered to the dish, and other cellular types in the suspension were removed. Cell purity of stromal fibroblasts was identified by the test of fibroblast biomarker fibronectin (FN), CAFs-specific markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), epithelial cell markers cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18 (CK8+18) and endothelial cell marker CD31. NFs and CAFs were immortalized by human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT) as described previously. NFs and CAFs were culture in DMEM with 10% FBS, and HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Plasmid constructs and reagentsLV3-puro-miR-205 and LV3-puro-anti-miR-205 (the shRNA specifically targeting miR-205) were purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai, China). The pSUPER-vector and pSUPER-miR-205 vector were kindly provided by Dr J\u00f6rg Hackerm\u00fcller (RNomics Group, Germany). The pBABE-YAP1 vector was obtained from Addgene (Boston, USA). Full-length IL11 and IL15 cDNA were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pBABE-puro vector at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The shRNAs specifically against YAP1 were cloned into the lentiviral vector pLVX-shRNA1 (Clontech, USA) at BamHI and EcoRI sites. The siRNA sequences specifically against miR-205 and the genes are listed in Table S1. To generate WT-YAP1 3'UTR-Luc, Mut-YAP1 3'UTR-Luc, IL11 promoter-Luc, and IL15 promoter-Luc reporters, the synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) that correspond to the wild-type or the mutated binding sites of miR-205 in the 3'-UTR of YAP1, and the IL11 or IL15 promoter were separately cloned into the PMIR-Reporter vector (Ambion, USA) at Spe I and Hind III sites.The reagents used in this study in vitro are as follows: Axitinib (Selleck, USA), 5 nM; S3I-201 (Selleck, USA), 20 \u03bcM; MTT (Beyotime, China), 5 mg/mL; for preparation of conditioned medium, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech), 0.2 mg/mL; Neutralizing antibody against IL11 (ab89887, Abcam), 5 \u03bcg/mL; IL15 (MAB2471, R&D Systems), 5 \u03bcg/mL; control antibody (MAB002, MAB003, R&D Systems), 5 \u03bcg/mL.Luciferase assayFor 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay, cells were seeded at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells in 24-well plates and co-transfected with pSUPER-miR-205 and pMIR-YAP1 3'-UTR (wild-type or mutant) and the control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, USA) by using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For promoter reporter assay, cells were co-transfected with shRNA (Control or YAP1), pMIR-promoter (IL11 or IL15) and pRL-TK. Luciferase activities were performed by using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter System (Promega, USA) after 48 h, and normalized by using pRL-TK reporters as an internal control.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)The deparaffinized tissue sections at 4 \u03bcm thick were heated for antigen retrieval at 95 \u00b0C in citric acid buffer (pH 6.0). After treating with 3% H2O2, the sections were blocked with 5% goat normal serum, and incubated with primary antibody against \u03b1-SMA (1:100, ab5694, Abcam), CD31 (1:50, ab9498, Abcam, UK) and YAP1 (1:200, sc-398182, Santa Cruz, USA), separately. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining as described previously. \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and CD31+ endothelial cells were scored by mean optical density (density/area) using Image-pro plus 6.0 software. YAP1 staining in stromal tissues was scored into 5 intensities: 0, no staining; 1+, 1%-25%; 2+, 26%-50%; 3+, 51%-75%; 4+, 76%-100%. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on pre-prepared coverslips for 24 h. After being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated by 0.1% triton-100, and incubated with 5% goat serum, the cells were separately stained with antibody specifically against FN (1:150, ab32419, Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (1:150), FAP (1:150, ab53066, Abcam), cytokeratin (CK8+CK18) (1:200, ab53280, Abcam), and CD31 (1:80) at 4 \u00b0C for overnight, then labelled with FITC-labeled secondary antibody (ZSBIO, China). The nuclei were stained with DAPI and the images were captured by a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope.MTT and Flow cytometric analysisStromal fibroblast cells (3 \u00d7 103 per well) were seeded into a 96-well plate, and cell growth was measured every day by MTT bromide assay at a wavelength of 492 nm on an ultraviolet spectrophotometric reader. Cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle (using standard propidium iodide staining), apoptotic cells (using standard Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide Kit (Beyotime, China)), and stromal fibroblasts were analyzed by flow cytometry with an FCdevice (Beckman, USA). Experiments were repeated in triplicate.RNA extraction and qRT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen). The purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to form cDNA using a reverse transcriptase kit (Takara, China), quantitative real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, Dalian, China). The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in the Table S2.Invasion assaysTranswell invasion assays were conducted using a 8 \u03bcm pore chamber coated with Matrigel (Corning BioCoat, USA) as described previously. Cells were allowed to invade toward medium in the lower chamber, and the invaded cells on the opposite side of the filter were stained with hematoxylin in methanol and counted after 8 h for fibroblasts and 20 h for HUVECs.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and antibody neutralization testThe stromal fibroblasts (1 \u00d7 106) were seeded into a 6 well plate in growth medium for 6 h. After removing the growth medium, FBS-free medium (1 mL) was added to further culture for 30 h, and the supernate was collected as conditioned medium (CM). To exclude the potential side effects of cell proliferation and apoptosis of CAFs and NFs (e.g. the engineered CAFs and NFs , and their control cells) on CM, total cell numbers, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis, and protein concentration (using Bradford assay kit, Beyotime, China) of CM were carefully determined at CM collection time point. For neutralization experiments, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF, IL11, or IL15 was preincubated at 4 \u00b0C with 1 mL supernatant for 6 h, then used for HUVECs co-culture in tubulogenesis or sprouting experiments.Tubule formation and three-dimensional sprouting assaysHUVECs (1 \u00d7 104) were cultured with 150 \u03bcL conditioned medium in 96-well plates precoated with 50 \u03bcL of growth factor-deprived Matrigel. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 6 h, tubule formations were analyzed by using Image J software. For endothelial cell sprouting assays, HUVECs (1 \u00d7 103) were cultured with medium containing 0.24% carboxymethylcellulose in non-adherent round-bottom 96-well plates overnight. Spheroids were collected by centrifugation at 400 xg and mixed with 2 mg/mL fibrinogen (Corning) and FBS-free medium. The three-dimensional fibrin gel was then covered with CM and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 24 h. Endothelial sprouting was analyzed with at least 10 spheroids per group and quantified by recording the branch number under a microscope.Western blotting and ELISA assaysCell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The specific primary antibodies used in Western blotting analysis are as follows: FAP (1:1000, ab53066, Abcam, UK), \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, ab5694, Abcam), IL11 (1:1000, ab89887, Abcam), IL15 (1:800, ab7213, Abcam); VEGFA (1:1000, wl00009b, Wanleibio, China); p-VEGFR2 (1:800, D155165, Sangon, China), T-VEGFR2 (1:1000, D151118, Sangon), p-KIT (1:800, D151515, Sangon), p-PDGFR\u03b2 (1:800, D151409, Sangon); FXR1 (1:1000, BS70701, bioworld, China); YAP1 (1:1000, sc-398182, Santa Cruz, USA); T-STAT3 (1:1000, #4904, CST, USA), p-STAT3 (1:1000, #9131, CST), T-AKT (1:1000, #9272, CST), p-AKT (1:1000, #2965, CST), T-ERK (1:1000, #9102, CST), p-ERK (1:1000, #4348, CST), T-P38 (1:1000, #9212, CST), p-P38 (1:1000, #4631, CST) and \u03b2-Actin (1:1500, ZSBIO, China). For ELISA assay, conditioned medium was collected from 1 \u00d7 106 NFs or CAFs in a 6-well plate, and the concentrations of IL11 and IL15 were measured using a standard ELISA Kit (Raybiotech, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Orthotopic XenograftsThe orthotopic tumor xenografts models were as described previously. Animal experiments were approved by the animal care ethics committees at Chongqing Medical University. MDA-MB-231 cells (1 \u00d7 106) were mixed with equal number of CAF/Ctrl (CAF/miR-Ctrl, CAF/sh-Ctrl) or engineered CAF cells (CAF/miR-205, CAF/sh-YAP1) in 200 \u03bcL of PBS:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice. Tumor size was assessed by caliper measurements every three days; volume was calculated ((L \u00d7 w2) \u00d7 0.5). When the tumor volume was around 100 mm3, the mice implanted with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/sh-Ctrl or CAF/sh-YAP1 were separately fed oral Axitinib twice a day at low- (30 mg/kg, 1 group) or high-concentrations (40 mg/kg, 1 group), or intraperitoneally administered with anti-VEGF antibody (10 mg/kg, three times a week; 1 group) (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech). Control mice received 0.5% Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC; 1 group) or appropriate sterile saline (1 group). At the end of animal experiments, tumors or mice lungs were serially sectioned into 4 \u03bcm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for subsequent blinded evaluation of MVD and metastases in the lungs.TCGA Bioinformatic AnalysisBioinformatic analysis was performed as described. We obtained the clinically annotated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) focused on expressions of miR-205, YAP1 and CD31 in breast cancer patients. To determine the progression free survival of patients, approximately 2/3 of the samples were used as a training cohort to obtain the thresholds yielding the most significant log rank test p-values (one-tailed test), which can divide the data into good and poor prognosis groups. The thresholds were then used to analyze the data in the remaining 1/3 of the samples, which functioned as validation cohort, and p-values were computed for those cohorts. All datasets were applied to assess survival differences between the low-expression and high-expression groups by the Kaplan-Meier curves.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using SPSS 17.0 software. The results are shown as means \u00b1 SD. Multiple groups were analyzed using ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, and single comparison between two groups was analyzed using Student's t-test. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.ResultsBreast stromal CAFs closely correlate with tumor angiogenesis in VEGF-independent signalingWe observed abundant vessel-like structures in breast tumor stroma compared with its non-tumor stromal area by HE staining (Figure 1A) and CD31 staining (a specific biomarker of the vascular endothelial cell) (Figure 1B). Activated CAFs account for nearly 60-80% of breast cancer stroma cells, suggesting that the activated stromal fibroblasts may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. We examined \u03b1-SMA and CD31 protein levels by immunohistochemical staining in tumor tissues and their para-cancer (non-tumor) tissues from 93 breast cancer patients, including 21 with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), 42 with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and 30 with metastatic carcinoma. \u03b1-SMA was negative in stromal fibroblasts in the non-tumor tissues (Figure S1A), while gradually stronger \u03b1-SMA expressions in CAFs and more plentiful microvessel density (MVD) were observed in the advanced breast tumor tissues (Figure 1C, Figure S1B). A positive correlation between the enhanced \u03b1-SMA and MVD was further disclosed by the Pearson's correlation analysis (Figure 1D). These results suggest that CAFs are the potential promoter of breast tumor angiogenesis.Furthermore, the angiogenesis-associated genes and factors classified by gene ontology analysis from mRNA microarray were significantly up-regulated in the primary CAFs (Figure 1E), whose purities were identified by fibroblast biomarker FN, the activated fibroblasts biomarkers, epithelial markers, and endothelium marker (Figure S1C-S1D). To assess whether CAFs affect the angiogenic behavior of vascular endothelial cells, a co-culture system including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs or NFs was employed. The proliferation (Figure 1F), invasion (Figure 1G) and tubule formation abilities (Figure 1H-1I) of HUVECs were dramatically enhanced by CM from CAFs. The addition of Axitinib (an effective inhibitor for activated VEGFR of vascular endothelial cells) (Figure S1E) in CM derived from CAFs or the CM treated with anti-VEGF antibody (Figure S1F) could not completely impede the CAF-induced invasion and tubule formation (Figure 1G-1I). These data suggest that the breast cancer stromal CAFs may contribute to VEGF-independent angiogenesis.Decreased miR-205 in CAFs contributes to breast tumor angiogenesisOur previous studies identified a set of dysregulated miRNAs in CAFs. MiR-205 was down-regulated in CAFs (Figure S2A-S2B), the MDA-MB-231 cell-educated fibroblasts (Figure S2C), and a set of primary CAFs freshly isolated from 21 patients with breast cancer (Figure 2A). Decreased miR-205 expression was found to be associated with higher CD31 levels and worse overall survival of breast cancer patients (Figure 2B, Figure S2D) after analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Similarly, the higher level of CD31 and the abundance of MVD were oppositively corresponding to lower levels of stromal miR-205 in the detected breast tumor tissues (Figure 2C). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the predicted targets of miR-205 were involved in angiogenesis and cell differentiation (Figure S2E). The several known angiogenic factors including VEGFA, TGFB1, IL6 were increased in NF/anti-miR-205 (loss of miR-205 by miR-205 inhibitor in NFs), decreased in CAF/miR-205 (over-expression of miR-205 in CAFs) in comparison to their control cells (Figure S2F). These data indicate that miR-205 in stromal fibroblasts potentially affects angiogenesis in breast tumors.Indeed, miR-205 in stromal fibroblasts is closely related to the pro-angiogenic phenotypes of HUVECs. Impeded miR-205 expression in NFs (NFs/anti-miR-205) was observed using its antisense sequences (anti-miR-205) (Figure S3A), and CM derived from the NFs/anti-miR-205 cells significantly promoted the migration, invasion (Figure S3B-S3C, upper), tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure 2D-2G, upper). Furthermore, after rescuing miR-205 expression in CAFs (CAFs/miR-205) (Figure S3A), CM from these CAFs (miR-205 overexpressing) disrupted the angiogenic potentials of HUVECs (Figure S3B-S3C, down; and Figure S3D-S3G, upper). These findings show that down-regulation of miR-205 in CAFs indeed promotes angiogenesis.VEGF, a major driving factor for tumor angiogenesis, was elevated in miR-205-silenced NFs or repressed in miR-205-overexpressing CAFs (Figure S3H). Interestingly, CM derived from CAFs still kept the ability to promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs in the presence of Axitinib (Figure 2D-2E and Figure S3D-S3E, down panel) or anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 2F-2G and Figure S3F-S3G, down panel). These data suggest a VEGF-independent proangiogenic function of miR-205 in CAFs.YAP1, a downstream target of miR-205, is associated with tumor angiogenesisTo further explore the functions of stromal miR-205 in regulating angiogenesis, we identified target genes of miR-205 by merging results (GSE39735) acquired from GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with miR-205 targets predicted by Target Scan and the up-regulated genes (fold change >2.0) in our previous mRNA expression profiles. We obtained 4 candidate genes including YAP1, HNRNPK, FXR1 and SLC4A4 (Figure 3A). Further analysis confirmed that only YAP1 was significantly changed at mRNA and protein levels in CAFs (Figure 3B-3D). The enhanced expression of YAP1 was observed in 3 immortalized CAFs (Figure 3E). In addition, the potential binding sites of miR-205 were identified in the YAP1 3'-UTR (Figure 3F), which led to a dramatic transcriptional suppression of YAP1 under ectopic expression of miR-205 (Figure 3G). Mutation of the binding sites in the YAP1 3'-UTR abolished the repression of miR-205 to YAP1 (Figure 3G), suggesting that YAP1 is a direct target of miR-205 in CAFs. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, high level of YAP1 was found to be positively related to CD31 expression in breast cancer (Figure 3H) and worse overall survival of breast cancer patients (Figure 3I). The high levels of YAP1 proteins in CAFs were further confirmed in the developed breast tumor tissues (Figure 3J), revealing a close correlation between YAP1 in stromal fibroblasts and MVD in these tissues (Figure 3K).YAP1 activating NFs into CAFs promotes angiogenesis via VEGF independent mannerTo investigate the pro-angiopoietic roles of YAP1 in CAFs, we transfected a retrovirus-mediated ectopic YAP1 construct into NFs, and suppressed YAP1 expression in CAFs using shRNA (Figure 4A, Figure S4A). YAP1-overexpression in NFs (NF/YAP1) or loss of endogenous YAP1 in CAF (CAF/sh-YAP1) resulted in activated NF or inactivated CAF, identified by \u03b1-SMA levels, cell proliferation and migration abilities (Figure 4A, Figure S4B-S4C), indicating that YAP1, as an effector of miR-205, is essential for CAF activation.Furthermore, the acquirement of ectopic YAP1 in NFs or loss of endogenous YAP1 in CAFs had no effect on VEGF expression (Figure 4A, Figure S4D). However, the CM from YAP1-overexpressing NFs promoted cell migration and invasion of HUVECs, and the CM from YAP1 knocked-down CAFs impeded these behaviors in HUVECs (Figure 4B). Correspondingly, CM from YAP1-overexpressing NF cells obviously facilitated the tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure S4E-S4H, upper), and CM from YAP1 knocked-down CAFs decreased HUVECs' tubule formation and sprouting abilities (Figure 4C-4F, upper). Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody could augment these observed effects of YAP1-silenced CAFs (Figure 4C-4F, down). However, overexpression of YAP1 in NFs attenuated the suppressive functions of Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody on tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs (Figure S4E-S4H, down). These findings were further confirmed by YAP1 rescue in miR-205 overexpressing CAFs (CAFs/miR-205), which notably abrogated the anti-angiogenic effects of miR-205 (Figure 4G-4H). These data suggest that YAP1 promotes angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells.IL11 and IL15, the YAP1 targets, display a concordant effect on VEGF-independent angiogenesisBased on the above findings, we proposed that some secreting factors other than VEGF in CAF's CM play a critical role in pro-angiogenesis. However, the known pro-angiogenic factors including SDF-1, VEGFA and FGF2 were not influenced by YAP1 in CAFs and YAP1-overexpressing NFs (NFs/YAP1) (Figure S4D). After careful analysis of the gene profiles from GEO database (GSE7700), which may be directly regulated by YAP1 and our previous mRNA profiles of CAFs by bioinformatics, HMGB1, CXCL14, IL6, IL11 and IL15 were identified as the YAP1-regulated candidate cytokines (Figure 5A). Actually, the mRNA expressions of IL6, IL11 and IL15 were down-regulated in YAP1 knock-down CAFs, and IL11 and IL15 were significantly affected by YAP1 in CAFs (Figure 5B). Overexpression of YAP1 in the miR-205-rescued CAFs (CAF/miR-205/YAP1) dramatically abrogated the suppressive effects of miR-205 on IL11 and IL15 (Figure 5C-5E). Luciferase assay showed that YAP1 could directly regulate IL11 and IL15 transcript expressions (Figure 5F).Following efficient knock-down of IL11 and IL15 in CAFs using their specific siRNA (Figure S5A-S5E), the corresponding CM decreased cell invasion (Figure S5F) and tubule formation of HUVECs (Figure 5G, upper; Figure S5G). Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody treatment further augmented the suppression of tubule formation of HUVECs (Figure 5G, down; Figure S5G). Similarly, CM from CAFs (Figure 5H) or YAP1-overexpressing NFs (NF/YAP1) (Figure S5H) neutralized with anti-IL11 and/or anti-IL15 antibodies reduced the tubule formation of HUVECs. These data suggest that IL11 and IL15, the secreting proteins of CAFs, are essential to breast tumor angiogenesis.IL11 and IL15 derived from CAFs activate STAT3 signaling in endothelial cellsTo understand the functional impact of IL11 and IL15 secreted by CAFs on pro-angiogenesis, the potential downstream signaling of interleukin family (e.g., JAK/STAT, ERK, PI3K/AKT) in HUVECs was examined. As shown in Figure 6A, a high level of phosphorylated STAT3 was detected in HUVECs that were co-cultured with CM derived from NFs/anti-miR-205 and CAFs. Knockdown of YAP1, or IL11, and IL15 in CAFs mitigated the activation of STAT3; simultaneous loss of IL11 and IL15 in CAFs could augment the inactivation of STAT3 in HUVECs (Figure 6A, 6B). However, the activation of VEGFR2 was not affected by these factors, except miR-205 (Figure 6A, 6C). Blockage of STAT3 signaling by inhibitor S3I-201 (Figure S6A) reduced cell invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs (Figure S6B-S6C). Furthermore, transfection of ectopic IL11 and IL15 into NFs significantly increased IL11 and IL15 secretion in the supernatant (Figure S6D-S6F), thus leading to the activation of STAT3 signaling (Figure S6G) and increased invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs (Figure 6D-6E), which could be remarkably abolished by S3I-201 but not Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 6E-6F).In order to adequately assess the pro-angiogenic functions of IL11/IL15 in CM derived from the CAFs, we first evaluated the different types of vectors on some of the molecular biological characteristics of NFs or CAFs. There were no significant differences in cell proliferation (Figure S7A), miR-205 expression (Figure S7B), protein levels of YAP1/IL11/IL15 (Figure S7C), and pro-angiogenic functions (Figure S7D-S7E) between NF/anti-miR-Ctrl and NF/pBABE-Ctrl; or among CAF/miR-Ctrl, CAF/sh-Ctrl and CAF/si-Ctrl (Figure S7A-7E), suggesting negligible side effects of vectors on the inherent biological characteristics of NFs or CAFs. Next, total cell numbers, cell proliferation, cell apoptosis of the used stromal fibroblasts and protein concentrations in the CM from all used stromal fibroblasts were determined at the terminal time point of CM collection. Despite overexpression of miR-205, or knockdown of YAP1, IL11 and IL15 in CAFs decreased cell proliferation, while knockdown of miR-205, or overexpression of YAP1, IL11, and IL15 in NFs increased cell proliferation (Figure S4B, S7F-S7H). In growth medium, the total cell numbers of parent CAFs and NFs, and the engineered CAFs and NFs were almost the same (Figure S8A), and cell proliferation of these cells also had no detectable changes at the terminal time point of CM (Figure S8B). However, the percentage of apoptotic and viable cells were found to be a little bit different among these cell populations (around 2%, P>0.05) (Figure S8C), thus leading to a tiny difference in protein concentrations in their CM (Figure S8D). Protein concentrations in FBS-containing growth medium from these CAFs and NFs also had no significant difference, which may be obscured by serum (Figure S8E). To understand whether IL11 and IL15 in CM are affected by cell apoptosis, the protein concentration of CM derived from activated fibroblasts was normalized using the protein concentration deviation value between activated fibroblasts and the control fibroblasts, and adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration of control cells; then IL11 and IL15 were detected by ELISA assay. IL11 and IL15 protein levels in CM derived from the activated fibroblasts were obviously higher than that in CM derived from the control fibroblasts (Figure S8F-S8G), which is similar to the above results (Figure 5D-5E, S5D-S5E and S6E-S6F). These data demonstrate that CM, especially angiogenic factors IL11 and IL15 derived from the activated stromal fibroblasts, are not affected by cell proliferation and cell apoptosis, but are closely governed by miR-205/YAP1 signaling and play essential roles in breast tumor angiogenesis.CAFs promote tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner to fuel breast tumor growth and metastasis in vivoTo investigate the function of miR-205/YAP1 signaling axis in pro-angiogenesis, MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with CAFs (labeled CAF/miR-Ctrl), CAFs/miR-205 or CAFs/sh-YAP1 were subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Compared with the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with engineered CAFs (CAF/miR-205, CAF/sh-YAP1 (labeled CAF/sh-YAP1/CMC or Sal in Fig 7A)) had fewer blood vessels on the tumor surface, and less MVD and CD31 staining in tumor tissues (Figure 7A; Figure S9A-S9B). In contrast to blockage of VEGF signaling alone by Axitinib or by anti-VEGF antibody, YAP1-knock-down in CAFs combined with VEGF signaling inhibitors could augment the suppressive efficiencies to tumor angiogenesis (Figure 7A; Figure S9A-S9B), indicating that YAP1 acts as an obviously pro-angiogenic effector in the VEGF-independent pathway. Consistently, the levels of IL11 and IL15, the critical pro-angiogenic factors, which are regulated by miR-205 and YAP1 signaling axis, were reduced in the tumors with CAF/miR-205 or CAF/sh-YAP1 compared to their control tumors (Figure 7B). Moreover, phosphorylated STAT3 in tumors with CAF/miR-205 or CAF/sh-YAP1 significantly decreased (Figure 7B). Correspondingly, blockage of VEGF-independent tumor angiogenesis led to decreased tumor growth (Figure 7C, Figure S9C-S9D) and metastases in mice lung tissues (Figure 7D). Collectively, these data support the notion that the decreased miR-205 in CAFs increases the expression of YAP1, IL11 and IL15, and promotes tumor angiogenesis to fuel tumor cell growth, invasion and metastasis (Figure 7E).DiscussionTumor angiogenesis plays a critical role in tumor development. However, how the activated fibroblasts in human breast tumor microenvironment regulate tumor VEGF-independent angiogenesis remains unknown. In this study, we found that the stromal CAFs are closely involved in tumor angiogenesis in breast tumor, in which the activated fibroblasts can recruit and stimulate vascular endothelial cells to form vascular tubes and sprouts, thus enhancing breast tumor cell growth and metastasis in vivo. The downregulated miR-205 and its target YAP1 activate NFs into CAFs and enhance CAF proliferation and migration activities. Furthermore, these activated CAFs induced by YAP1 cannot promote VEGF, but their IL11 and IL15 expressions stimulate angiogenesis, even under the blockage of VEGF signaling by Axitinib and anti-VEGF antibody, suggesting that CAFs can modulate tumor angiogenesis resistance to anti-VEGF therapy via IL11 and IL15. Collectively, our results provide a novel insight into breast CAFs pro-angiogenesis role in a VEGF-independent manner.In this study, we found that the downregulated stromal miR-205 plays a key role in the activation of stromal fibroblasts, thus enhancing angiogenesis. Our findings support that the dysregulated miRNAs are involved in multiple CAF-driven tumor biological processes. For example, downregulation of miR-31 and miR-21 in ovarian CAFs, and miR-15 and miR-16 in prostate CAFs have been shown to promote tumor migration and invasion through reprogrammed CAFs. Furthermore, the downregulated miR-320 in mammary fibroblasts induces oncogenic secretome, which in turn promotes tumor angiogenesis and tumor invasion.Our studies disclose that YAP1, a target of miR-205 in breast CAFs, functions as a critical regulator in activated CAF-mediated tumor angiogenesis. YAP1, the nuclear co-transcriptional factor of the Hippo pathway, has been reported to govern organ size and stem cell differentiation in embryonic development. YAP1 is also recognized as a functional mediator in lung fibroblast differentiation and fibrogenesis. In addition, the oncogenic YAP1 in ovarian cancer promotes tumor cell growth and metastasis, resulting in a poor survival for tumor patients. Here, we found that miR-205 targets YAP1 in CAFs to promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast tumor tissues. Although a high level of VEGF was detected in breast CAFs, YAP1 does not regulate VEGF expression. Furthermore, inhibition of VEGF signaling can't block YAP1-mediated pro-angiogenesis. Similarly, high level of YAP1 has been found in human cholangiocarcinoma to promote angiogenesis by regulating NFAP5 expression. These findings support that YAP1 induces a VEGF-independent pro-angiogenic signature in tumor angiogenesis.Our studies prove that inflammatory factor IL11 and IL15, aside from previously reported FGF2 and SDF1, are novel pro-angiogenic factors regulated by YAP1 in breast stromal CAFs. Previous studies proved that IL11 and IL15 are the cytokines with biological activities towards T-cells. IL15 secreted from uterine nature killer cells induce angiogenesis in endometrium. IL11 and IL15 were then found to have metastatic potential in colorectal cancer cells and act as a chemoresistant factor in lung adenocarcinoma. IL11 or IL15 also have the capacity to promote proliferation of cancer cells. Here, we confirmed that IL11 and IL15 in stromal CAFs, directly regulated by YAP1, act as powerful mediators between CAFs and breast cancer cells to facilitate tumor angiogenesis. The aberrant YAP1 induced by miR-205 in stromal CAFs enhances IL11 and IL15 expressions, but not the known pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF, SDF, FGFs, or PDGF, to stimulate the STAT3 activation and promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs. Application of Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody alone in either the co-culture system of HUVECs and CM derived from CAF, or in tumor-burdened mice in vivo, resulted in vascular endothelial cells retaining their angiogenic properties. Axitinib or anti-VEGF antibody combination with siRNA against IL11 and IL15 in CAFs severely blunted tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs. Moreover, IL11 and IL15 from breast CAFs can activate STAT3 in HUVECs. This is in line with the previous findings by Tao and Angiolillo. These findings suggest a complicated VEGF-dependent and VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast stromal CAFs.Our findings support that VEGF-independent angiogenesis is pivotal to clinical tumor therapy. Tumor resistance to anti-VEGF therapy and sustained tumor angiogenesis might occur in a VEGF-independent manner. Excluding tumor cells themselves, various stromal cells contribute to resistance to anti-VEGF signaling, ultimately promoting tumor progression. For example, CD11b+Gr1+ cells, initiated by G-CSF, mediate tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF therapy. CAFs have been confirmed to be involved in resistance to anti-VEGF treatment. For example, TAFs isolated from invasive breast cancer secrete SDF-1 to recruit hematopoietic cells, or anti-VEGFA refractory subcutaneous tumor produces abundant PDGF-C to maintain tumor angiogenesis. Here, we prove that IL11 and IL15 are novel pro-angiogenic factors in breast CAF. Particularly, the angiogenic factors IL11 and IL15 derived from CAFs are regulated by miR-205/YAP1, which is not affected by the different types of control vectors, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis of fibroblasts during preparation of CM. Thus, miR-205/YAP1/IL11/IL15 signaling axis, a VEGF-independent signaling in breast stromal CAFs, plays a specific role to tumor angiogenesis. However, the combined targeting YAP1 and VEGF did not completely block angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo, suggesting additional mechanisms involved in VEGF-independent angiogenesis.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that activated CAFs promote VEGF-independent proangiogenic processes in the breast tumor microenvironment. Secretion of IL11 and IL15 governed by miR-205/YAP1 signaling in CAFs specifically stimulates STAT3 signaling in vascular endothelial cells, contributing to tumor angiogenesis and resistance to anti-VEGF, thus triggering tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer.Supplementary MaterialAbbreviationsCAFcancer associated-fibroblastmiR-205micoRNA-205YAP1Yes-associated protein 1VEGFvascular endothelial growth factor AIL11interleukin 11IL15interleukin 15NFnormal fibroblastHUVECsHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial CellsSTAT3signal transducer and activator of transcription 3VEGFRvascular endothelial growth factor receptorFDAFood and Drug AdministrationDLL4delta like canonical Notch ligand 4NRP1neuropilin 1ABL1ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinaseFGFfibroblast growth factorPDGFplatelet derived growth factorTAMsTumor-associated macrophagesTGFtransforming growth factorSDF1stromal cell-derived factor 1G-CSFcolony stimulating factor 3ECMExtracellular matrixCSCscancer stem cellsMFAP5microfibril associated protein 5Hhour\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinFAPfibroblast activation proteinCK8+18cytokeratin 8 and cytokeratin 18CD31Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)LVlentivirusshRNAshort hairpin RNAsiRNAsmall interfering RNAMVDmicrovessel densityIHCimmunohistochemistryIFimmunofluorescenceFNfibronectinFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateqRT-PCRquantitative real-time polymerase chain reactionCMconditioned mediumELISAenzyme-linked immuno sorbent assayTCGAThe Cancer Genome AtlasDCIScarcinoma in situIDCinvasive ductal carcinomaHNRNPKheterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein KSLC4A4solute carrier family 4 member 4CtrlcontrolCMCcarboxymethylcelluloseSalsaline.Role of angiogenesis in human tumor dormancy: animal models of the angiogenic switchMigration and proliferation of endothelial cells in preformed and newly formed blood vessels during tumor angiogenesisVEGF and the quest for tumour angiogenesis factorsImaging key biomarkers of tumor angiogenesisVEGFA and tumour angiogenesisRecent molecular discoveries in angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapies in cancerLimited Tumor Tissue Drug Penetration Contributes to Primary Resistance against Angiogenesis InhibitorsIn the end what matters most?

IntroductionBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed tumor and represents the second leading cause of cancer death among females worldwide. To date, it has been identified different subgroups of breast cancers with peculiar prognosis and response to chemotherapeutics. For instance, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is associated with a high risk of recurrence and poor prognosis. Currently, the key limiting factor in the treatment of TNBC is the lack of tailored therapeutic strategies. Hence, in the last years, great efforts have been made toward the identification of signaling pathways contributing to the TNBC progression. In this regard, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/FGF receptor (FGFR) axis has been indicated as a potential candidate for targeted therapy. FGFRs are receptor tyrosine kinases which encompass four key members (FGFR1 to FGFR4) and one receptor that binds to FGF ligands, although it lacks the intracellular kinase domain (FGFR5, also named FGFRL1). FGFRs are involved in diverse pathophysiological conditions and cell responses such as survival, growth, motility, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. It is worth mentioning that TNBC cells may show genomic FGFR alterations along with an altered FGF2 signaling loop, suggesting that FGFR inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies could be considered in comprehensive therapeutic approaches aimed to halt TNBC progression.Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment mainly contributes to cancer development and metastatic dissemination. For instance, diverse components of the tumor stroma may influence the spread of tumor cells, providing certain signals that trigger invasive phenotypes. In this regard, the S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) that belongs to the S100 family proteins has been shown to contribute to the functional liaison between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment toward worse outcomes. Corroborating these findings, an increased level of S100A4 has been detected in breast cancer interstitial fluid and in the serum of S100A4 transgenic mice. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that S100A4 secreted by either tumor and/or stromal cells may lead to pro-metastatic events such as cell motility, invasion, and angiogenesis. Indeed, extracellular S100A4, acting in a paracrine manner, stimulates biological responses through the interaction with the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE, which is a multi-ligand transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, may be involved in several clinical disorders, including cancer. Furthermore, RAGE activation may induce proliferative, angiogenic, migratory, and inflammatory effects associated with a poor prognosis in several tumors such as breast cancer.Here, performing a bioinformatics analysis on the publicly available TCGA dataset, we have ascertained that FGF2 expression is positively correlated with S100A4 in a large cohort of TNBC patients. Moreover, we have assessed the molecular mechanisms through which the FGF2/FGFR1 axis triggers S100A4 expression and secretion, leading to important biological responses that may contribute to TNBC progression.2. Results2.1. The Gene Expression Levels of FGF2 and S100A4 Are Correlated in TNBC PatientsPrevious studies have shown that diverse stimuli, including growth factors, regulate S100A4 expression in cancer cells toward aggressive tumor features. As it concerns TNBC, the overexpression of S100A4 has been reported to promote cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. Furthermore, several reports have also highlighted a significant correlation between the expression of S100A4 and advanced tumor stage, the presence of distant metastases, and worse survival rates in breast cancer patients. On the basis of these findings, we began our investigation by querying \u201cThe Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas\u201d (TCGA) dataset, which supplies RNA-Seq data and clinical information of breast cancer patients. Of note, the FGF2 and S100A4 gene expression levels were found to be higher in TNBC with respect to non-TNBC patients (Figure 1a,b). In addition, a positive correlation between FGF2 and S100A4 levels was assessed in TNBC samples (Figure 1c), suggesting their potential cooperation in this aggressive breast cancer subtype.2.2. FGF2/FGFR1 Mediated Signaling Upregulates S100A4 Levels in TNBC CellsThen, we aimed to evaluate whether FGF2 may regulate S100A4 levels in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells that were used as a model system of TNBC. Of note, FGF2 induced the expression of S100A4 at both mRNA (Figure 2a,b) and protein levels in TNBC cells (Figure 2c,d). However, the S100A4 protein expression upon FGF2 exposure was no longer evident using the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 (Figure 2e,f) and in FGFR1 knockout (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Figure 2g,h and Supplementary Figure S1a,b), which were obtained by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Next, the secretion of S100A4 upon treatment with FGF2 was evaluated in conditioned medium collected from FGFR1 (WT) and FGFR1 (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells. S100A4 levels were found upregulated by FGF2 in conditioned medium derived from FGFR1 (WT) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, but not in conditioned medium derived from FGFR1 (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells treated with FGF2 (Figure 2i,j). Considering that FGFR1 activation by FGF2 triggers certain transduction pathways, we assessed that the upregulation of S100A4 induced by FGF2 is prevented using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (WM) (Figure 2k,l), but not in the presence of the STAT3 inhibitor STA21 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (SP) (data not shown).In support of these findings, the treatment with FGF2 induced the phosphorylation of FGFR1 as well as the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Supplementary Figure S2a,b). Moreover, we ascertained that in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT upon FGF2 treatment is prevented in the presence of the specific inhibitors PD98059 and Wortmannin (WM), respectively (Supplementary Figure S2c,d). Next, the transcriptional activation of the S100A4 promoter construct prompted by FGF2 in FGFR1 (WT) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells was no longer evident in FGFR1 (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Figure 3a,b) or using the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074, the MEK inhibitor PD98059, and the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (WM) in FGFR1 (WT) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Figure 3c,d). Taken together, these findings indicate that FGF2 induces S100A4 expression through the activation of the FGFR1\u2013ERK1/2\u2013AKT transduction pathway in TNBC cells.2.3. c-Rel Is Involved in the Upregulation of S100A4 Induced by FGF2/FGFR1 SignalingIt has been reported that FGFR1 activation triggers the NF-kB signaling cascade in diverse cell contexts, including breast tumor cells. The NF-kB subunit named c-Rel was indicated to be a transcription factor involved in NF-kB signaling in breast cancer. In order to investigate whether c-Rel may be engaged in the upregulation of S100A4 prompted by the FGF2/FGFR1 axis, we ascertained that the exposure to FGF2 induces the nuclear shuttle of c-Rel in FGFR1 (WT) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells but not in FGFR1 (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence (Figure 4a,b and Figure 5a,b) and subcellular fractionation studies (Figure 4c and Figure 5c).Through immunofluorescence assays performed in MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Figure S3a,b) and SUM159 (Supplementary Figure S4a,b) cells, we also determined that c-Rel nuclear translocation upon FGF2 exposure is abrogated in the presence of the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 or the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (WM). However, whole c-Rel protein levels were not altered upon treatment with FGF2 in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Supplementary Figure S5a\u2013d). Thereafter, we assessed that FGF2 treatment induces the recruitment of c-Rel to the NF-kB site located within the S100A4 promoter sequence in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (Figure 6a\u2013c). Further supporting these results, the treatment with FGF2 did not induce transactivation of the S100A4 promoter construct, lacking the NF-kB binding site in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Figure 6d). Remarkably, the silencing of c-Rel abolished the transcriptional activation of the S100A4 promoter construct upon FGF2 in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Figure 6e\u2013h). In accordance with these findings, the S100A4 protein induction (Figure 6i,j) and secretion (Figure 6k,l) triggered by FGF2 prevented silencing c-Rel in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells. Collectively, these results suggest that activation of the FGFR1\u2013ERK1/2\u2013AKT\u2013c-Rel signaling pathway mediates the upregulation of S100A4 levels in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells.2.4. The Paracrine Activation of S100A4/RAGE Signaling Induces Endothelial Tube Formation in HUVECsS100A4 released by tumor and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment may contribute to cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In this regard, previous studies have demonstrated that several S100 family members, including S100A4, act in both an autocrine and paracrine manner mainly binding to and activating RAGE-mediated signaling in different cell types. On the basis of these observations, we aimed to evaluate the paracrine effects of S100A4 derived from FGF2-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells on vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Hence, conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells exposed to FGF2 was collected and used as culture medium in HUVECs in order to perform tube formation assay. Upon this experimental condition, HUVECs showed a complex and ramified network of tubules (Figure 7a,d), while no tube formation was observed using conditioned medium from FGFR1 (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells exposed to FGF2 (Figure 7b,e) or in the presence of the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 (data not shown).Similar effects were obtained culturing HUVECs in conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells silenced for c-Rel expression and treated with FGF2 (Figure 7g\u2013l). Further corroborating these findings, conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells exposed to FGF2 and immunodepleted for S100A4 (Supplementary Figure S6a,b) reduced the endothelial tube formation of HUVECs as also observed in the presence of the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (Figure 8). Altogether, these results suggest that the release of S100A4 from FGF2-stimulated MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells promotes the paracrine activation of RAGE signaling toward angiogenic responses.2.5. S100A4/RAGE Paracrine Activation Promotes Cell Migration in Breast Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs)In order to further evaluate the paracrine action exerted by S100A4, we sought to determine whether S100A4 may trigger biological effects on main components of tumor microenvironment as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Remarkably, CAFs cultured in conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells exposed to FGF2 exhibited an increased migratory capacity (Figure 9a,c) that was absent using the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074 (data not shown) or when culturing CAFs in conditioned medium from FGFR1 (KO) MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells treated with FGF2 (Figure 9b,d).Similarly, we did not observe the migration of CAFs cultured with conditioned medium from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells silenced for c-Rel expression and treated with FGF2 (Figure 10).In addition, the migration of CAFs cultured in conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells exposed to FGF2, was prevented immunodepleting S100A4 and using the RAGE inhibitor FPS-ZM1 (Figure 11). Altogether, these results show that the S100A4 release by FGF2-stimulated TNBC cells may elicit a paracrine action via RAGE toward the migration of CAFs.3. DiscussionIn the present study, we have provided novel findings regarding the role of the FGF2/FGFR1 transduction pathway on the regulation of S100A4 in TNBC cells. Querying the public TCGA dataset, we first ascertained that the expression of S100A4 is higher in TNBC with respect to non-TNBC patients and correlated with the levels of FGF2 in TNBC samples. Then, we demonstrated that FGF2 induces the upregulation and release of S100A4 through the FGFR1\u2013ERK1/2\u2013AKT\u2013c-Rel transduction pathway in TNBC cells. Focusing on the functional liaison occurring between breast tumor cells and components of the surrounding stroma, we next assessed that S100A4 secreted by TNBC cells upon FGF2 treatment via RAGE endothelial tube formation and migratory responses in CAFs. Hence, our data extend the current knowledge on the transduction network activated by the FGF2/FGFR1 axis toward TNBC aggressiveness.Great efforts have been recently addressed to better understand the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer progression and the failure of antitumor therapies. The TME is characterized by a multifaceted interplay occurring between the epithelial cancer cells and the neighboring non-cancerous stromal compartment that encompasses various cell types, including CAFs, endothelial, immune cells, and adipocytes. In this context, it has been demonstrated that the release by either cancer cells or components of tumor stroma of various effectors such as growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and others may promote the acquisition of aggressive and metastatic phenotypes. For instance, it has been suggested that FGF2 may act as an important tumor-promoting factor, in accordance with data showing that its levels are elevated in TNBC cells and in plasma samples of TNBC and other types of tumors. In addition, the upregulation and secretion of FGF2 have been shown to stimulate, in an autocrine and paracrine manner, the FGFR-mediated signaling toward cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis.Despite the efforts made in recent years, metastatic evolution remains the primary cause of death in breast cancer patients. Therefore, the identification of metastatic markers is a challenge for better monitoring aggressive tumor features in order to improve the survival rates of patients. In this regard, S100A4 (also known as metastasin or metastasis-associated protein) may be included among the predictive molecular biomarkers of cancer progression. The S100A4 gene was originally isolated and characterized from metastatic cells and then associated to tumor metastasis. In normal tissue, S100A4 was predominantly detected in the nervous system and connected to the neuronal plasticity in pathophysiological conditions. S100A4 expression is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms and a complex signal transduction network. Moreover, the expression of S100A4 can be boosted by diverse stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and hypoxia in diverse types of cancers. In this vein, our results have shown that FGF2 is involved in the regulation of S100A4 in TNBC cells. In particular, we have determined that the FGF2/FGFR1 axis induces the transcriptional activation of S100A4 in a NF-kB-dependent manner in TNBC cells. NF-kB is a protein complex that encompasses a family of Rel-like domain dimeric transcription factors exhibiting both shared and distinct biological functions. Upon its shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, NF-kB interacts with specific DNA binding regions leading to the transcription of various genes. Of note, we found that FGF2 induces the nuclear accumulation of c-Rel and its recruitment within the S100A4 promoter region toward the upregulation of S100A4 expression and secretion. These findings add novel insights to previous studies suggesting that S100A4 plays a role in the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and in the pre-metastatic niche formation and is correlated with high tumor grade and poor survival of cancer patients.The S100A4 protein, as a typical member of the S100 family, exerts both intracellular and extracellular activities. Intracellularly, S100A4 binds to several protein targets involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamic, cell adhesion, and the apoptotic process. As extracellular protein released by both tumor or stroma cells, S100A4 acts in either an autocrine or paracrine manner by binding to its cognate receptor RAGE, thereby triggering cell migration, invasion, and angiogenic responses. Notably, in accordance with these observations, we assessed that the inhibition of RAGE abrogates the paracrine action elicited by S100A4 toward angiogenesis and the migration of CAFs.Collectively, our results indicate that S100A4 may be considered as a novel target of FGF2/FGFR1 transduction pathway in TNBC cells. Although further studies are warranted to deeply elucidate the peculiar oncogenic action of S100A4/RAGE, our findings may pave the way for more comprehensive therapeutic strategies aiming to halt TNBC aggressiveness.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Bioinformatics AnalysesIn silico gene expression analyses were performed on R Studio (version 3.6.1) using the publicly available information of the Invasive Breast Cancer Cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The clinical information and mRNA expression data (RNA Seq V2 RSEM) of patients were retrieved from UCSC Xena () on the 1st December 2020. The breast cancer samples of the TCGA cohort (n. 1247) were filtered by \u201csample type\u201d in order to exclusively obtain the information of primary tumor tissues (n. 1104). Thereafter, patients were classified on the basis of the presence or absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Gene expression and clinical information were also filtered for missing values, obtaining 650 non-TNBC and 123 TNBC patients. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r-value) was calculated using the R cor.test() function and setting the method as \u201cPearson\u201d, and the statistical analysis was performed using the t-test. Box plots and scatter plots were performed with the R tidyverse package.4.2. ReagentsWe purchased PD173074 from Selleckchem (DBA, Milan, Italy), PD98059 from Calbiochem (DBA, Milan, Italy), Wortmannin (WM) and FPS-ZM1 from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) 100-18B from PEPROTECH (SIAL, Rome, Italy). All the aforementioned compounds were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) except for FGF2, which was dissolved in aqueous buffer (0.1% BSA).4.3. Cell CulturesThe TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The TNBC SUM159 cells were kindly provided by Dr. W.T. Khaled, University of Cambridge, UK. MDA-MB 231 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) with phenol red, supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while SUM159 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium) with phenol red and supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/mL of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), 1 \u03bcg/mL of hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), kindly provided by Dr. Caruso, University of Brescia, Italy, were seeded on collagen-coated flasks (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and cultured in endothelial growth medium (EGM) (Lonza, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 5% FBS (Lonza, Milan, Italy). Cells were used less than 6 months after resuscitation and mycoplasma negativity was tested monthly. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated, cultured, and characterized as previously described from 10 invasive mammary ductal carcinomas and pooled for the subsequent studies. Briefly, specimens were cut into small pieces (1\u20132 mm diameter), placed in digestion solution (400 IU collagenase, 100 IU hyaluronidase and 10% FBS, containing antibiotics and antimycotics solution), and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were then separated by differential centrifugation at 90\u00d7 g for 2 min. The supernatant containing fibroblasts were centrifuged at 485\u00d7 g for 8 min, the obtained pellet was suspended in fibroblasts growth medium (Medium 199 and Ham\u2019s F12 mixed 1:1 and supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy) and cultured at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. CAFs were then expanded onto two 15 cm Petri dishes and stored as cells passaged for two to three population doublings within a total 7 to 10 days after tissue dissociation. Primary cell cultures of breast fibroblasts were characterized by immunofluorescence. In particular, cells were incubated with human anti-vimentin (V9, sc-6260) and human anti-cytokeratin 14 (LL001 sc-53,253), obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA, Milan, Italy) (data not shown). To characterize fibroblast activation, we used anti-fibroblast-activated protein \u03b1 (FAP\u03b1) antibody (H-56; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy) (data not shown). All cell lines were grown in a 37 \u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were switched to medium without serum and phenol red 24 h before treatments to be processed for immunoblot and real-time PCR assays.4.4. Gene Expression StudiesTotal RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription as previously described. The expression of selected genes was analyzed by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and sequences are as follows: 5\u2032-GCAAAGAGGGTGACAAGTTC-3\u2032 (S100A4 Fwd), 5\u2032-TCTGGGAAGCCTTCAAAGAAT-3\u2032 (S100A4 Rev), and 5\u2032-AAGCCACCCCACTTCTCTCTAA-3\u2032 (ACTB Fwd) and 5\u2032-CACCTCCCCTGTGTGGACTT-3\u2032 (ACTB Rev). Assays were performed in triplicate, and the results were normalized with control mRNA levels of actin beta (ACTB) and relative mRNA levels were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method, comparing to the control group.4.5. Gene Silencing Experiments and Luciferase AssaysCells were plated onto 10 cm dishes and transfected using Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy) with a control vector (shRNA) and a specific shRNA sequence for c-Rel. c-Rel shRNA sequence (shc-Rel) was obtained from TRC consortium (TRCN0000039986) and cloned, as previously described, in the piggyBac transposon vector (PB-H1-shRNA-GFP), which was kindly provided by Dr. W.T. Khaled, University of Cambridge, UK. Two days after transfection, cells were selected in a medium containing G418 (200 \u03bcg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) for 5 days, and the G418-resistant colonies were picked and expanded in regular medium. Then, immunoblots for c-Rel protein were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the c-Rel silencing. The S100A4 promoter luciferase constructs pGl4.10 S100A4 (\u2212632/+1010) and the mutant pGl4.10 S100A4 (+58/+1010) were a kind gift from Prof. K. L. O\u2019Connor, Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY (USA). The Renilla luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega, Milan, Italy) was used as internal transfection control. Cells (1 \u00d7 105) were plated into 24-well dishes with 500 \u00b5L/well culture medium containing 5% FBS. Cell medium was replaced on the day of transfection with serum-free medium, and transfection was performed using X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics, Merck Life Science) with a mixture containing 0.5 \u00b5g of each reporter plasmid and 5 ng of pRL-TK. After 8 h, cells were treated with FGF2 alone and in combination with the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074, the MEK inhibitor PD98059, or PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin and incubated for 18 h. Luciferase activity was then measured using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the internal transfection control provided by the Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle (-) were set as 1-fold induction upon which the activity induced by treatments was calculated.4.6. CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated FGFR1 KnockoutThe MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 FGFR1 knockout (KO) cells were generated and characterized as previously described. Briefly, short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence targeting human FGFR1 was designed using the E-CRISP sgRNA Designer (, accessed on 23 October 2017) and cloned into the pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) vector (a kind gift from Dr. W.T. Khaled, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) according to the protocol described in Ran et al.. The FGFR1 sgRNA sequence is as follows: 5\u2032-CGGCCTAGCGGTGCAGAGTG-3\u2019 (sgFGFR1). Then, the plasmid with sgRNA was transiently transfected into MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells using Lipofectamine LTX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). Two days after transfection, the cells were selected in a medium containing 1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). After puromycin selection, the puromycin-resistant colonies were picked and expanded in regular growth medium. Then, immunoblots for FGFR1 protein were performed to evaluate the efficiency of FGFR1 KO.4.7. Western Blot AnalysisCells were processed to obtain protein lysates for Western blot analysis as previously described. Primary antibodies were S100A4 (1C4) (Novus, DBA, Milan, Italy), FGFR1 (#9740), p-FGFR1 (#3476), p-AKT (Ser473) (D9E), and c-Rel (#4727) (Cell Signaling Technology, Euroclone Milan, Italy); p-ERK1/2 (E-4), ERK2 (C-14), AKT/1/2/3 (H-136) and \u03b2-actin (AC-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). Proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Biorad, Milan, Italy) and signals revealed using the chemiluminescent substrate for Western blotting Westar Nova 2.0 (Cyanagen, Biogenerica, Catania, Italy). For nuclear extracts, cells were lysed using 300 \u03bcL of cytosolic buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (1.7 mg/mL aprotinin, 1 mg/mL leupeptin, 200 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate and 100 mmol/liter sodium fluoride). Following centrifugation (14,000\u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), the supernatant was referred to as cytosolic fraction, and the pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in high salt buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 25% [v:v] glycerol, 420 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, and protease inhibitors). For the extraction of nuclear proteins, the obtained solution was vortexed thoroughly, incubated overnight with agitation, and centrifuged at 14,000\u00d7 g, 4 \u00b0C, for 10 min. Equal amounts of the collected supernatants, which represent the previously extracted nuclear fraction and cytosolic fraction, were then electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and Western blot analysis was performed as described above. The purity of fractions was demonstrated immunoblotting with analysis of the cytosolic and nuclear marker proteins \u03b2-actin (AC-15) and lamin B1 (B-10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy), respectively.4.8. Immunofluorescence MicroscopyCultured cells grown to 50% confluency on coverslips were serum-deprived for 24 h and then treated for 2 h with FGF2 alone and in combination with the FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074, the MEK inhibitor PD98059, or PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin, as indicated. Thereafter, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed 3 times with PBS and incubated overnight with a rabbit primary antibody against c-Rel (#4727) (Cell Signaling, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the slides were extensively washed with PBS, probed with Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Then, the slides were imaged on the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode reader (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy) and analyzed using the software Gen5 (BioTek, AHSI, Milan Italy).4.9. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) AssayCells grown in 10 cm plates were shifted for 24 h to medium lacking serum, then treated with vehicle and FGF2 for 2 h, and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated. Supernatants were immuno-cleared with salmon DNA/protein A-agarose (Merck Life Science, Darmstadt, Germany) and immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Rel antibody or nonspecific IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). Pellets were washed, eluted with a buffer comprising 1% SDS and 0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, and digested with proteinase K. DNA was obtained by phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The yield of target region DNA in each sample after ChIP was analyzed by real-time PCR using platform Quant Studio7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). The primers used to amplify a region containing an NF-kB site located into the S100A4 promoter sequence were: 5\u2032-GCAAATGTTCACTGCCCAGA-3\u2032 (Fwd) and 5\u2032-ATCACATCCAGGGCCTTCTC-3\u2032 (Rev). Real-time PCR data were normalized with respect to unprocessed lysates (Input) and the results were reported as fold changes with respect to nonspecific IgG.4.10. Conditioned MediumMDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were cultured in regular growth medium, then washed twice with PBS and switched to medium without serum for 24 h. Next, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were treated for 6 h with FGF2, as indicated. Culture medium was then removed, then cells were washed twice with PBS in order to eliminate any FGF2 residue and cultured for additional 8 h with fresh serum-free medium. Thereafter, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min to remove cell debris, and used as conditioned medium in the appropriate experiments.4.11. Acetone Precipitation of ProteinsProtein precipitation from conditioned medium derived from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells was carried out using the precipitation method with acetone. Briefly, four volumes of ice-cold acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) were added to one volume of sample. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at \u201320 \u00b0C overnight. This was followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. Afterwards, the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was air dried, then it was dissolved in 2\u00d7 Laemmli buffer and used in the appropriate experiments. In Western blot analysis, the protein loading of conditioned medium samples was checked by Ponceau red staining (0.1% Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid) of the blotted membranes.4.12. S100A4-Immunodepleted Conditioned MediumTo deplete S100A4, conditioned medium was collected from MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells that were treated as indicated and cleared of cells by centrifugation. Thereafter, according to the previously reported protein immunodepletion protocol, protein A/G-agarose beads were incubated with anti-S100A4 or IgG antibodies for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. Then, antibody\u2013bead complexes were incubated with MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cell-derived conditioned medium overnight and centrifuged. S100A4 immunodepletion was verified by immunoblotting and the S100A4-immunodepleted medium was used in endothelial tube formation and scratch assays, as indicated.4.13. Tube Formation AssayThe day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs were starved overnight at 37 \u00b0C in serum-free medium. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel\u00ae (Cultrex, Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was thawed overnight at 4 \u00b0C on ice, plated on the bottom of pre-chilled 96-well plates, and left at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h for gelification. Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment (0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), counted, and resuspended in conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 or SUM159 cells treated as indicated. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on Matrigel and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Tube formation was observed starting from 6 h after cell seeding and quantified using WCIF ImageJ software.4.14. Scratch AssayCAFs were seeded into 12-well plates and were allowed to grow in regular growth medium until they were 70\u201380% confluent. Next, cells were switched in medium without serum, and after 24 h, a p200 pipette tip was used to create a scratch of the cell monolayer. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C with conditioned medium collected from MDA-MB-231 or SUM159 cells for 24 h, as indicated. Pictures were photographed at 0 and 24 h after scratching using inverted phase contrast microscope (5\u00d7 magnification). The rate of cell migration was measured by quantifying the % of wound closure area, determined using the software WCIF ImageJ, according to the following formula:4.15.

According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO), there were estimated 2.2 million new lung cancer cases and 1.8 million deaths in 2020. The major subtype of lung cancer is NSCLC which accounts for 85% of total lung cancer. Almost 90% of lung cancer patients die of invasiveness and metastasis, results in the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer is only 15%. Therefore, the investigation on the key regulators of metastasis is critical for the improvement of lung cancer treatment.Emerging evidence reveals that TME plays pivotal roles in tumor initiation and development via regulating immune escape, inflammation, angiogenesis and therapy response. The composition of TME is complex, including tumor cells, stromal cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), blood vessels and lymph-vessels. CAFs are one of the major stromal cells in TME. CAFs support and promote tumor progression via secreting cytokines and growth factors. CAFs-derived transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) induced EMT and promoted aggressive phenotypes in breast cancer. CAFs upregulated CXCR4, \u03b2-catenin, PPAR\u03b4, and enhanced invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma by secretion of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1). reported that human colorectal cancer-derived CAFs stimulated adhesion of colorectal cancer cells to endothelial cells via releasing hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Our previous studies also showed that CAFs facilitate metastasis and chemoresistance of lung cancer cells through IL-6 and ANXA3 secretion. Despite many studies are focused on the promoting effect of CAFs-derived cytokines on cancer cells, the upstream regulators of cytokine release in CAFs is largely unknown.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA with 20\u201322 nucleotides. MiRNAs bind to 3\u2032-UTR of target mRNAs through complementary base-pairing, and negatively regulate target genes at transcription level via perfect complementarity or at translation level via imperfect complementarity. MiRNAs play important roles in various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and survival. In particular, miRNAs are also involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. MiR-153-5p promotes the proliferation and metastasis via targeting AGO1 in renal cell carcinoma, our previous study demonstrated that miR-26a enhances invasiveness of human lung cancer cells by suppressing GSK3\u03b2. On the contrary, miRNAs may also inhibit metastasis. MiRNA-32-5p inhibits EMT and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma by targeting SMAD3, miR-16-1-3p suppresses breast cancer growth and metastasis by inhibiting Warburg Effect.Given the roles of CAFs in tumor progression and metastasis, we in the present study, explored the role of miRNA in CAFs\u2019 promoting effect. We found that miR-101-3p was downregulated in lung cancer-associated CAFs. We further demonstrated that downregulation of miR-101-3p in CAFs increased VEGFA secretion, facilitating the metastasis potential of lung cancer cells via activation of Akt/eNOS signaling pathway.Materials and MethodsReagents and AntibodiesThe miR-101-3p mimics, inhibitor and control were obtained from Genepharma (Shanghai, China). Human recombinant VEGFA and VEGFA neutralizing antibody were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies against VEGFA, Vimentin, AKT, p-AKT, eNOS, p-eNOS, MMP-9, TWIST1, N-cadherin were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO). The antibody against E-cadherin was purchased from BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA). The antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom).Lung Cancer Cell CultureHuman lung cancer cell lines A549, H1299 and H661 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY). H661 and H1299 cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium (GIBCO). Medium were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). All cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2.Isolation and Culture of Lung Stromal FibroblastsLung cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal lung fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated and cultured, and conditioned medium (CM) were collected after 48\u00a0h according to the method previously described. The tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from the NSCLC patients underwent surgery at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital (TMUGH; Tianjin, China). The informed consents were obtained from patients. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUGH.Cell ProliferationLung cancer cells were plated in a 96-wells plate at a density of 5 \u00d7 103\u00a0cells/well. The cells were cultured with same amount of conditioned medium for 48\u00a0h and the cell viability was determined by the CCK-8 kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan).Cell MigrationWound healing assays were performed to examine the ability of cell migration as previously described. Cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured with same amount of different CM. A plastic pipette tip was used to make a clean wound area across the well when cells grew to 100% confluence. Cells were allowed to migrate in the medium. Pictures were taken by a microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) after 24\u00a0h to estimate the wound closure.Cell InvasionTranswell assay can be a method to examine the cell invasion ability as previously described. Chambers (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) with 8.0\u00a0mm polycarbonate filter inserts were put in 24-well plates and coated with 40\u00a0\u03bcl Matrigel (BD Matrigel and serum-free DMEM were mixed in a ratio of 1:6) (BD Biosciences). 1-6 x 104\u00a0cells suspended in serum-free DMEM medium were added to the upper compartment of the chamber. 700\u00a0\u03bcl CM were added to the lower compartment. After 48\u00a0h co-culture, the invaded cells were stained with 1% crystal violet and counted under a microscope.Quantitative PCRTotal RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen). 2\u00a0\u03bcg RNA was used for reverse transcription by using TaKaRa kit (Dalian, China). For gene expression detection, Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI) was used and qPCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detector System. The primers were designed by Primer Premier 5.0 and synthesized by BGI (Beijing, China). The sequences of the primers were listed in Table 1. The miRNAs Quantitation kit (GenePharma) was used to detect the expression of miR-101-3p, and U6 level was used for normalization.PCR primer sequences.Primers\t\tSequence (5\u20133\u2032)\tLength of amplicons (bp)\t \tTWIST1\tForward\tGCC\u200bAAT\u200bCAG\u200bCCA\u200bCTG\u200bAAA\u200bGG\t83\t \tReverse\tTGT\u200bTCT\u200bTAT\u200bAGT\u200bTCC\u200bTCT\u200bGAT\u200bTGT\u200bTAC\u200bCA\t \tMMP9\tForward\tTGT\u200bACC\u200bGCT\u200bATG\u200bGTT\u200bACA\u200bCTC\u200bG\t97\t \tReverse\tGGC\u200bAGG\u200bGAC\u200bAGT\u200bTGC\u200bTTC\u200bT\t \tN-cadherin\tForward\tAGC\u200bCAA\u200bCCT\u200bTAA\u200bCTG\u200bAGG\u200bAGT\t136\t \tReverse\tGGC\u200bAAG\u200bTTG\u200bATT\u200bGGA\u200bGGG\u200bATG\t \tE-cadherin\tForward\tCGA\u200bGAG\u200bCTA\u200bCAC\u200bGTT\u200bCAC\u200bGG\t119\t \tReverse\tGGG\u200bTGT\u200bCGA\u200bGGG\u200bAAA\u200bAAT\u200bAGG\t \tVimentin\tForward\tAGT\u200bCCA\u200bCTG\u200bAGT\u200bACC\u200bGGA\u200bGAC\t97\t \tReverse\tCAT\u200bTTC\u200bACG\u200bCAT\u200bCTG\u200bGCG\u200bTTC\t \t\u03b1-SMA\tForward\tCACTGCCGCA TCCTCA TC\t161\t \tReverse\tTGC\u200bTGT\u200bTGT\u200bAGG\u200bTGG\u200bTTT\u200bCA T\t \tVEGFA\tForward\tAGG\u200bGCA\u200bGAA\u200bTCA\u200bTCA\u200bCGA\u200bAGT\t75\t \tReverse\tAGG\u200bGTC\u200bTCG\u200bATT\u200bGGA\u200bTGG\u200bCA\t \tGAPDH\tForward\tTGC\u200bACC\u200bACC\u200bAAC\u200bTGC\u200bTTA\u200bGC\t87\t \tReverse\tGGCA TGGACTGTGGTCA TGAG\t \tmiR-101-3p\tForward\tCAT\u200bCGC\u200bACG\u200bTAC\u200bAGT\u200bACT\u200bGTG\u200bATA\t70\t \tReverse\tCTC\u200bTGT\u200bCTC\u200bTCG\u200bTCT\u200bTGT\u200bTGG\u200bTAT\t \tU6\tForward\tCGC\u200bTTC\u200bGGC\u200bAGC\u200bACA\u200bTAT\u200bAC\t87\t \tReverse\tTTC\u200bACG\u200bAAT\u200bTTG\u200bCGT\u200bGTC\u200bATC\t \tMMP9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth factor A; \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Western Blot AnalysisWestern blottings were performed as previously described. Cells were treated with RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) containing protease inhibitor (Sigma- Aldrich) for 30\u00a0min on ice. Cell lysate was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST), then were probed with primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots were visualized with the ECL Western Blotting System (ThermoFisher Scientific).Transfection and Luciferase AssayCAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p mimics, miR-NC, miR-101-3p inhibitor, inhibitor NC using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Briefly, the wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) 3\u2032-UTR of human VEGFA were cloned into pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). 293T cells were plated in 12-well plates and transfected with 100\u00a0nM miRNAs mimics or inhibitor, and 400\u00a0ng wt or mt VEGFA 3\u2032-UTR plasmid, and 40\u00a0ng pRL-SV40 (Invitrogen) as an internal control. Luciferase activity were detected 24\u00a0h after transfection using Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent AssayCAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p mimics, miR-NC, miR-101-3p-inhibitor or inhibitor NC for 24\u00a0h. The supernatants were collected to detect VEGFA using an human VEGFA ELISA Kit (RayBiotech Life, GA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Tumor Xenograft ExperimentTo establish stable cell lines, CAFs were transduced with lentiviruses expressing pre-miR-101-3p or negative control (CAFs/miR-101-3p, CAFs/miR-NC), and selected by puromycin. Female BALB/c nude mice (5-week-old) were obtained from the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and randomly divided into 3 groups including 3 \u00d7 106 A549-luc (expressing luciferase) alone, 3 \u00d7 106 A549-luc cells and 6 \u00d7 106 CAF-miR-NC (ratio 1:2) cells, or 3 \u00d7 106 A549-luc and 6 \u00d7 106 CAF-miR-101-3p cells (ratio 1:2). Cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank of mice. The experiment was conducted for 5\u00a0weeks. Tumor growth was measured by IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen Corporation, Alameda, CA). The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Tianjin Medical University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines.Statistical AnalysisData are presented as the means \u00b1 SEM. The differences between two groups were analyzed by student\u2019s t-test, and the differences among more than two groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Analysis was performed using SPSS21.0. The P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsCAFs Enhanced Migration and Invasion of NSCLC CellsIn order to investigate CAFs\u2019 effect on NSCLC cells, we have performed experiments on NSCLC cell lines A549, H1299 and H661, which represent adenocarcinoma, carcinoma and large cell carcinoma, respectively. CAFs and NFs were isolated and characterized as our previous work. Both CAFs and NFs displayed spindle-like shape, and morphology showed no notable difference between CAFs and NFs (Figure 1A). We then detected the fibroblast markers by Western blotting analysis. Different from A549 cells which are epithelial cells, CAFs and NFs did not express E-cadherin, but expressed vimentin and \u03b1-SMA. Notably, CAFs possessed higher level of \u03b1-SMA than NFs (Figure 1B).CAFs enhanced migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. (A) The morphology of cultured primary NFs and CAFs. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcM (B) The gene expression was detected by Western blots. (C) Lung cancer cells were cultured in NF-CM or CAF-CM. Cell growth was examined by CCK-8 kit after 48\u00a0h. (D,E) Cell invasion was detected by wound healing assay after 24\u00a0h. Scale bar, 200\u00a0\u03bcM (F,G) Cell migration was examined by transwell assay after 48\u00a0h. Scale bar, 100\u00a0\u03bcM (H,I) The gene expressions were detected by Western blots after 48\u00a0h. Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. There were three replicates in each independent experiment. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Next, NF-CM and CAF-CM were collected and cultured lung cancer cells, and cell proliferation was examined by CCK-8 kit. Figure 1C showed that both CAFs and NFs promoted lung cancer cell growth, and CAFs was more effective than NFs. To assess the effect of CAFs on migration and invasion of NSCLC cells, NSCLC cells were treated with NF-CM and CAF-CM, DMEM medium was used as a control, then wound healing assay and transwell assay was performed. The results of wound healing assay showed that the adhesive rates for A549, H1299 and H661 cells were increased to 1.80-, 1.24- and 1.56-fold of control by NFs, respectively. When cultured with CAF-CM, the migration levels were increased to 2.21-, 1.43- and 2.11-fold of control, respectively (Figures 1D,E). Consistent with the migration assay, the transwell assay indicated that both NFs and CAFs stimulated cell invasion, and CAFs were more effective (Figures 1F,G).EMT is a key stage in tumor metastasis process, we further investigated the EMT process when lung cancer cells were treated with NF-CM or CAF-CM. The expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin decreased whereas the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and N-cadherin increased (Figure 1H). Given that metastasis is mediated by metastasis-related genes, we then examined the effect of CAFs on metastasis-related genes MMP9 and Twist1. Figure 1I showed that NF-CM and CAF-CM upregulated the expression of MMP9 and Twist1, and CAFs had stronger effect. Taken together, our data suggested that CAFs enhanced the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells through regulating EMT process and metastasis-related genes.MiR-101-3p was Downregulated in CAFs and Suppressed CAFs ActivationNumerous studies have shown that miR-101-3p is dysregulated in various types of tumors and suppress tumor growth including NSCLC. However, the role of miR-101-3p in CAFs is unclear. We first evaluated the miR-101-3p level in CAFs, and found that miR-101-3p was down-regulated in CAFs compared with NFs in NSCLC (Figure 2A). We then manipulated the miR-101-3p expression in CAFs by transfecting miR-101-3p mimics or inhibitor, and examined its effect on CAFs proliferation. MiR-101-3p had no remarkable effect after 24\u00a0h transfection, however, after 48\u00a0h transfection, miR-101-3p mimics suppressed CAFs growth whereas miR-101-3p inhibitor promoted CAFs growth (Figures 2B,C).MiR-101-3p suppressed CAFs activation. (A) MiR-101-3p expression in NFs and CAFs was detected by qPCR (n = 10). CAFs were transfected with 100\u00a0nM of miR-101-3p mimics or inhibitors. (B) MiR-101-3p expression in CAFs was detected by qPCR. (C) Cell viability was examined by CCK-8 kit. (D) Gene expression was detected by qPCR. (E) Gene expression was detected by Western blots. Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.To determine whether miR-101-3p play a role in CAFs activation, we overexpressed or knocked down miR-101-3p, then detected the expression of CAFs markers including N-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b1-SMA. At transcription level, miR-101-3p repressed mRNA expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b1-SMA expression, respectively. On the contrary, miR-101-3p inhibition enhanced mRNA expression of these genes. In line with this finding, Western blotting results showed that miR-101-3p also affected CAFs markers expression at protein level (Figures 2D,E). Collectively, these data demonstrated that miR-101-3p repressed CAFs activation.MiR-101-3p Mediated the Effect of CAFs on Migration and Invasion of NSCLC CellsGiven that miR-101-3p repressed CAFs activation, this provided rationale for further evaluating the role of miR-101-3p in CAFs\u2019 effect on NSCLC cells. CAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p mimics or inhibitors, and CM was collected and cultured lung cancer cells. Figures 3A,B showed that miR-101-3p inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation whereas miR-101-3p down-regulation stimulated lung cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, we verified the role of miR-101-3p in lung cancer cell invasion. When miR-101-3p was up-regulated in CAFs, the promoting effects of CAFs on lung cancer cell migration and invasion were mitigated significantly, on the contrary, when miR-101-3p was down-regulated in CAFs, the promoting effect of CAFs on lung cancer cell migration and invasion were enhanced (Figures 3C\u2013F). Our results demonstrated that miR-101-3p mediated the effect of CAFs on migration and invasion of NSCLC cells.MiR-101-3p mediated the effect of CAFs on migration and invasion of NSCLC cells (A,B) CAFs were transfected with 100\u00a0nM of miR-101-3p mimics or inhibitor. CM was collected and cultured lung cancer cells. Lung cancer cell viability was examined by CCK-8 kit. (C,D) CAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p mimics. CM was collected and culture lung cancer cells. Cell invasion was detected by wound healing assay, and cell migration was examined by transwell assay. (E,F) CAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p inhibitor. Cell invasion was detected by wound healing assay, and cell migration was examined by transwell assay. (G) MiR-101-3p expression in non-tumor specimens (n = 44) and NSCLC specimens (n = 336) based on TCGA database. (H) OS rate in NSCLC patients divided into high and low/medium expression of miR-101-3p (n = 328) based on TCGA database. Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Furthermore, we investigated the clinical implication of miR-101-3p level in NSCLC patients by using TCGA database. A cohort of 336 NSCLC specimens and 44 non-tumor specimens were analyzed. MiR-101-3p was significantly down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared with non-cancerous tissues (Figure 3G). For Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis, we found that low/medium-expression of miR-101-3p was associated with poor OS rate (Figure 3H, p = 0.0021). These findings suggested that miR-101-3p might serve as a prognostic marker for OS in NSCLC patients.MiR-101-3p in CAFs was Responsible for the Regulation of EMT and AKT/eNOS Signaling Pathway in Lung Cancer CellsSince miR-101-3p played a role in CAFs\u2019 effect on cell invasion, we further explored the underling mechanism. Given that CAFs regulated EMT process and metastasis-related genes in NSCLC cells (Figures 1H,I), we therefore investigated whether miR-101-3p was involved. MiR-101-3p was overexpressed in CAFs and conditioned medium was collected and treated lung cancer cells. qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that E-cadherin was up-regulated whereas vimentin and N-cadherin were down-regulated (Figures 4A,B). Figures 4C,D indicated that metastasis-related genes MMP9 and Twist1 were decreased at both mRNA and protein level. Moreover, we repressed miR-101-3p expression in CAFs by using miR-101-3p inhibitor, as expected, E-cadherin was down-regulated whereas vimentin and N-cadherin were up-regulated, and metastasis-related genes were stimulated (Figure 4E). These results demonstrated that miR-101-3p attenuated CAFs\u2019 effect on EMT process and metastasis-related genes activation in lung cancer cells.MiR-101-3p in CAFs was responsible for the regulation of EMT and AKT/eNOS signaling pathway in lung cancer cells CAFs were transfected with 100\u00a0nM of miR-101-3p mimics. CM was collected and cultured lung cancer cells. The expression of EMT marker genes in lung cancer cells was detected by qPCR (A) and Western blots (B). The expression of metastasis-related genes in lung cancer cells was detected by qPCR (C) and Western blots (D). CAFs were transfected with 100\u00a0nM of miR-101-3p inhibitor. CM was collected and culture lung cancer cells. The expression of genes in lung cancer cells was detected by Western blots (E). CAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p mimics or inhibitor. CM was collected and culture lung cancer cells. The expression of genes in lung cancer cells was detected by Western blots after 48\u00a0h (F,G). Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Cumulative studies have reported that AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in tumor metastasis. We next examined the activation of AKT signaling pathway in this setting. Compared with DMEM, CAF-CM elevated the phosphorylation of AKT and eNOS in lung cancer cells, meanwhile, the total level of AKT and eNOS remained unchanged. However, miR-101-3p diminished CAFs\u2019 effect (Figure 4F). Interestingly, when miR-101-3p was repressed in CAFs, the CAFs\u2019 effect on AKT/eNOS pathway activation was boosted (Figure 4G). Taken together, our data illustrated that miR-101-3p down-regulation in CAFs is responsible for facilitating EMT program and AKT/eNOS pathway activation in lung cancer cells.VEGFA was a Direct Target of miR-101-3pMiRNA executes its function via modulating its target genes. To search for miR-101-3p targets, we applied bioinformatics algorithm including miRTarBase and TargetScan. Among many predicted targets, VEGFA drew our attention because VEGFA is reported to be involved in tumor progression, we therefore selected VEGFA as a candidate target for further investigation.To determine whether VEGFA is a direct target of miR-101-3p, we performed dual-luciferase assay. We first cloned the putative target sequence (wild type, wt) of VEGFA 3\u2032UTR and mutant sequence (mt) into pGL3 luciferase vector (Figure 5A), then transfected these plasmids along with miR-101-3p mimics into 293T cells. The luciferase assay results showed that miR-101-3p mimics significantly reduced the luciferase activities of wt 3\u2032UTR vector, but had no effect on mt 3\u2032UTR vector. In contrast, miR-101-3p inhibitor increased luciferase activities of wt 3\u2032UTR vector (Figure 5B).VEGFA was a direct target of miR-101-3p. (A) Putative miR-101-3p binding sites in 3\u2032-UTR of VEGFA. Nucleotide changes for binding site mutation were indicated. (B) The reporter vectors containing the wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) VEGFA 3\u2032-UTR regions were co-transfected into 293T cells with miR-101-3p, miR-101-3p inhibitor and pRL-SV40 plasmid. The relative luciferase/pRL-SV40 activities were measured 24\u00a0h after transfection. (C,D) CAFs were transfected with miR-101-3p or miR-101-3p inhibitor. The mRNA and protein expression of VEGFA were detected by qPCR and Western blots 24\u00a0h after transfection. (E) The secreted VEGFA were detected by ELISA. Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.To further validate VEGFA as a target of miR-101-3p, we investigated whether VEGFA expression was regulated by miR-101-3p. CAFs were transiently transfected with miR-101-3p mimics or inhibitor, and VEGFA expression was detected by qPCR and Western blot. Figures 5C,D indicated that miR-101-3p suppressed VEGFA expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and miR-101-3p inhibition enhanced VEGFA expression. Since VEGFA was a cytokine, we further examined whether CAFs secreted VEGFA or not by ELISA assay. Our data revealed that CAFs secreted VEGFA into CAF-CM, and miR-101-3p effectively reduced VEGFA secretion by CAFs (Figure 5E). Collectively, these results demonstrated that VEGFA was a direct target of miR-101-3p.VEGFA Mediated the Effect of miR-101-3p on Migration and Invasion of Lung Cancer CellsSince CAFs promote cancer progression via secreting cytokines and growth factors, and our study showed that CAFs secreted VEGFA (Figure 5E), we explored whether VEGFA play a role in CAFs mediated metastasis. We manipulated VEGFA level in CAF-CM by adding 20\u00a0ng/ml of human recombinant VEGFA or 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of VEGFA neutralizing antibody to cell cultures, and determined these effects on cell growth, migration and invasion. Figure 6A showed that recombinant VEGFA boosted CAFs\u2019 effect on cell proliferation, whereas VEGFA neutralizing antibody mitigated CAFs\u2019 effect. Interestingly, when recombinant VEGFA was added to CAF-miR-101-3p-CM, the inhibitory effect of miR-101-3p on cell growth was reversed. We next examined the role of VEGFA in lung cancer cell migration and invasion. Both wound healing assay and transwell assay revealed that VEGFA enhanced CAFs\u2019 effect on cell migration and invasion, and VEGFA reversed the inhibition of miR-101-3p on cell migration and invasion (Figures 6B\u2013E). Moreover, the roles of VEGFA in EMT process and metastasis-related genes of lung cancer cells were also investigated. As expected, VEGFA promoted the enhancement of CAFs on EMT process and metastasis-related genes, and VEGFA attenuated miR-101-3p\u2032s inhibitory effect (Figures 6F,G). Furthermore, Figure 6H showed that VEGFA also affected miR-101-3p\u2032 effect on AKT/eNOS signaling pathway in lung cancer cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that CAFs promoted metastasis potential of lung cancer cell via miR-101-3p regulated VEGFA secretion.VEGFA mediated the effect of miR-101-3p on migration and invasion of lung cancer cells Lung cancer cells were cultured in CAF/miR-NC-CM or CAF/miR-101-3p-CM. 20\u00a0ng/ml of human recombinant VEGFA or 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of VEGFA neutralizing antibody were added. (A) Cell viability was examined by CCK-8 kit. (B,C) Cell migration was detected by wound healing assay. (D,E) Cell invasion was detected by transwell assay. (F) Gene expression was detected by qPCR. (G,H) Gene expression was detected by Western blots. Values represent the mean \u00b1 SD from 3 independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.CAFs Promoted Tumor Growth via Downregulation of miR-101-3p in vivo Since our study showed that CAFs stimulated lung cancer cell growth in vitro, we next evaluated their effect on tumor growth in vivo. Mice were randomly divided into 3 groups consisting of A549-Luc cells alone, A549-Luc cells combined with CAFs-miR-NC, and A549-Luc cells combined with CAFs-miR-101-3p. Cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank of mice. Tumor growth was observed in successive 5\u00a0weeks by IVIS Imaging System. CAFs stimulated tumor growth significantly, the average size of tumors in A549-Luc cells combined with CAFs-miR-NC group was 3.77-fold of A549-Luc cells alone group. Notably, the average size of tumors in A549-Luc cells combined with CAFs-miR-101-3p group was reduced to 1.87-fold of A549-Luc cells alone group, indicating that miR-101-3p mitigated CAFs\u2019 effect (Figures 7A,B).CAFs promoted tumor growth via downregulation of miR-101-3p in vivo 3 \u00d7 106 A549-luc cells alone, or 3 \u00d7 106 A549-luc cells and 6 \u00d7 106 CAF-miR-NC cells, or 3 \u00d7 106 A549-luc and 6 \u00d7 106 CAF-miR-101-3p cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank of mice. (A,B) Tumor growth was measured by IVIS Imaging System at indicated time points. (C) Protein expressions were detected by Western blots. (D) Scheme illustrating the cross-talk between CAFs and lung cancer cells mediated by miR-101-3p/VEGFA/Akt axis. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.Next, we investigated the EMT status and AKT pathway in tumors. The tumor tissues were dissected and related molecules were examined by Western blottings. In line with our findings of in vitro study, CAFs promoted EMT progress, upregulated metastasis-related genes, and activated AKT pathway, meanwhile, miR-101-3p attenuated these effects (Figure 7C). Collectively, our results demonstrated that CAFs facilitated tumor growth through promoting EMT and AKT pathway by downregulation of miR-101-3p.DiscussionTumor progression depends on the communication between TME and tumor cells. CAFs are major components of tumor stroma, hence in the present study, we established the culture of CAFs derived from human lung cancer tissues, and investigated their effects on metastasis potential of lung cancer cells. We found that CAFs enhanced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Further study showed that CAFs induced EMT and stimulated metastasis-related genes in lung cancer cells.Despite many studies are focused on the tumor promoting effect of CAFs-derived cytokines, the upstream regulators of cytokine release in CAFs is largely unknown. MiRNAs regulate the expression of target genes; however, very few studies showed the role of miRNAs in regulating growth factors release from CAFs. reported that in human placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), miR-363 negatively regulated EGR1 in CAFs, leading to the reduction of Angiopoietin-1 secretion which contributed to the angiogenesis of PSTT. Another study showed that miR-101 inhibited the interaction between CAFs and cancer cells via abrogating CXCL12 release from CAFs. We are also interested in miRNA\u2019s role in regulation of growth factor secretion from CAFs. compared the miRNA expression profile between CAFs and NFs in lung cancer. Among differentially expressed miRNAs, downregulated miR-101-3p drew our attention, since several studies revealed that miR-101-3p is involved in metastasis. MiR-101-3p induced M1 to M2 macrophage-type conversion and enhanced cell migration of breast and ovarian. MiR-101-3p promoted hepatocellular carcinoma carcinogenesis by targeting glycogen phosphorylase B. reported that miR-101-3p targeted TRIM44 to inhibit EMT and suppress glioblastoma cell proliferation metastasis. While these functional studies of miR-101-3p were focused on the role of miR-101-3p in cancer cells, we investigated the role of miR-101-3p in CAFs. Our results showed that miR-101-3p was downregulated in CAFs compared to NFs. Ectopic overexpression of miR-101-3p suppressed CAFs activation, and abrogated the promoting effect of CAFs on migration and invasion of NSCLC cells.MiRNAs exert their function by negatively regulating their target genes. There are several miR-101-3p target genes have been reported, which are involved in different biological processes. MiR-101-3p promotes apoptosis of oral cancer cells by targeting BICC1, induces dysfunction of vascular endothelial cell by targeting tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2, suppresses proliferation and metastasis of glioblastoma cells via targeting TRIM44. In the present study, for the first time, we identified VEGFA as a novel target of miR-101-3p. Angiogenesis has essential roles in tumor invasion and progression. VEGFA is one of the key regulators of angiogenesis, it is responsible for many angiogenesis-related diseases including cancer, it also mediates the effect of miRNAs in cancer. MiR-205-5p is downregulated in gastric cancer tissues, it suppresses proliferation and angiogenesis in gastric cancer by reducing the expression of VEGFA and FGF1. MiR-125a-5p inhibits colorectal cancer growth and invasion, VEGFA is a direct target of miR-125a-5p and could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-125a-5p. reported that miR-16-5p overexpression attenuates tumor growth and reduced VEGFA expressions in breast cancer cells. Here we demonstrated that miR-101-3p inhibited VEGFA secretion from CAFs, and VEGFA mediated the effect of CAFs on migration and invasion of lung cancer cells.EMT is a critical step for tumor metastasis. During EMT process the loss of epithelial phenotypes and gain of mesenchymal phenotype facilitate invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Several studies also indicate that CAFs promote EMT transition in cancer cells. CAFs induce EMT and inhibits apoptosis to promote Hepatocellular Carcinoma Progression. reported that CAFs induces EMT and enhances gastric cancer migration and migration via the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis. In lung cancer, CAFs-derived SDF-1 induces EMT via CXCR4/\u03b2-catenin/PPAR\u03b4 signaling. Our results revealed that miR-101-3p is responsible for CAFs\u2019 promoting effect on EMT process in lung cancer cells.Metastasis-related genes play important role in tumor metastasis; we thus examined the effect of CAFs on metastasis-related genes MMP9 and twist1 in lung cancer cells. MMP9 is a member of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, which degrades the components of extracellular matrix to promote cancer cell invasion and metastasis. CAFs can increase MMP9 expression and enhance growth and metastasis of melanoma. This pro-tumoral activity is dependent on CD38 activation in CAFs. reported that estrogen stimulates CAFs to secret IL-6, which regulates MMP9 expression, and promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion. study showed that CAFs promoted migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells through SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 mediated MMP9 secretion. Twist1 is an EMT-regulating transcription factor, it plays key role in metastasis. Only limited studies showed that CAFs modulated Twist1 in cancer cells. CAFs released CXCL12 activates AKT and regulates Twist1 to promote EMT in esophageal cancer cells. In MET-unamplified gastric cancer cells, CAFs-derived HGF activates HGF/STAT3/Twist1 pathway to enhance cell migration and invasion. In this study, we found that downregulation of miR-101-3p in CAFs upregulated the expression of MMP9 and Twist1 in lung cancer cells.We further explore the signaling pathway involved in CAFs\u2019 promoting effect on invasion of lung cancer cells. Nitric Oxide (NO) regulates many biological functions. NO is produced by three different NO synthase (NOS) enzymes, including neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS) and eNOS. Recent studies indicate that AKT/eNOS pathway is responsible for tumorigenesis and cancer development. Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it promotes HCC progression through modulating AKT pathway and eNOS levels. The suppressor of MEK null (sMEK1) protein is an anti-angiogenic factor. sMEK1 inhibits ovarian cancer cell growth and migration via suppressing VEGFR-2-mediated Akt/eNOS/HIF-1\u03b1 pathway. reported that PARP inhibitor Veliparib enhanced curcumin\u2019s inhibitory effect on oral cancer. Mechanistic study showed that curcumin-Veliparib combination suppresses angiogenesis through attenuating PI3K/AKT/eNOS signaling pathway. Consistent with these studies, our results demonstrated that downregulation of miR-101-3p in CAFs also activated AKT/eNOS signaling pathway in lung cancer cells.In summary, our results demonstrated that miR-101-3p was downregulated in lung cancer-associated CAFs. Further mechanistic study showed that downregulation of miR-101-3p in CAFs increased VEGFA secretion, facilitating the metastasis potential of lung cancer cells via activation of Akt/eNOS signaling pathway (Figure 7D). Our finding suggests that modulation of miR-101-3p in CAFs might be a promising strategy for lung cancer treatment.Data Availability StatementThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.Ethics StatementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Tianjin Medical University General Hospital.

        "content": "The antiangiogenic extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in animals. However, the clinical relevance of such findings are equivocal as increased stromal TSP-1 expression has been associated with either good or poor prognosis. In an effort to obtain a more integrated understanding of the role of TSP-1 in breast cancer, we first used a breast tumorigenesis model in which tumor-associated stromal fibroblasts were engineered to produce high levels of TSP-1. We demonstrate here that stromal TSP-1 delayed human MDA-MB-231/B02 breast tumor growth. However, this delay in MDA-MB-231/B02 tumor growth upon exposure to TSP-1 was associated with an increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumor cells themselves, leading to a tumor growth rate comparable to that of tumors whose fibroblasts did not overproduce TSP-1. Clinical evidence also suggested that primary breast carcinomas have adapted to escape the effects of stromal TSP-1. TSP-1 was found to be expressed in the stroma of human breast carcinomas where, although its level correlated with decreased vascularization, it was unexpectedly associated with a reduction of relapse-free survival. In metastatic axillary lymph nodes, tumor cells expressed high levels of VEGF and TSP-1 expression were no longer associated with a decreased vascularization. Overall, these results suggest that a resistance may develop early in human breast cancers as a result of high in situ exposure to stromal TSP-1, leading to disease progression.",

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

The microRNAs related to cancers may act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, depending on the cancer type. The miR-200 family member genes are clustered at two locations in the genome: the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster and the miR-141/200c cluster. The miR-200 family members repress the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell migration, tumor growth, and metastasis by directly targeting specific genes, such as ZEB1, Suz12, moesin, and AP-2\u03b3. In contrast, the miR-200 family members have been shown to enhance the migration ability of breast cancer cells and to promote the metastatic colonization of breast cancer cells through up-regulating the expression of E-cadherin and down-regulating that of ZEB2 and Sec23a. In a recent study, high expression of the miR-200 family was associated with a high probability of relapse, poor survival, and distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. The loss of miR-200c expression has also been related to the induction of an aggressive, invasive, and chemoresistant phenotype of non\u2013small cell lung cancer. Conflicting results have been obtained in studies of the role of each miR-200 family member in repressing or enhancing cancer cell migration and invasion as well as the tumor growth and metastasis of diverse cancers, including breast cancer.Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacking estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a highly invasive and metastatic form of breast cancer with a generally poorer prognosis than that of other breast cancer subtypes. It is important to develop new treatment strategies based on a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms regulating the aggressive behavior of TNBCs. TNBCs express the miR-200 family members at a significantly lower level than do other subtypes of breast cancer, such as ER-positive or HER2-positive breast cancer. Only a small number of the miR-200 target genes that are involved in breast cancer cell migration and metastasis have been identified, and few studies of the role of the miR-200b/200a/429 or miR-141/200c cluster in human TNBC have been conducted. The biological relevance of the function of the miR-200b/200a/429 or miR-141/200c cluster in human TNBC remains to be discovered.Synthetic miR-200b directly downregulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in endothelial cells and prevents the diabetes-induced increase in VEGF, thus inhibiting angiogenesis in diabetic retinopathy. Chemokine CCL5 (formerly RANTES) of the CC-chemokine family, which plays a critical role in local invasion and distant metastasis in chondrosarcoma, promotes VEGF expression and angiogenesis by downregulating miR-200b. The miR-200c radiosensitized the lung cancer cell line, A549 by targeting the VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway. From these reports, we speculated that the overexpression of the miR-200 family can regulate the expression and secretion of cytokines and growth factors involving in cell growth and migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells.In the present study, we used MDA-MB-231 cells, a typical human TNBC cell line, which were stably transduced with lentivirus\u00a0carrying miR-200 family. We found that the overexpression of the miR-141/200c cluster promoted stronger migration and invasion as well as higher VEGF-A secretion in MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, we investigated, in detail, the mechanisms by which two miR-200 family members, the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster and the miR-141/200c cluster, regulated MDA-MB-231 cell migration and invasion. We demonstrate that the overexpression of the miR-141/200c cluster in MDA-MB-231 cells increased VEGF-A secretion, which enhanced the migratory ability of the cells through the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (ER-positive subtype), MDA-MB-231 and HCC-38 (TN subtype) were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). Hs578T cells (TN subtype) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) (WelGENE, Daegu, Korea) containing 10\u00a0% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and supplemented with a 1\u00a0% antibiotic solution containing penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco, Auckland, NZ). The MDA-MB-231, HCC-38, and Hs578T cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (WelGENE) containing 10\u00a0% FBS and supplemented with a 1\u00a0% antibiotic solution containing penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco). The MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HCC-38, and Hs578T cells used in this study were authenticated and validated by DNA fingerprinting (AmplFLSTR identifiler PCR Amplification kit), which was conducted by the Korean Cell Line Bank.Lentiviral transductionViral vectors containing either the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster (GenBank ID: 406984 406983) or the miR-141/200c cluster (GenBank ID: 406985 406933) constructs and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct were kindly supplied by Dr. Gregory J. Goodall of the University of Adelaide (Adelaide, Australia). A viral vector (pLenti M1.41) containing GFP was used as a control vector. Lentiviral transduction was conducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of approximately 10\u201325\u00a0% confluency (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells) in 6-well plates and were maintained at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with 5\u00a0% CO2. Following an overnight culture, the culture medium was removed. Aliquots of the lentiviral stocks containing the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster construct as well as the control virus were gently mixed with 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml polybrene and added to each well. After 6\u00a0h of transduction, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. Transduced cells with a cell density of greater than 90\u00a0% confluency were selected using medium containing 3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml puromycin for 2\u00a0weeks. Then, the GFP-positive cells were sorted from the selected cells using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cancer cells stably expressing the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster and GFP, denoted as miR-200ab cells and miR-200c cells, respectively, and cancer cells containing the pLenti M1.41 vector, denoted as control cells, were generated and expanded for use in all subsequent studies.Quantitative real-time PCRTaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems, South San Francisco, CA, USA) were used to quantify the levels of mature miRNAs, following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The miRNAs were isolated from cells using the mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems), and the specific primers for detecting miR-200a, miR-200b, and, miR-200c were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reverse transcription was performed using the TaqMan microRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The traditional TaqMan Assay control, 18\u00a0s rRNA, was used as the endogenous control. Each TaqMan Assay was conducted in triplicate.Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)The total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed using random hexamers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase. The cDNAs were synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and random primers. The mRNA levels in the miR-200 family-transduced cells and non-transduced cells, referred to as the control, were evaluated using the conventional RT-PCR method with the following primer sets: E-cadherin (421\u00a0bp), F, ATTCTGATTCTGCTGCTCTTG and R, AGTAGTCATAGTCCTGGTCTT; Vimentin (247\u00a0bp), F, CCCTCACCTGTGAAGTGGAT and R, TCCAGCAGCTTCCTGTAGGT; ZEB1 (150\u00a0bp), F, TTCAAACCCATAGTGGTTGCT and R, TGGGAGATACCAAACCAACTG; ZEB2 (127\u00a0bp), F, CAAGAGGCGCAAACAAGC and R, GGTTGGCAATACCGTCATCC; Snail (557\u00a0bp), F, CAGACCCACTCAGATGTCAA and R, CATAGTTAGTCACACCTCGT; Fibronectin (171\u00a0bp), F, CAGAATCCAAGCGGAGAGAG and R, CATCCTCAGGGCTCGAGTAG; and \u03b2-actin (335\u00a0bp), F, TTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTGTGG, and R, CGCCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGG. Each target gene was amplified using a Thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis through 1.5\u00a0% agarose gels, and the levels of gene expression were normalized to that of \u03b2-actin.Cell viability and proliferation assayIn vitro cell viability and proliferation were assessed using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells were allowed to adhere in a high-humidity environment in 5\u00a0% CO2 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in 96-well culture plates. At 1 d, 3 d, and 5 d after cell seeding, the MTT solution (a final concentration of 1\u00a0mg/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated for 1\u00a0h. At the end of the incubation period, the MTT solution was carefully removed, and 150\u00a0\u03bcl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to each well. The plates were maintained on a rocker shaker for 10\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and then the amount of MTT formazan crystals formed by the viable cells was determined using a spectrophotometer based on the absorbance at 540\u00a0nm (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Flow cytometry analysis using 7-AAD was performed to confirm cell viability.Migration and invasion assayTo assess the cell migratory ability, 2\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were suspended in 100\u00a0\u03bcl of medium with or without 10\u00a0% FBS and deposited in the upper chambers of a trans-well plate with 8.0-\u03bcm pores (BD Biosciences) with a non-coated membrane. For the invasion assays, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 2\u00a0% Matrigel\u2122 (BD Biosciences) basement membrane matrix-coated upper chambers in a trans-well plate with 8.0-\u03bcm pores. The lower chambers were filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcl of medium supplemented with 10\u00a0% FBS, and the cells were incubated for 48\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence or absence of an FAK inhibitor (5\u00a0\u03bcM PF573228, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), a PI3K/AKT inhibitor (20\u00a0\u03bcM LY294002, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml VEGF-neutralizing antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) or 10\u00a0ng/ml VEGF-A protein (Sigma). Each inhibitor, VEGF-neutralizing antibody, or VEGF-A were added in both the upper and lower chambers. No chemoattractants were used in the lower chamber for either the migration or invasion assays. The cells that migrated from the upper chamber were stained using a crystal violet solution (0.5\u00a0% crystal violet in 20\u00a0% methanol) for 5\u00a0min. Unbound crystal violet was removed by rinsing using distilled water. The cells were subsequently air-dried, and the crystal violet was eluted from the cells using a solution of 1\u00a0% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The absorbance of crystal violet at 550\u00a0nm was measured using a spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare).Wound-healing assayCells were seeded at 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells per well in six-well plates and cultured under permissive conditions until reaching 90\u00a0% confluence. After 24\u00a0h, each confluent cell monolayer was lightly and quickly scratched using a sterile plastic tip to produce a straight line. The debris was removed, and the edge of the scratch was smoothed by washing with PBS. The cells were cultured for 6\u00a0h in complete medium, after which, the lateral migratory activity was evaluated based on the area occupied by the cells that had entered the scratch line at 0\u00a0h. Images were acquired using a microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a CCD camera (Leica). The migration rates were calculated according to the equation percentage wound healing\u2009=\u2009{(wound length at 0\u00a0h) - (wound length at 6\u00a0h)} / (wound length at 0\u00a0h)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100. The mean results of three straight distances (upper edge, middle, and lower edge) in scratch area were evaluated as wound lengths. Length quantification was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).Measurement of cytokines and growth factorsSamples of 1\u20132\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After a two-day culture period, when cells were at 90\u00a0% confluency, the conditioned medium was harvested. The levels of secreted cytokines and growth factor (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFN--\u03b3, and VEGF-A) were quantified using the Bio-Plex200 multiplex array system according to the recommended protocol (Bio-Rad). All samples and standardized solutions were analyzed in triplicate.Western blottingThe cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma). The proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked using 5\u00a0% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween and incubated with primary antibodies directed against ERK, phospho-ERK, AKT (anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-AKT (anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling Technology), FAK (anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody, Invitrogen), phospho-FAK (anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody, Invitrogen), integrin-\u03b1V (anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or \u03b2-actin (anti-mouse polyclonal antibody, Sigma) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blotted membranes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare). Western blot quantification was performed using ImageJ software.Immunofluorescence stainingThe cells were seeded on sterile cover slips in 24-well plates. Then, the cells were fixed using a 4\u00a0% paraformaldehyde solution (Affymetrix, Cleveland, OH, USA). Primary antibodies directed against integrin-\u03b1V (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phospho-FAK (Invitrogen) were applied overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The bound integrin-\u03b1V and phospho-FAK antibodies were visualized using secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 594, and the nuclei were counterstained using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). All multicolor fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM5 Meta) (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Statistical analysesFor the entire dataset obtained in this study, the mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviations were calculated from the results of at least three independent experiments and were statistically evaluated using a one-way ANOVA followed by the t-test. For all tests, p-values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.ResultsOverexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster enhanced the migratory and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cellsProliferation, migration, and invasion of miR-200b/200a/429- or miR-141/200c-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. a Fluorescence images of green fluorescent protein in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells that were transduced using lentivirus encoding both GFP and miR-200 family members. Strong GFP expression was detected in the miR-200 family-transduced cells. Scale bar; 50\u00a0\u03bcm. b Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of microRNAs (miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c). The miR-200ab cells transduced with the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster construct exhibited high expression levels of miR-200a (~6-fold) and miR-200b (~40-fold) relative to those of the control cells. The miR-200c cells transduced with the miR-200c/141 cluster construct exhibited remarkably high expression levels of miR-200c (~93-fold) and miR-200b (~8-fold) relative to those of the control cells. c MTT assay for analysis of cell proliferation. The growth rate was significantly lower in the miR-200c cells (~4-fold) than in the control cells (~6-fold) at the 5th day. d Trans-well migration assay for the analysis of cell migration. e Trans-well invasion assay for the analysis of the invasive capacity. The migratory and invasive abilities of the miR-200ab and miR-200c cells (~2-fold) were significantly increased compared with those of the control cells. The enhanced migratory and invasive abilities were higher in miR-200c cells than in miR-200ab cells. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the values are the mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.001We first investigated alterations in the characteristics of two different breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, caused by the stable transduction of constructs encoding miR-200 family members and GFP using lentiviruses. The GFP-positive cells comprised more than 95\u00a0% of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2). Strong GFP expression in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was evaluated using microscopy (Fig.\u00a01a and Additional file 1: Figure S1A). RT-PCR was used to evaluate expression levels of EMT markers, and the results showed that the overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster resulted in the induction of E-cadherin expression and a decrease in ZEB-1 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1B). Overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 or miR-141/200c cluster led to increased expression of Snail in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.To investigate the stable overexpression of miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, real-time RT-PCR was conducted to quantify the levels of the mature microRNAs. As expected, the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells showed increased mature miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c levels at 5-100-fold higher levels than did the control MDA-MB-231 cells, which exhibited undetectable levels of all members of the miR-200 family (Fig.\u00a01b).To investigate whether overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 or miR-141/200c cluster affected cell growth, an MTT assay was performed. Figure\u00a01c shows that the growth rate of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells was similar to that of the control cells on the 3rd day but was significantly decreased on the 5th day after cell seeding compared with that of the control cells (control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.02 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.0002) (Fig.\u00a01c). The overexpression of the miR-141/200c cluster was found to more strongly suppress the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells.We assessed migratory and invasive abilities using a trans-well migration assay and a wound-healing assay. The results of crystal violet staining showed that the migratory ability of MCF-7 cells was suppressed by transduction of the miR-200 family, but there was no significant difference between that of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MCF-7 cells and control cells (Additional file 1: Figure S1C, E). The wound-healing assay, which demonstrated the lateral migratory ability of MCF-7 cells, yielded results similar to those of the trans-well migration assay (Additional file 1: Figure S1D, F).With regard to the trans-well migration and invasion assays of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, after 48\u00a0h of incubation without an FBS gradient, cell migration significantly increased up to 1.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22-fold and 2.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08-fold in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared with control cells (Fig.\u00a01d control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.04 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.002). To further investigate the migratory ability of miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, the trans-well migration assay under the condition of a 10\u00a0% FBS gradient in the upper (0\u00a0% FBS) and the lower chamber (10\u00a0% FBS) was conducted for 24\u00a0h. A significant increase was observed in the migratory ability of the miR-141/200c-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (1.53\u2009\u00b1\u20090.30-fold) relative to MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional file 3: Figure S3, p\u2009=\u20090.0009). As expected, the results of an invasion assay using Matrigel\u2122 matrix-coated trans-well membranes showed a significant increase in the invasive ability of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced cells (1.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31-fold) and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells (1.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.40-fold) after 48\u00a0h of incubation compared with that of control cells (Fig.\u00a01e, control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.0005 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.0002). The elevated migration and invasion rates were higher in miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells than miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. After 6\u00a0h of incubation, the transduction of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or miR-141/200c cluster did not affect the lateral migratory ability of MCF-7 cells, but increased the lateral migration up to 2.78\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11-fold and 1.69\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11-fold in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.02, Additional file 1: Figure S1F). In other TNBC cell lines, HCC-38 and Hs578T cells, we observed a significant increase in trans-well migration ability in both the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 cells (1.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11-fold, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced Hs578T cells (1.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.0003) compared with the control cells (Additional file 4: Figure S4A, D). The mature miR-200c levels in miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 and Hs578T cells were 252- and 205-fold higher than that in the control HCC-38 and Hs578T cells, which exhibited undetectable levels of miR-200c (p\u2009<\u20090.001, Additional file 5: Figure S5G, H).We found that the overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster resulted in the highest migratory capacity in MDA-MB-231 cells compared with the other TNBC cells, HCC-38 and Hs578T cells. Therefore, we focused on the regulatory mechanisms by which the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster promoted the migratory and invasive capacities of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, as a representative TNBC cell line.Overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster enhanced the phosphorylation of FAK and AKT and the expression of integrin in MDA-MB-231 cellsSignaling pathway associated with enhanced migration in miR-200b/200a/429 or miR-141/200c-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. a, b Western blotting analysis of the levels of phosphorylated FAK, AKT, ERK, and integrin-\u03b1V expression. The levels of FAK and AKT phosphorylation were significantly higher in the miR-200 family-transduced cells than in the control cells, but the level of ERK phosphorylation was similar between the miR-200 family-transduced cells and control cells. The miR-200 family-transduction also increased integrin-\u03b1V expression. Densitometric quantifications of FAK, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation in the miR-200 family-transduced cells relative to control cells. \u03b2\u2009\u2212\u2009actin was used as an internal reference. c Immunofluorescence analysis of phosphorylated FAK and integrin-\u03b1V. Phosphorylated FAK and integrin-\u03b1V were overexpressed and were highly localized at membrane surfaces in the miR-200 family-transduced cells. d Trans-well migration assay of FAK (PF573228) and PI3K/AKT (LY294002)-inhibitor-treated cells. Treatment with inhibitors of the FAK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways significantly suppressed the cell migration enhanced by the transduction of miR-200 family. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the values are the mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. *p\u2009<\u20090.05 **p\u2009<\u20090.001, Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcmWe investigated whether the overexpression of miR-200 family members modulated the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), PI3K/AKT, and MEK/ERK signaling pathways, which are involved in cell proliferation and migration. Representative western blotting results showed that the levels of FAK and AKT phosphorylation were greatly increased, but the level of ERK phosphorylation was not significantly changed in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a02a, left). The level of phosphorylated FAK was significantly increased up to 1.52\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26-fold and 3.12\u2009\u00b1\u20091.56-fold in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced cells and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a02a, right, control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.01 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.09). The level of phosphorylated AKT was also increased 2.21\u2009\u00b1\u20091.06-fold and 9.32\u2009\u00b1\u200911.07-fold in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced cells and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a02a, right, control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.19 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.32). We also observed that the miR-141/200c cluster significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of FAK (1.98\u2009\u00b1\u20090.37-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and AKT (5.61\u2009\u00b1\u20091.73-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.04) in HCC-38 cells (Additional file 6: Figure S6C, D). Representative western blotting results showed that the expression levels of integrin-\u03b1V, which is associated with the FAK signaling pathway, were increased in both the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells (Fig.\u00a02b, left). Integrin-\u03b1V expression was increased 1.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10-fold and 1.70\u2009\u00b1\u20090.24-fold in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced cells and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells, respectively (Fig.\u00a02b, right, control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.01 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.04). Integrin-\u03b1V expression was also increased (13.61\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.008) in miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 cells (Additional file 6: Figure S6C, D). To investigate the cellular localization of phosphorylated FAK and integrin-\u03b1V, immunofluorescent staining was assessed. Phosphorylated FAK was largely localized at the focal adhesions of the plasma membranes of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells (Fig.\u00a02c). Integrin-\u03b1V accumulated and clustered at the periphery of the plasma membranes of the miR-200b/200a/429- and miR-141/200c-transduced cells compared with that in control cells (Fig.\u00a02c). The levels of FAK phosphorylation and integrin-\u03b1V expression were higher in the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 cells than in the control cells (Additional file 6: Figure S6E).To determine the signaling pathway involved in enhanced migratory and invasive ability of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, trans-well migration assays were performed in the presence of PF573228 or LY294002, which are chemical inhibitors of FAK and PI3K/AKT, respectively. The chemical inhibitors were added to both the upper and lower chambers, which would allow their effects to last throughout the entire experimental period. The enhanced migratory activity was completely inhibited in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the FAK or PI3K/AKT inhibitor, reaching the basal migratory level of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a02d). These observations demonstrated that the elevated migratory ability of MDA-MB-231 cells by stable overexpression of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or miR-141/200c cluster was driven by the activation of the FAK and PI3K/AKT-mediated signaling pathways.Overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster increased the level of VEGF-A secretion in MDA-MB-231 cellsMigration and invasion in miR-200b/200a/429 or miR-141/200c-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells treated with an anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibody. a Measurement of the secreted levels of cytokines and growth factors (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF-A). Transduction of the miR-200 family into MDA-MB-231 cells promoted significantly higher VEGF-A secretion than that of control cells. b Western blotting analysis of the levels of VEGF-A. c Trans-well migration and d invasion assay of anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibody-treated cells. The enhanced migration and invasion of the miR-200 family-transduced cells were significantly suppressed by treatment with anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies. e, f Representative image of western blotting of phosphorylated AKT, FAK, and ERK and total AKT, FAK and ERK in cells treated with anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies for 30\u00a0min and 48\u00a0h. The elevated phosphorylation levels of FAK and AKT in only miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells but not miR-200b/200a/429-transduced cells were decreased by the anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibody, whereas the phosphorylation level of ERK was increased in miR-141/200c -transduced cells and control cells treated with anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the values are the mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. N.D: not detectable. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.001The secreted cytokines or growth factors that might be involved in regulating the migration of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells were analyzed. The levels of IL-2, GM-CSF, and IFN-\u03b3 secreted into the medium by the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells after 48\u00a0h of culture were lower than those of the control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the secreted VEGF-A levels were significantly higher in the conditioned medium of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced cells (1.64\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03-fold) and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells (2.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09-fold) than in that of the control MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a03a, control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.007 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.0007). Increased secretion of VEGF-A was higher in miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells than miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced cells (miR-200ab vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.0001). The secreted levels of cytokines and growth factors were also evaluated in the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 and Hs578T cells. VEGF-A secretions were significantly increased in miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 (1.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.00001) and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced Hs578T cells (1.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.004) relative to control cells (Additional file 4: Figure S4B, E). The effect of miR-141/200c overexpression on increased cell migration and VEGF-A secretion was greater in MDA-MB-231 cells relative to HCC-38 and Hs578T cells. There were no definite differences in VEGF-A secretion levels between the miR-141/200c cluster\u2013transduced Hs578T and the control Hs578T cells. These results were explained by the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity among cancer cells in TNBC cells. The VEGF-A expression levels were also examined in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, but the transduction of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster (1.18\u2009\u00b1\u20090.31-fold) or miR-141/200c cluster (0.90\u2009\u00b1\u20090.34-fold) did not affect VEGF-A expression (Fig.\u00a03b, right, control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.38 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.45). The miR-141/200c cluster\u2013transduced HCC-38 cells (0.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.09-fold) also expressed VEGF-A levels that were similar to the control HCC-38 cells (Additional file 6: Figure S6A, B, p\u2009=\u20090.46).Blocking VEGF-A activity inhibited the enhanced migration and invasion of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cellsTo examine whether secreted VEGF-A regulates the migratory and invasive abilities of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, trans-well migration and invasion assays were performed after treatment with anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies. The anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies were added to both the upper and lower chamber, which would allow their effects to last throughout the entire experimental period. Figure\u00a03c, d d showed that the anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies completely inhibited the increased migratory (control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.0001 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and invasive (control vs. miR-200ab, p\u2009=\u20090.02 and control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009=\u20090.001) abilities of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced cells. These data clearly indicated that secreted VEGF-A was involved in promoting the migration and invasion of both miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR141/200c cluster-transduced cells. The administration of anti-VEGF-A-antibodies for neutralizing VEGF-A in cultured medium suppressed the migration increased by miR-141/200c overexpression in both the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced Hs578T cells (Additional file 4: Figure S4C, F). The anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies also completely inhibited the increased migratory ability (control vs. miR-200c, p\u2009<\u20090.001) of the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced HCC-38 cells (Additional file 4: Figure S4C, untreated vs. VEGF-A Ab, p\u2009<\u20090.001). These results supported that VEGF-A secretion was associated with enhancing migration ability in TNBC cells. The anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies partly blocked the enhanced migratory ability (control vs. miR-200c, untreated, 1.76\u2009\u00b1\u20090.44-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.0003) of both the control (0.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced Hs578T cells (1.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21-fold, p\u2009=\u20090.003), but the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced Hs578T cells still showed increased migratory ability compared with that of the control cells (control vs. miR-200c, VEGF-A Ab treated, p\u2009<\u20090.001, Additional file 4: Figure S4F). These results imply that other factors besides VEGF-A may also be involved in promoting migration in miR-141/200c cluster-transduced Hs578T cells.The miR-141/200c cluster activated the FAK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by secreted VEGF-A, resulting in the promotion of the migratory and invasive abilities of MDA-MB-231 cellsTo ascertain the VEGF-A-mediated intracellular signaling pathway responsible for the increased migratory and invasive abilities of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, the levels of FAK and AKT phosphorylation were evaluated in cells treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies. Treatment with anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies for both 30\u00a0min and 48\u00a0h remarkably decreased the level of FAK and AKT phosphorylation in the miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells and the control cells but did not affect the level of phosphorylated FAK and AKT in the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a03e, f ). In contrast, the level of ERK phosphorylation was increased by anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies in miR-141/200c-transduced cells and control cells. These data implied that FAK and AKT acted as a direct link between elevated VEGF-A secretion and the consequential signal transduction related to enhanced migration of miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, but the increased secretion of VEGF-A in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells was not directly followed by activation of the FAK and AKT-mediated signaling pathway, which was possibly induced by the other signaling pathways.Exogenous VEGF-A stimulated migration of MDA-MB-231 cells by activating the FAK and PI3K/AKT pathwayMigration and signaling pathways in VEGF-A-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells. a Images of the crystal violet-stained cells that migrated horizontally in the trans-well migration assay. b The absorbance values of extracted crystal violet in migrated cells.

All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and the values are the mean values\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation. *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.001To confirm the role of VEGF-A as a migration-activating mediator in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- or miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells, a trans-well migration assay was assessed in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with exogenous VEGF-A protein. The representative crystal violet staining of exogenous VEGF-A (10\u00a0ng/ml)-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells that had migrated through the trans-well membranes after 48\u00a0h is shown in Fig.\u00a04a. A quantitative analysis of a crystal violet assay showed that exogenous VEGF-A significantly increased MDA-MB-231 cell migration up to 1.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16-fold but had no effect on the migratory ability of MCF-7 cells compared with that of untreated cells (Fig.\u00a04b, untreated vs. VEGF-A, p\u2009=\u20090.003). In addition, we investigated whether VEGF-A played a role as a migration-activating mediator in HCC-38 cells. As expected, VEGF-A treatment significantly increased HCC-38 cell migration up to 1.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26-fold (Additional file 7: Figure S7B, untreated vs. VEGF-A, p\u2009<\u20090.001).To verify the exogenous VEGF-A-mediated intracellular signaling pathways responsible for the increased migratory ability of MDA-MB-231 cells, the levels of FAK, AKT, and ERK phosphorylation were evaluated. After cell starvation for 4\u00a0h, treatment with exogenous VEGF-A for 15\u00a0min, 30\u00a0min, 60\u00a0min, and 48\u00a0h induced the periodic fluctuation of the phosphorylation levels of FAK and AKT and generally increased phosphorylated FAK and AKT, but did not affect the phosphorylation level of ERK in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.\u00a04c, d). These data indicated that the activation of the FAK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways mediated by the exogenous VEGF-A increased the migratory ability of MDA-MB-231 cells. Similar results that VEGF-A stimulated FAK, AKT, and ERK were also observed in HCC-38 cells (Additional file 7: Figure S7C, D).DiscussionThe role of miR-200 family in regulating the migration and invasion of different cancer cell types is controversial. Moreover, only a small number of miR-200 target genes that regulate cell migration and cancer metastasis has been identified, and the mechanisms underlying the functions of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster and miR-141/200c cluster in TNBC cells are not fully understood. It is well-known that the miR-200 family expression levels are significantly lower in highly migratory TNBC cells and metastatic TNBC tumors than other types of breast cancer cells and tumors. In addition, Vrba L et al. reported the repression of miR-200 and miR-141 expression due to aberrant epigenetic gene silencing in aggressive cancer cells, including MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that the downregulation of miR-200 may contribute to an aggressive TNBC phenotype. ZEB1 and SIP1 have been found to repress primary transcript and mature miR-200 expression in mesenchymal types of breast cancer cells, suggesting a downregulation of miR-200 in TNBC cells through a potential double-negative feedback loop between ZEB1/SIP1 and the miR-200 family. Manav K et al. reported the highest expression of miR-200s in the highly metastatic 4T1 cells, a mouse TNBC cell line, which was consistent with acquisition of epithelial traits in 4T1 cells compared with the weakly metastatic 4TO7 cells. In addition, 4T1 tumors exhibit spontaneous metastasis and colonization of distant organs, which is enhanced by miR-200 overexpression in experimental animal models, furthermore, higher expression of miR-200 levels were found in lung-pleural metastasis samples relative to primary tumor samples in breast cancer patients. These data support the potential role of miR-200s in migration, invasion, metastatic colonization, and metastatic dissemination. Recently, Avery-Kiejda KA et al. found that the miR-200 cluster is upregulated in invasive ductal carcinomas with both lymph node-positive and lymph node-negative TNBC compared with matched normal adjacent tissues. Their reports of in vivo experimental and clinical evidence may indicate that tumor cell populations with increased aggressiveness may have higher miR-200 cluster levels than their less aggressive counterparts within the same TNBC and in normal tissues, the miR-200 cluster, though being generally reduced in TNBC compared with other subtypes, is upregulated in TNBC cells that may support metastatic dissemination. We showed here that the overexpression of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or miR-141/200c cluster strongly promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231, HCC-38, and Hs578T cells, typical claudin-low and mesenchymal subtypes of TNBC cell lines, compared with those of an ER-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7 cells. The migratory and invasive ability of MDA-MB-231 cells was substantially more enhanced in those that overexpressed the miR-141/200c cluster than in those with the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster. These data suggest that the different roles of the miR-200 family members, such as miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429, on the migration and invasion of different subtypes of human breast cancer cell lines classified by molecular characterization should be further investigated.Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has been implicated in mammary carcinogenesis and was suggested to be the mechanism underlying the survival of invasive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, an activated AKT signaling pathway, a common dysregulation observed in breast cancers, has been shown to promote cancer cell growth, survival, and metastasis. FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays crucial roles in integrin-mediated signal transduction, and FAK localizes to the sites where transmembrane integrin receptors are clustered to mediate various intracellular signal-transduction pathways. Many recent studies have reported that an increased level of FAK expression highly correlates with the invasiveness and metastasis of human tumors. We found that the phosphorylation levels of AKT and FAK in MDA-MB-231 cells were elevated by stable overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster and the miR-141/200c cluster. Additionally, increased integrin-\u03b1V and phosphorylated FAK co-localized in the transmembrane of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster- and miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. These data suggest that the stable overexpression of the 200b/200a/429 cluster and the miR-141/200c cluster in MDA-MB-231 cells may affect the secretion of cytokines or growth factors to activate FAK or the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The regulation between the miR-200 family and FAK is not fully understood. A model indicating that a stiffer matrix of breast cancers will activate FAK, which inhibits the miR-200 family and allow for a mesenchymal phenotype has been proposed. This model is not consistent with our observation that the overexpression of the miR-141/200c cluster or the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster increased clustering and expression of integrins and activated FAK and AKT, which regulate cell migration. Our finding proposes a positive cross-talk between FAK and overexpressed miR-200 in TNBC cells.Many studies have been aimed at understanding the role of cytokines and growth factors in breast cancer progression. Some cytokines and growth factors (IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, TGF-\u03b2, and VEGF) stimulate the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells, whereas others (IL-12, IL-18, and IFN) suppress breast cancer progression. A recent study reported that miR-200 inhibits angiogenesis by targeting IL-8 and CXCL1 secreted by tumor endothelial and cancer cells. Our study demonstrated that the overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster in MDA-MB-231 cells led to a decrease in the secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, GM-CSF, INF-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 but a significant increase in the secretion of VEGF-A. VEGF has been reported to activate the PI3K/AKT/forkhead signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis in human endothelial cells. In addition, VEGF-A, the most potent angiogenic factor in tumor angiogenesis, induces oligodendrocyte precursor cell migration through a ROS- and FAK-dependent mechanism. VEGF-A is known to be a direct target of miR-200b, but in our results, a significant decrease in VEGF-A levels assessed by western blotting was not observed in miR-200b/200a/429- and miR-141/200c-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells or in miR-141/200c-transduced HCC-38 cells relative to control. Moreover, VEGF-A secretions in MDA-MB-231, HCC-38, and Hs578T cells were increased by the overexpression of the miR-141/200c cluster. The comprehensive interactions between miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) are expected to comprise \u201cwired\u201d genetic networks to regulate the expression of target genes. In examples of an incoherent feed-forward loop, the direct regulatory effect of TFs on the target gene (VEGF-A) is opposed to the indirect regulatory effect through miR-200 regulation. Taking the comprehensive interactions between miRNAs and protein-coding genes, we propose that miR-200 overexpression in TNBC cells can affect TFs (HIF-1, CREB) or signals (PI3K/AKT) to regulate VEGF-A secretion through an incoherent feed-forward loop. An autocrine loop for VEGF-A to induce breast cancer cell migration/invasion has been well documented. From these reports, we assume that the VEGF-A secreted by miR-200 overexpression interacts with its receptors, such as neuropilin-1 (NP-1) and VEGFR, and stimulates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, thus promoting TNBC cell migration and invasion. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with VEGF-A led to an increase in migratory ability and activated FAK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells and HCC-38 cells. Our results strongly support that VEGF-A-mediated FAK or PI3K/AKT signaling pathway modulates cancer cell migration and invasion. By down-regulating miR-200b expression through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, the chemokine CCL5 (formerly RANTES) promotes VEGF-dependent angiogenesis in human chondrosarcomas. In addition, synthetic miR-200c downregulates VEGF-A by the direct targeting of the 3\u2019UTR of VEGF-A mRNA in a lung cancer cell line. Contrary to above studies, in this study, the stable overexpression of the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster and the miR-141/200c cluster in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in increased VEGF-A secretion and induced AKT and FAK phosphorylation. Blocking the PI3K/AKT or FAK signaling pathways using chemical inhibitors inhibited the enhanced migration and invasion in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster. Inhibiting the VEGF-A-mediated pathway using anti-VEGF-A-neutralizing antibodies suppressed the elevated AKT and FAK phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing miR-141/200c cluster, reversing the enhanced migratory and invasive abilities. These results suggest that the activation of FAK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway are directly mediated by elevated VEGF-A secretion, which is involved in the increased migratory and invasive abilities of miR-141/200c cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, FAK- and PI3K/AKT-independent signaling pathways activated by VEGF-A may lead to an enhanced migratory ability in miR-200b/200a/429 cluster-transduced MDA-MB-231 cells. The present study implies that aberrant expression of miR-200b/200a/429 cluster or the miR-141/200c cluster may play a pro-metastasis role leading to the promotion of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells.ConclusionsThe stable overexpression of the miR-141/200c cluster promoted the migratory and invasive ability of TNBC cells through the strong activation of FAK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by increasing VEGF-A secretion compared with the miR-200b/200a/429 cluster.AbbreviationsAKT, protein kinase B; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; miR-200, microRNA-200; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factorAdditional filesReferencesMicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and functionCauses and consequences of microRNA dysregulation in cancerMicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancersThe miR-200 family inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell migration by direct targeting of E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2miR-200a inhibits tumor proliferation by targeting AP-2gamma in neuroblastoma cellsDirect targeting of Sec23a by miR-200\u00a0s influences cancer cell secretome and promotes metastatic colonizationmiR-200 enhances mouse breast cancer cell colonization to form distant metastasesOverexpression of microRNA-200c predicts poor outcome in patients with PR-negative breast cancerLoss of miR-200c expression induces an aggressive, invasive, and chemoresistant phenotype in non-small cell lung cancerThe emerging role of miR-200 family of microRNAs in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasisA reciprocal repression between ZEB1 and members of the miR-200 family promotes EMT and invasion in cancer cellsThe triple negative paradox: primary tumor chemosensitivity of breast cancer subtypesIntegrated microRNA and mRNA signatures associated with survival in triple negative breast cancerMicroRNA-200b regulates vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated alterations in diabetic retinopathyCCL5 promotes VEGF-dependent angiogenesis by down-regulating miR-200b through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in human chondrosarcoma cellsMiR-200c increases the radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung cancer cell line A549 by targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 pathwayRole for DNA methylation in the regulation of miR-200c and miR-141 expression in normal and cancer cellsA double-negative feedback loop between ZEB1-SIP1 and the microRNA-200 family regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transitionDecreased expression of key tumour suppressor microRNAs is associated with lymph node metastases in triple negative breast cancerIdentification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapiesMolecular characterisation of cell line models for triple-negative breast cancersTargeting PI3K signalling in cancer: opportunities, challenges and limitationsTake your PIK: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors race through the clinic and toward cancer therapyFocal adhesion kinase and its signaling pathways in cell migration and angiogenesisExpression of focal adhesion kinase gene and invasive cancerTyrosine kinase activity, cytoskeletal organization, and motility in human vascular endothelial cellsFAK activation is required for IGF1R-mediated regulation of EMT, migration, and invasion in mesenchymal triple negative breast cancer cellsMechanisms by which the extracellular matrix and integrin signaling act to regulate the switch between tumor suppression and tumor promotionCytokines in breast cancerTumour angiogenesis regulation by the miR-200 familyVascular endothelial growth factor activates PI3K/Akt/forkhead signaling in endothelial cellsVascular endothelial growth factor regulates the migration of oligodendrocyte precursor cellsRegulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling by miR-200bImpact of microRNA regulation on variation in human gene expressionNon-angiogenic functions of VEGF in breast cancerAutocrine functions of VEGF in breast tumor cells: adhesion, survival, migration and invasion"

As primary and metastatic tumors grow, the secretion of a considerable number of unbalanced factors is able to trigger the formation of new vessels through the process of angiogenesis. One of these factors, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), is a key mediator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis and a validated target for antiangiogenesis therapy in the clinic. However, extensive clinical experience targeting VEGF-VEGFR agents has shown that this is not always the case. For example, several phase III clinical trials failed to provide evidence of overall survival (OS) benefit in bevacizumab arms for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Small molecule antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), mainly against VEGFR2, have not shown efficacy in breast cancer treatment until today . These considerations, combined with the observation that tumor vessels can develop resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, highlight the need to identify effective anti-angiogenesis therapies that are based on VEGF-independent targets and can be used in combination with anti-VEGF independent therapy to improve outcomes for patients.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major stromal residents and a main producer of paracrine signals, are highly involved in the development of tumors through the secretion of cytokines and angiogenic factors. On the one hand, studies have revealed that CAFs may activate multiple signaling pathways in endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis by secreting versatile signaling molecules in addition to VEGFA. CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into invasive human breast cancers, an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. Functionally, coculture of FAP-positive CAFs with endothelial cells can stimulate angiogenesis as measured by sprouting in colorectal cancer. Interestingly, CAFs from resistant EL4 tumors can also mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy via VEGF-independent PDGF-C signaling. On the other hand, the tumor stroma exhibits drastic changes at the transcriptional level, which can be useful prognostic predictors of cancer progression. Activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor STAT3 in CAFs promotes colorectal tumor development and correlates with poor prognosis. Strikingly, STAT3 effects in colorectal neoplasia may be at least partially due to modulation of proangiogenic signaling. Transcription factor ZEB1 deletion in stromal CAFs reduces the expression and secretion of a variety of paracrine signaling molecules, including FGF2, FGF7, VEGFA and IL6, to suppress tumor initiation, progression and metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer partially associated with decreased angiogenesis. However, the complicated mechanism underlying how breast CAFs promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis in transcriptional addiction is not well understood.Fos-like antigen 2 (FOSL2/FRA-2) belongs to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, which includes the various isoforms of Fos and Jun. FOSL2 exerts a specific function in bone development and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and appears to have selective physiological and pathological roles in diverse processes, including the development of immune cells and endocrinology processes. In addition, enhanced FOSL2 expression has been documented in some carcinomas, such as colon, hepatocellular, ovarian and breast cancer.Remarkably, FOSL2 transgenic mice resemble the core clinical features of SSc, as they display fibrotic and destructive microvascular manifestations of SSc. Increased local FOSL2 levels in cardiac perivascular adipose tissue (C-PVAT) possibly contribute to perivascular angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. AP-1 transcription factors (including FOSL2) act in concert to drive ischemia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) transcription, which plays an essential role in angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. However, the role of tumor stroma-derived FOSL2 signaling in tumors has not been clarified.Wnt5a, a secreted glycoprotein, belongs to the noncanonical Wnt family. Wnt5a and its downstream signaling pathway can regulate fundamental cellular processes, including specification of cell fate, proliferation, and survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that Wnt5a exhibits dual effects on tumor progression. For example, Wnt5a plays a pro-tumorigenic role in gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, in contrast to thyroid and colorectal cancer. However, the role of Wnt5a in breast cancer is controversial and depends on the availability of key receptors and intercellular interactions among different cell types. Recently, new evidence has indicated that Wnt5a may play a role in angiogenesis and chemoresistance. Our mRNA expression profile suggested high expression of Wnt5a in breast CAFs. The interesting question of whether stromal Wnt5a in breast CAFs is involved in angiogenesis remains to be determined.Here, we are the first to probe the expression patterns of FOSL2 in breast CAFs and investigate the underlying mechanism, in which FOSL2 is critical for VEGF-independent angiogenesis by transcriptionally regulating Wnt5a. Moreover, we unveiled the clinical significance of the FOSL2/Wnt5a axis to gain insights into its pro-angiogenic function in the development and progression of breast carcinoma, suggesting potential novel therapeutic strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy.Material and MethodsClinical samples, stromal fibroblast isolation, immortalization, and cell cultureHuman breast tumor tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues (at least 5 cm away from tumor) were obtained from patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. All the patients involved in this study did not receive any radiotherapy or chemotherapy previously. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.The isolation, immortalization, identification and culture of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from breast tumor patients were previously well established as described in our previous publication. NFs and CAFs were cultured in DMEM medium (GIBCO, USA) with 10% FBS (GIBCO, USA) at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.RNA interference, plasmids, and reagentsFOSL2- or Wnt5a-knockdown cells were produced by lentivirus-mediated transduction using synthetic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) oligonucleotides (GenePharama, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were used to transiently knock down CYP19A1 or FZD5 (GenePharama, Shanghai, China). The sequences of shRNA and small interfering RNA used are listed in Table S1. FOSL2 overexpressing lentivirus were purchased from GeneCopoeia (Guangzhou, China), and viral supernatant was used to infect NFs in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene according to the manufacturer's instructions.The pcDNA3.1(+)-FOSL2 plasmid was created by amplifying FOSL2 from CAFs and was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The synthesized nucleotide wild type (WT), truncated or mutant (Mut) Wnt5a promoter was inserted into pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (GenePharma, China), respectively. The reagents used in this study are as follows: the neutralizing antibody against VEGF (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech, Switzerland), 0.2 mg/mL; axitinib (Selleck, USA), 5 nM; CCK8 (Beyotime, China), 5 mg/mL; SQ22536 (Selleck, China), 100 \u00b5M; H89 (Selleck, China), 5 \u00b5M; rWnt5a (R&D Systems, USA), 5 \u00b5g/mL; BOX5 (Merck Millipore, USA), 5 \u00b5M. The usage of rWnt5a and BOX5 in xenografts was described in animal experiments in detail.RNA extraction and qRT-PCRTotal-RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Takara, China) and was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, China) by CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, USA). The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in the Table S2.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)The deparaffinized tissue sections at 4 \u00b5m thickness were heated for antigen retrieval at 95 \u00b0C in citric acid buffer (pH 6.0). After treating with 3% H2O2, the sections were blocked with 5% goat normal serum, and incubated with primary antibody against CD31 (1:100, ab9498, Abcam, UK) and FOSL2 (1:800, ab124830, Abcam, UK), separately. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining as described previously. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on preprepared coverslips for 24 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated by 0.1% triton-100, and incubated with 5% goat serum. The specific antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (1:150, ab5694, Abcam, UK), FAP (1:100, #66562, CST, USA) and CD31 (1:80, ab9498, Abcam, UK) were employed in the IF staining. The normal rabbit IgG was the negative control. The nuclei were stained with DAPI and the images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Japan).Luciferase assayCAFs (1\u00d7105 per well) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The cells were transfected with the Wnt5a promoter vectors (pGL3-Wnt5a-WT, pGL3-Wnt5a-truncated, pGL3-Wnt5a-Mut), control vector pGL3 and internal control pRL-TK (Promega, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000. After culture for 30 h, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega, USA), and luciferase activity was measured. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.Western blotting and ELISA assaysCell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The specific primary antibodies used in western blotting analysis were as follows: FOSL2 (1:1000, ab124830, Abcam, UK), Wnt5a (1:1000, ab179824, Abcam, UK), VEGFA (1:1000, ab1316, Abcam, UK); p-VEGFR2 (1:800, D155165, Sangon, China), T-VEGFR2 (1:1000, D151118, Sangon, China); T-AKT (1:1000, #9272, CST, USA), p-AKT (1:1000, #2965, CST, USA), T-ERK (1:1000, #9102, CST, USA), p-ERK (1:1000, #4348, CST, USA), T-P65 (1:1000, #8242, CST, USA), p-P65 (1:1000, #3033, CST, USA) and \u03b2-actin (1:1000, Biosharp, China).For detection of secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of NFs and CAFs, proteins contained in the supernatant were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra15 Centrifugal Filter Device (Merck Millipore, USA). Concentrated supernatants (30 \u03bcL) were used for western blotting analysis. For ELISA, conditioned medium was collected from 1\u00d7106 NFs or CAFs in a 6-well plate, and the concentrations of VEGFA (Raybiotech, USA) and cAMP (R&D System, USA) were determined by a standard ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize the effect of cell number on the concentration of secreted proteins, supernatants from fibroblasts seeded at the same cell density were collected after a short incubation period (24 h), and cell numbers were counted at the CM collection time point. For detection of Wnt5a in patient serum and cellular Wnt5a of tumors, patients' peripheral venous blood was collected before surgery, and the blood and tumor tissue lysate were centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min to collect supernatants. The supernatants from serum and extracts of fresh tumor tissues were used to detect Wnt5a levels using an ELISA kit (Wuhan Purity Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and VEGF-neutralizing antibody treatmentThe stromal fibroblasts (1\u00d7106) were seeded into a 6-well plate in growth medium for 6 h. After removing the growth medium, FBS-free medium (1 mL) was added to further culture the cells for 24 h, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM). To exclude the potential side effects of cell proliferation of CAFs and NFs (e.g., the engineered CAFs and NFs, and their control cells) on CM, cell proliferation, and protein concentration (using Bradford assay kit, Beyotime, China) of CM were carefully determined at the CM collection time point. For neutralization experiments, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF was preincubated at 4 \u00b0C with 1 mL supernatant for 6 h, and the removal of the VEGF effect in the supernatant was proved by ELISA assay. Then, the supernatant was used for HUVEC coculture in tubulogenesis or sprouting experiments. To rule out protein differences in the potential number of cells at the terminal time point of CM harvest, the protein concentration of CM derived from stromal fibroblasts was normalized using the protein concentration deviation value between the test fibroblasts and their control fibroblasts and adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration of control cells to diminish the personal error of cell planting.Invasion assaysStromal fibroblast-mediated HUVEC invasion was evaluated using an 8 \u00b5m pore chamber (Millipore, USA) coated with Matrigel (Corning, USA) as described previously. Cells were allowed to invade toward the medium in the lower chamber, and the invaded HUVECs on the opposite side of the filter were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted after 16 h.Tubule formation and three-dimensional sprouting assaysGrowth factor-reduced Matrigel basement membrane matrix (Corning, USA) was slowly thawed on ice, and 50 \u00b5L of Matrigel was added to each well of a 96-well plate for polymerization. A total of 1\u00d7104 suspended HUVECs were added on top of the Matrigel matrix and treated with the supernatants from CM pretreated with or without VEGF-neutralizing antibody, axitinib, rWnt5a (5 \u00b5g/mL) or BOX5 (a Wnt5a antagonist, 5 \u00b5M) for 24 h. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h, pictures were captured in a 40\u00d7 field and analyzed using ImageJ software. For endothelial cell sprouting assays, HUVECs (1\u00d7103) were cultured with medium containing 0.24% carboxymethylcellulose in nonadherent round-bottom 96-well plates overnight. Spheroids were collected by centrifugation at 400 \u00d7 g and mixed with 2 mg/mL collagen type I (Corning, USA) and FBS-free medium. The three-dimensional fibrin gel was then covered with CM and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 24 h. Endothelial sprouting was analyzed with at least 10 spheroids per group and quantified by recording the branch number under a microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assayChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Magnetic Beads) #9005 (CST, USA). Three primer sets were designed to flank the related putative FOSL2-binding sites in the promoter region of VEGF (Table S3). Briefly, FOSL2-transfected NFs (1.2\u00d7107) were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and sonicated (60 W). Then, the chromatin associated with FOSL2 was pulled down using an anti-FOSL2 antibody or control human IgG. The amounts of the specific DNA fragments were then quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to the genomic DNA prepared from the same cells. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.E2 production assayCells were seeded in six-well plates (2\u00d7106 cells/well) and cultured to 50% confluence. Testosterone was added at 100 nM. The cells were cultured for 48 h, and the medium was harvested for E2 detection using the Access E2 Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter, USA) in the Endocrinology Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.Orthotopic xenograftsThe orthotopic tumor xenograft models were generated as described previously. Animal experiments were approved by the animal care ethics committees at Chongqing Medical University. MDA-MB-231 cells (1\u00d7106) were mixed with an equal number of CAFs/scramble, CAFs/shFOSL2, NFs/vector or NFs/FOSL2 in 200 \u00b5L of PBS:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice (7 mice per group). Tumor size was measured by calipers every 4 days; volume was calculated ((L \u00d7 W2) \u00d7 0.5). When the tumor volume was approximately 50 mm3, a group of mice implanted with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/scramble or CAF/shFOSL2 was separately intraperitoneally administered anti-VEGF antibody (5 mg/kg, twice a week; for 5 consecutive weeks) (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech); a group of mice injected with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/shFOSL2 was treated with rWNT5A (1 ng/1 g body weight, twice weekly, for 5 consecutive weeks); and a group of tumor burden mice with MDA-MB-231 and NF/FOSL2 was injected with BOX5 (0.5 \u00b5g/1 g body weight, once per day, for 5 consecutive weeks). The mice were sacrificed, and xenografts were harvested at 40 days. At the end of animal experiments, tumors were serially sectioned into 4 \u03bcm sections and stained with CD31 for subsequent blinded evaluation of MVD.ResultsHigh FOSL2 expression in breast stromal CAFs is closely associated with tumor angiogenesis and clinical progressStudies investigating the link between CAFs and angiogenesis have been increasingly revealing and demonstrating that the crosstalk between CAFs and endothelial cells facilitates multiple hallmark processes in angiogenesis, where CAFs can even mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. To better understand the characteristics and functions of CAFs associated with tumor angiogenesis, we set out to investigate the transcriptome of breast stromal fibroblasts by microarray analysis using primary CAFs and NFs derived from breast tumor tissues. A set of transcription factors was found to be upregulated in CAFs. Among them, 20 transcription factors were inversely downregulated in preeclampsia (PE) (Figure 1A). The placental phenotype of PE is largely attributed to vascular dysfunction of the placenta, which has been driven by an imbalance of angiogenic signals. PE is concomitant with significantly altered decreased angiogenic factors (VEGF, placental growth factor (PLGF), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)) and increased soluble antiangiogenic factors (e.g., soluble fmslike tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and soluble endoglin (sEng)). As shown in the heatmap of the 20 TFs from the mRNA microarray (Figure 1B), FOSL2, SATB1 and GATA6 in CAFs were identified as candidate transcription factors in the progression of angiogenesis in breast cancer. We isolated 12 pairs of primary CAFs and corresponding NFs from breast cancer and noncancer tissues, and the purities of CAFs were identified by the activated fibroblast biomarkers \u03b1-SMA, FAP and vascular endothelial marker CD31 (a biomarkers of endothelial cells as control) as previously reported (Figure S1A). After analysis of other conventional CAF marker genes (e.g. S100A4, PDGFR\u03b2, PDPN, and CAV1), S100A4 and CAV1 were found to be increased in primary breast CAFs compared with NFs at the mRNA level (Figure S1B). The expression of three candidate transcription factors was then verified in 3 cases of primary mammary fibroblasts from breast reduction surgery and 12 paired primary breast CAFs and NFs by qRT-PCR, and FOSL2 had the most significant and stable expression in primary CAFs (Figure S1C). Subsequently, the high level of FOSL2 protein was almost confirmed in 12 paired primary CAFs by western blotting analysis (Figure 1C). Likewise, the high level of FOSL2 in immortalized CAFs was also detected by qRT-PCR (Figure S1D) and western blotting (Figure 1D), which had a similar expression pattern as in primary CAFs (thus, the immortalized CAFs could be used as a cell model in this study). To further understand the expression of stromal FOSL2 in breast tumor tissues and evaluate the correlation of stromal FOSL2 with the clinical characteristics of breast cancer, FOSL2 proteins were examined in 117 paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Detailed information on stromal FOSL2 expression and the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients are listed in Table S3. The high level of stromal FOSL2 was significantly related to tumor stage (Figure S1E and Figure 1E). In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the expression of stromal FOSL2 was inversely correlated with the overall survival of patients (Figure 1F). Meanwhile, the denser microvessel density (MVD), which was evaluated by CD31 staining, was greater in stromal FOSL2 highly expressed tumor tissues than in stromal FOSL2 low expressed tissues (p<0.001) (Figure 1G-H). The correlation between the levels of FOSL2 mRNA and the microvessel biomarker CD31 was discerned from the analysis of bulk data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the results revealed a positive correlation between FOSL2 mRNA expression and CD31 expression (Figure 1I). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found that the FOSL2-regulated gene signature was positively correlated with the enrichment of angiogenesis-related gene signaling (Figure 1J, and Figure S1F). Collectively, these data indicate that FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts potentially affects angiogenesis in breast tumors.Enhanced FOSL2 in CAFs contributes to breast tumor angiogenesisTo examine the role of FOSL2 in angiogenic behavior, we successfully established endogenous FOSL2 stably knocked down CAFs (CAFs/shFOSL2) and ectopic FOSL2 stably expressed NFs (NFs/FOSL2), which were confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2A-B). Ectopic FOSL2 in NFs or FOSL2 silencing in CAFs led to activation of NFs or inactivation of CAFs, as identified by \u03b1-SMA (Figure S2A). By employing a coculture system including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs or NFs, we observed a significant decrease in the invasion potential of HUVECs and the cumulative number of tubes in the coculture group treated with supernatant derived from FOSL2-silenced CAFs compared with the group treated with supernatant derived from the control CAFs (Figure 2C, top panels; Figure 2D-E). To better mimic in vivo blood vessel formation, we conducted HUVEC spheroid sprouting assays in 3D culture. The results showed that the cumulative sprout length (CSL) was significantly shorter in the system group treated with supernatant from FOSL2-knockdown CAFs than in the control group (Figure 2C, top panels; Figure 2F). In contrast, the invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting abilities of HUVECs were dramatically enhanced by CM from FOSL2-overexpressing NFs (Figure 2C, bottom panels; Figure 2D-F). To adequately understand the pro-angiogenic functions of the CM derived from the engineered CAFs or NFs, we evaluated the different types of vectors on the cell proliferation of CAFs or NFs and the protein concentrations in the medium at the terminal time point of the experiment. The proliferation of CAFs or NFs was not significantly influenced by FOSL2 expression (Figure S2B). The protein concentrations between NFs and CAFs in FBS-free medium or in 10% FBS-containing growth medium also had no significant differences at the terminal time point of CM (Figure S2C-D), indicating that the pro-angiogenic behavior of CM was just induced by FOSL2 levels in CAFs or NFs. Previous studies revealed that FOSL2 was abundantly expressed in breast tumor cells. The effect of CM derived from CAFs or NFs on tumor cells was evaluated. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 breast cancer cells cocultured with CM from FOSL2-silenced CAFs had reduced proliferation (Figure S2E-F) and invasive ability (Figure S2G-I) in comparison with CM from control CAFs. In contrast, the proliferation (Figure S2E-F) and invasion (Figure S2G-I) abilities of breast tumor cells were increased by CM from FOSL2-overexpressing NFs. Taken together, these results suggest that FOSL2 in breast CAFs plays a positive role in angiogenesis.FOSL2 promotes CAF angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent mannerAmong the known angiogenic regulators, VEGFA is a key mediator. We thus evaluated whether FOSL2 can regulate VEGFA expression in breast CAFs. Loss of endogenous FOSL2 in CAFs or transduction of ectopic FOSL2 into NFs had almost no effect on VEGF expression (Figure 3A, and Figure S3A). Consistently, FOSL2 expression was found to be extremely limited in association with VEGFA levels analyzed using TCGA database (Figure S3B, r=0.17, p<0.001). Concomitantly, knockdown of FOSL2 in CAFs or overexpression of ectopic FOSL2 in NFs had no effect on VEGFA secretion in the supernatants derived from these engineered fibroblasts and the corresponding control cells (Figure 3B). Indeed, CM derived from CAFs or ectopic FOSL2-expressing NFs maintained the ability to promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs in the presence of anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 3C-F) or axitinib (an inhibitor of VEGFR) (Figure S3C-F). These data suggest a VEGF-independent proangiogenic function of FOSL2 in CAFs.FOSL2 is regulated by estrogen/cAMP/PKA signalingThe mammary gland is a complex organ that undergoes hormonally regulated changes. CAFs are the major cell type in stroma that converts androgens into estrogen by aromatase, a critical, rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of estrogen in the breast cancer microenvironment. As expected, the mRNA level of aromatase (CYP19A1) (Figure 4A and Figure S4A) and the amount of synthesized estrogen (E2) were notably higher in CAFs than in NFs (Figure 4B). Our previous study found that E2 could efficiently activate downstream signaling through the cAMP/PKA axis in breast stromal fibroblasts. Indeed, more intracellular cAMP production was detected in CAFs or in NFs treated with E2 (Figure 4C). We asked whether FOSL2 expression could be regulated by the estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in CAFs. Astoundingly, the increased FOSL2 levels in immortalized or primary CAFs were notably reduced by SQ22536 (a cAMP inhibitor) (Figure 4D, and Figure S4B) and H89 (a PKA inhibitor) (Figure 4E, and Figure S4C); conversely, a higher level of FOSL2 was detected in immortalized or primary NFs stimulated by E2 (Figure 4F, and Figure S4D). Furthermore, efficient knockdown of CYP19A1 in CAFs (Figure 4G) led to decreased FOSL2 (Figure 4H-I). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the local estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in breast CAFs is involved in regulating FOSL2 expression.FOSL2 transcriptionally activates Wnt5a and leads to increased Wnt5a secretion from CAFsTo further explore the functions of stromal FOSL2 in regulating angiogenesis, we identified target genes of FOSL2 by merging the data acquired from targets predicted by the Cistrome database (http://cistrome.org/db/) with the potential genes associated with angiogenesis and secretion of extracellular proteins from the AmiGO database (http://amigo.geneontology.org/). Sixty-eight candidates that may be regulated by FOSL2 and related to angiogenesis were identified (Figure 5A). After comparison with our mRNA expression profile of CAFs/NFs, 14 candidate genes were aberrantly expressed in breast CAFs (Figure 5B). Using a protein network analysis, we found that Wnt5a was in the core of the network among these potential transcriptional targets of FOSL2, indicating that Wnt5a is a major candidate target of FOSL2 (Figure S5A). In accordance with this finding and our previous RNA-sequencing data of CAFs/NFs, Wnt5a was markedly upregulated in breast tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumor tissues using a public database including 1085 cases of tumors and 291 cases of normal tissues (Figure S5B), suggesting increased Wnt5a in the tumor stroma. Further analysis proved that Wnt5a was significantly changed at the mRNA and protein levels in FOSL2-knockdown CAFs or FOSL2-overexpressing NFs (Figure 5C-D). To further understand whether Wnt5a is a direct transcriptional target of FOSL2, a bioinformatics analysis and sets of experiments were carried out. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there were three potential FOSL2 binding consensus sequences (E1, E2 and E3) in the Wnt5a promoter (Figure 5E). Checked by luciferase reporter assay, we found that the reporter containing E2 (Figure 5E) had high transcriptional activity (Figure 5F, upper panel), and mutation of the E2 motif (Figure 5E) notably decreased luciferase activity (Figure 5F, down panel), which was further confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 5G), suggesting that consensus E2 is essential for FOSL2-mediated transcriptional activity of Wnt5a. Consistently, more Wnt5a-secreting CAFs were detected than NFs, and the concentration of Wnt5a secreted in the supernatant was significantly reduced in FOSL2-knockdown CAFs compared with that in control CAFs. Conversely, there was increased Wnt5a secretion in FOSL2-overexpressing NFs compared with that in control NFs (Figure 5H). These data demonstrate that FOSL2 can directly regulate Wnt5a expression.Wnt5a plays an essential role in the FOSL2-mediated promotion of angiogenesis in CAFsTo investigate the pro-angiogenic role of Wnt5a in breast CAFs, we transfected a retrovirus-mediated shRNA specifically against Wnt5a in CAFs and an ectopic Wnt5a construct into NFs. Wnt5a overexpression in NFs (NF/Wnt5a) or loss of endogenous Wnt5a in CAFs (CAFs/shWnt5a) resulted in marked changes in the invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting abilities of HUVECs (Figure S5C), indicating that Wnt5a, as a downstream target of FOSL2, is essential for CAF-promoting angiogenesis function. Next, we examined the Wnt5a-dependent angiogenesis role of FOSL2 in CAFs. Treatment of HUVECs with supernatant derived from FOSL2-silenced CAFs reduced the cell invasion (Figure 6A, upper panels; Figure 6B, left panel), tube formation (Figure 6C, upper panels; Figure 6D, left panel) and spheroid sprouting (Figure 6E, upper panels; Figure 6F, left panel) potential of HUVECs. The addition of rWnt5a into the supernatant from FOSL2-silenced CAFs rescued the cell invasion, tube formation and spheroid sprouting potential of HUVECs, which resulted from the loss of FOSL2 in CAFs (Figure 6A-F). In contrast, the promoting effects on cell invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting of HUVECs were observed in CM derived from ectopic FOSL2 NFs and mitigated by treatment of the CM with BOX5, a Wnt5a antagonist (Figure 6A, 6C and 6E, down panels; Figure 6B, 6D and 6F, right panels). Thus, this evidence supports the Wnt5a-dependent angiogenesis role of stromal FOSL2 in breast cancer.Wnt5a derived from CAFs activates FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling in endothelial cellsWnt5a can induce signal transduction in target cells by binding to its receptors, the Frizzled family (FZDs), a cysteine-rich seven transmembrane receptor family. We asked whether CAF-derived Wnt5a could bind to FZD5, a potential member of the Frizzled family in HUVECs, and stimulate possible downstream signaling pathways. Efficient knockdown of FZD5 in HUVECs (Figure 7A) abolished the cell invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs even in the presence of rWnt5a (Figure 7B-D), suggesting that FZD5 is necessary for Wnt5a in angiogenesis. Several signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, ERK and AKT, are potential downstream signaling pathways of FZDs; thus, the activation of NF-\u03baB, ERK and AKT signaling in HUVECs was examined. As shown in Figure 7E, loss of FOSL2 or Wnt5a in CAFs significantly quenched the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK in HUVECs stimulated by CAF CM. Similarly, loss of FZD5 in HUVECs rendered NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling unable to respond to CAF CM, and addition of rWnt5a in FBS-free medium directly activated these signaling pathways in HUVECs (Figure 7E-F). However, the activation of VEGFR2 was not affected by silencing FOSL2, Wnt5a, or FZD5 or by exogenous supplementation with rWnt5a. Meanwhile, Wnt5a, as a representative member of the noncanonical Wnt proteins, has been reported to play dual roles in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. We found that Wnt5a could stimulate the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in HUVECs (Figure 7F) and thereby promote angiogenesis. These data demonstrate that the Wnt5a/FZD5 axis stimulates the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling in HUVECs.CAFs promote breast tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner to fuel breast tumor growth in vivoTo further investigate the proangiogenesis function of the FOSL2/Wnt5a signaling axis in vivo, a mixture of the indicated cells was subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Compared with the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with FOSL2-silenced CAFs had fewer blood vessels on the tumor surface and less CD31 staining in tumor tissue; the tumor burden mice injected with a mixture of MDA-MB-231 and FOSL2-overexpressing NFs had more blood vessels and a large tumor size (Figure 8A and Figure S6A). To confirm the number differences of blood vessels attributing to angiogenesis, the mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (CDH5), a strictly endothelial marker, and prosperohomeobox protein1 (prox1), a biomarker for lymphatic endothelial cells were detected in the tumor samples (Figure S6B). The high level of VE-cadherin closely related with microvessel density based on CD31 staining rather than prox1 expression. In contrast to blockage of VEGF signaling alone by anti-VEGF antibody, FOSL2 knockdown in CAFs combined with VEGF signaling inhibitors could augment the suppressive efficiencies to tumor angiogenesis, indicating that FOSL2 acted as an obviously proangiogenic effector in the VEGF-independent pathway. Consistently, treating mice with Wnt5a, the critical pro-angiogenic factor regulated by FOSL2, could partly rescue blood vessels and tumor growth of tumor burden mice injected with FOSL2-silenced CAFs (labeled CAF/shFOSL2 + rWnt5a) in comparison to their control tumors (labeled CAF/shFOSL2). The tumor burden mice injected with NFs had fewer blood vessels and small tumors, and ectopic FOSL2 in NFs could significantly promote blood vessels and tumor growth. However, treatment of tumor burden mice injected with FOSL2-overexpressing NFs using BOX5 (Wnt5a antagonist) mitigated FOSL2-stimulated blood vessels and tumor growth (Figure 8B-C and Figure S6C). In addition, we found that knockdown of FOSL2 in CAFs could increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to VEGF inhibitors in vivo (Figure 8A-C, Figure S6A-C). Similarly, loss of Wnt5a, the direct target of FOSL2, in CAFs significantly decreased tumor blood vessel formation and tumor growth (Figure S6D-F). To further evaluate the clinical value of FOSL2-regulated Wnt5a involved in angiogenesis, we detected secreted Wnt5a levels in serum from 71 breast cancer patients and Wnt5a levels in corresponding tumor tissues or secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of primary stromal fibroblasts isolated from 12 pairs of nontumor and tumor samples and the corresponding FOSL2 expression and vessel density of tumors. High levels of secreted Wnt5a were detected in patient serum, and enhanced serum Wnt5a was positively correlated with microvessel density in breast tumors (Figure 8D). The FOSL2 protein levels in tumor tissues were closely related to the Wnt5a concentration in tumor extracts (Figure 8E). Moreover, the FOSL2 levels in primary stromal CAFs were much higher than those in the corresponding primary NFs, and the enhanced stromal FOSL2 was almost correlated with a high concentration of secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of CAFs (Figure 8F and S6G), confirming that FOSL2-regulated Wnt5a in stromal CAFs was close to clinical angiogenesis. Collectively, the current study reveals a novel function of breast CAFs. The increased FOSL2 in CAFs plays a pivotal role in promoting angiogenesis by regulating Wnt5a, thus stimulating activation of the downstream FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling axis in vascular endothelial cells to fuel tumor angiogenesis VEGF-independent patterns.DiscussionThe identification of angiogenesis as a prerequisite for the outgrowth of solid tumors boosts the field of angiogenesis research. However, enthusiasm for angiostatic therapy has been hampered due to the limited beneficial effect of these anti-angiogenesis agents on patient survival, especially in breast cancers. The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been considered to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. In particular, CAFs are gradually viewed as the chief architects of the TME due to their multiple functions, including tumor angiogenesis with intimate crosstalk between endothelial cells. In this study, we identified that the transcriptional factor FOSL2 may act as a novel tumor angiogenesis target in breast CAFs. The enhanced FOSL2 in breast CAFs was induced by endogenous aromatase through the E2/cAMP/PKA pathway. Furthermore, the activated CAFs induced by FOSL2 could not promote VEGF but could promote Wnt5a expression, which stimulated angiogenesis through FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling, even under the blockage of classical VEGF signaling by anti-VEGF antibody and axitinib. Collectively, the current study suggests that targeting FOSL2 in stromal CAFs may be an effective alternative to overcome tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF signaling treatment.Transcription factors (TFs) coordinate the expression of target genes typically through cis-regulatory DNA elements. A small set of lineage-specific master TFs dictate the core transcriptional programs governing cell identity and malignant state. Elucidating the core transcriptional regulatory mechanisms is necessary to understand the fundamentals of molecular carcinogenesis. A more recent study has revealed that stomach and intestinal lineage-specific programs are reactivated in Sox2high/Sox9high and Cdx2high cancers by comparing the gastrointestinal lineage-specific transcriptome to human gastrointestinal cancer data, which highlights the importance of developmental lineage programs reactivated by gastrointestinal TFs in cancer. Strikingly, a novel study has determined that TFs of the FOS family are significantly variable for single E18 fetal mouse mammary cells when compared with the permutated background, suggesting that these factors may contribute to cellular differentiation programs. Herein, we found that FOSL2 was upregulated in activated CAFs of breast cancers. The links between FOSL2-mediated breast development and breast tumor angiogenesis suggest that targeting FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts may have significant value for breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, we found that FOSL2 was downregulated in preeclampsia (PE) by analyzing the transcriptome of PE, which was ascribed to decreased angiogenesis signaling. These works support our findings that FOSL2 in breast CAFs plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.The role of CAFs in tumor angiogenesis architecture is increasingly dominant in breast tissues. The focus of our study on breast CAFs in angiogenesis is promising. Recently, in an MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer, the issue of heterogeneity of CAFs was distinguished by the global gene expression profile using single-cell RNA sequencing. Of note, there are three subtypes of mouse CAFs, including vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs), that are significantly enriched by gene ontology (GO) sets. The vCAF signatures, close to vascular development and angiogenesis, are highly conserved in patient samples of breast tumors. Therefore, antagonizing CAFs as an antiangiogenic treatment modality for breast cancer opens the possibility for biomarker-driven development of drugs for precision therapy.Stromal CAF populations, which engage in pleiotropic processes in tumor angiogenesis, are pivotal to the resistance of VEGF blockade. It has been shown that resistance to antiangiotherapy is partly involved in angio-stimulatory growth factor redundancy and multiplicity. In a seminal paper, compression-induced expression of glycolysis genes in CAFs correlates with angiogenesis gene expression in breast cancer. Tumor-induced compression might inevitably be a sustained driver for angiogenesis-related gene expression to cause the redundancy of angiogenesis growth factors. Meanwhile, tumor angiogenesis can become VEGF independent at a more advanced stage because of the production of other proangiogenesis molecules and thus respond poorly to VEGF blockade. The release of multiple angiogenesis factors, such as SDF-1 and PDGF-C, by CAFs contributes to resistance. Our studies support that, likewise, although VEGFA is considerably expressed in breast CAFs, FOSL2 is one of the key players in promoting angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner. FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts promotes angiogenesis by inducing Wnt5a transcription.Aberrant Wnt5a signaling is an important event in tumor progression, with oncogenic or tumor-suppressing effects dependent on tumor types. In breast cancer, the respectable evidence supports that Wnt5a has oncogenic activity. For example, elevated Wnt5a was detected in basal-like breast cancer cells at both the mRNA and protein levels, and loss of Wnt5a could efficiently inhibit tumor growth in SUM1315 cells in vivo . In addition, GLIS1, a novel hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, was reported to increase the migration and invasion capacities of breast cancer cells by upregulating Wnt5a, and Wnt5a levels were associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Notably, several studies reported that Wnt5a was highly expressed in breast stromal cells and associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. For example, enhanced Wnt5a was proven in breast tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which induced invasiveness of breast cancer cells and production of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in macrophages. A whole-transcriptome analysis of selectively retrieved engulfing breast cancer cells identified a gene signature of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) engulfment consisting of Wnt5a, which enhanced distant metastasis. Another study revealed that Wnt5a in breast CAFs was significantly downregulated after 1,25D (1alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) treatment, in which 1,25D elicited obvious tumor suppressive effects. In addition, the role of Wnt5a is emerging in the promotion of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, Wnt5a signaling has been found to be required for the pathological angiogenesis. In a study, the reduced vascularization of matrigel plugs in conditional deletion of the Wnt secretion factor Evi in mouse ECs (Evi-ECKO) could be rescued by introduction of non-canonical Wnt5a. The release of Wnt5a from infiltrating monocytes is especially important to drive angiogenesis in inflamed vessels. In addition, Wnt5a has been disclosed to play essential role in tumor angiogenesis, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. However, whether Wnt5a derived from stromal cell acting a role in angiogenesis has poor understanding. In one research, CD163 positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) may induce angiogenesis via crosstalk with malignant epithelial cells to promote Wnt5a expression. Here, we confirmed that the increased stromal Wnt5a plays a crucial role in VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast cancer. Our findings provide important evidence for its oncogenic role in the breast tumor microenvironment, which suggests that targeting Wnt5a in the breast TME may provide a potential option for antiangiogenesis therapy in breast cancer.Together, our study supports the notion that stromal CAFs promote VEGF-independent pro-angiogenesis processes in breast cancer, and FOSL2-mediated Wnt5a expression and activation of downstream signaling are crucial for VEGF-independent angiogenesis of breast CAFs. The elucidation of reciprocal interactions of breast CAFs with endothelial cells may inspire the development of conceptually novel targeted therapeutics with the aim of thwarting the FOSL2/Wnt5a axis of breast tumor angiogenesis.Supplementary MaterialTumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implicationsVEGF in Signaling and Disease: Beyond Discovery and DevelopmentResistance and escape from

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes.

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "title": "Breast carcinoma cell uptake and biodistribution of technetium-99m-carboxymethyl benzylamide dextran.",
        "content": "Carboxymethyl Benzylamide Dextran (CMDB7) displayed an in vitro growth inhibitory activity on breast tumor cells. CMDB7 is able to disrupt the interaction of angiogenic growth factors (FGF2, TGF beta and PDGF) with their membrane receptors. This compound blocks the angiogenesis of MDA-MB435 carcinoma xenografted in mammary fat pad and their lung metastases in nude mice. In this work, we studied the uptake of CMDB7 labeled with 99mTc in cultured human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line and the highly tumorigenic MCF-7ras cell line (Ha-ras-transfected MCF-7 cells) and the in vivo distribution in MCF-7ras tumor-bearing mice. The 99mTc-CMDB7 are stable and the intracellular concentration is time-dependent and reaches a plateau at 180 minutes. 99mTc CMDB7 uptake is much higher in MCF-7ras cells than MCF-7 cells. Since CMDB7 is internalized and could also inhibit cell proliferation by acting at nuclear sites, we investigated the MCF-7ras nuclear localization after cell fractionation. Cell fractionation revealed a cytoplasmic and nuclear internalization of CMDB7. The tumor uptakes of 99mTc-CMDB7 were 0.34%, 0.72% and 0.62% of the administrated doses per gram of tumor tissue at 1 hour, 3 hour and 5 hours respectively after their injection. The blood clearance of 99mTc CMDB7 was very rapid and the liver, spleen and kidney uptakes were very weak. These results confirm the absence of toxicity of CMDB7 and the usefulness of CMDB7 in cancer therapy by targeting breast tumors.",

Cancer Lett 434: 1-10, 2018]. In addition, there were potentially anomalous features associated with the western blot and cell cycle data in this paper.In view of the fact that certain of the data in the above article were also submitted to a different journal within the space of a few days, the Editor of International Journal of Oncology has decided that this paper should be retracted from the publication.

        "title": "Human breast cancer associated fibroblasts exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles.",
        "content": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease for which prognosis and treatment strategies are largely governed by the receptor status (estrogen, progesterone and Her2) of the tumor cells. Gene expression profiling of whole breast tumors further stratifies breast cancer into several molecular subtypes which also co-segregate with the receptor status of the tumor cells. We postulated that cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor stroma may exhibit subtype specific gene expression profiles and thus contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype specific manner. Several studies have reported gene expression profile differences between CAFs and normal breast fibroblasts but in none of these studies were the results stratified based on tumor subtypes. To address whether gene expression in breast cancer associated fibroblasts varies between breast cancer subtypes, we compared the gene expression profiles of early passage primary CAFs isolated from twenty human breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes; seven ER+, seven triple negative (TNBC) and six Her2+. We observed significant expression differences between CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer and CAFs from TNBC and ER + cancers, particularly in pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer. These data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.",

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast.

SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min. Upper panels, representative images of adherent cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panel, adhesion was quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm). Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay. Left panels, representative images of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 wound healing over time (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a016\u2009h) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm. Right panel, wound healing (wound width, in \u03bcm) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) was quantified over time. The data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment. (D) Cell invasion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroids embedded in collagen I gel were let to invade in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 3\u2009days. Left panels, representative images of invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Right panel, the invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell area was quantified using Image J. Data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test).DISCUSSIONHere, we showed that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed in both tumor and stromal cells, and that its expression in CAFs independently predicts RFS in patients with TNBC. Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "content": "Nanoparticle penetration through tumor tissue after extravasation is considered as a key issue for tumor distribution and therapeutic effects. Most tumors possess abundant stroma, a fibrotic tissue composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which acts as a barrier for nanoparticle penetration. There is however a lack of suitable in vitro systems to study the tumor stroma penetration of nanoparticles. In the present study, we developed and thoroughly characterized a 3D co-culture spheroidal array to mimic tumor stroma and investigated the penetration of silica and PLGA nanoparticles in these spheroids. First, we examined human breast tumor patient biopsies to characterize the content and organization of stroma and found a high expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA; 40% positive area) and collagen-1 (50% positive area). Next, we prepared homospheroids of 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells or 3T3 mouse fibroblasts alone as well as heterospheroids combining 3T3 and 4T1 cells in different ratios (1:1 and 5:1) using a microwell array platform. Confocal live imaging revealed that fibroblasts distributed and reorganized within 48h in heterospheroids. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining and gene expression analysis showed a proportional increase of \u03b1-SMA and collagen in heterospheroids with higher fibroblast ratios attaining 35% and 45% positive area at 5:1 (3T3:4T1) ratio, in a good match with the clinical breast tumor stroma. Subsequently, we studied the penetration of high and low negatively charged fluorescent silica nanoparticles (30nm; red and 100 or 70nm; green; zeta potential: -40mV and -20mV) and as well as Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles (200nm, -7mV) in both homo- and heterospheroid models. Fluorescent microscopy on spheroid cryosections after incubation with silica nanoparticles showed that 4T1 homospheroids allowed a high penetration of about 75-80% within 24h, with higher penetration in case of the 30nm nanoparticles. In contrast, spheroids with increasing fibroblast amounts significantly inhibited NP penetration. Silica nanoparticles with a less negative zeta potential exhibited lesser penetration compared to highly negative charged nanoparticles. Subsequently, similar experiments were conducted using Cy5-conjugated pegylated PLGA nanoparticles and confocal laser scanning microscopy; an increased nanoparticle penetration was found in 4T1 homospheroids until 48h, but significantly lower penetration in heterospheroids. Furthermore, we also developed human homospheroids (MDA-MB-231 or Panc-1 tumor cells) and heterospheroids (MDA-MB-231/BJ-hTert and Panc-1/pancreatic stellate cells) and performed silica nanoparticle (30 and 100nm) penetration studies. As a result, heterospheroids had significantly a lesser penetration of the nanoparticles compared to homospheroids. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that tumor stroma acts as a strong barrier for nanoparticle penetration. The 30-nm nanoparticles with low zeta potential favor deeper penetration. Furthermore, the herein proposed 3D co-culture platform that mimics the tumor stroma, is ideally suited to systematically investigate the factors influencing the penetration characteristics of newly developed nanomedicines to allow the design of nanoparticles with optimal penetration characteristics.",

IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

        "title": "Experimental generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts.",
        "content": "Carcinomas are complex tissues comprised of neoplastic cells and a non-cancerous compartment referred to as the 'stroma'. The stroma consists of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a variety of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes and leukocytes (1-3). The tumour-associated stroma is responsive to substantial paracrine signals released by neighbouring carcinoma cells. During the disease process, the stroma often becomes populated by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) including large numbers of myofibroblasts. These cells have previously been extracted from many different types of human carcinomas for their in vitro culture. A subpopulation of CAFs is distinguishable through their up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression(4,5). These cells are a hallmark of 'activated fibroblasts' that share similar properties with myofibroblasts commonly observed in injured and fibrotic tissues (6). The presence of this myofibroblastic CAF subset is highly related to high-grade malignancies and associated with poor prognoses in patients. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that CAFs, when injected with carcinoma cells into immunodeficient mice, are capable of substantially promoting tumourigenesis (7-10). CAFs prepared from carcinoma patients, however, frequently undergo senescence during propagation in culture limiting the extensiveness of their use throughout ongoing experimentation. To overcome this difficulty, we developed a novel technique to experimentally generate immortalised human mammary CAF cell lines (exp-CAFs) from human mammary fibroblasts, using a coimplantation breast tumour xenograft model. In order to generate exp-CAFs, parental human mammary fibroblasts, obtained from the reduction mammoplasty tissue, were first immortalised with hTERT, the catalytic subunit of the telomerase holoenzyme, and engineered to express GFP and a puromycin resistance gene. These cells were coimplanted with MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells expressing an activated ras oncogene (MCF-7-ras cells) into a mouse xenograft. After a period of incubation in vivo, the initially injected human mammary fibroblasts were extracted from the tumour xenografts on the basis of their puromycin resistance (11). We observed that the resident human mammary fibroblasts have differentiated, adopting a myofibroblastic phenotype and acquired tumour-promoting properties during the course of tumour progression. Importantly, these cells, defined as exp-CAFs, closely mimic the tumour-promoting myofibroblastic phenotype of CAFs isolated from breast carcinomas dissected from patients. Our tumour xenograft-derived exp-CAFs therefore provide an effective model to study the biology of CAFs in human breast carcinomas. The described protocol may also be extended for generating and characterising various CAF populations derived from other types of human carcinomas.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "Angiogenesis is a significant prognostic factor in breast cancer, but the factors that control angiogenesis in vivo are not well defined. Multiple angiogenic polypeptides are known, and we have determined the expression of seven of these in primary human breast cancers; the relationship of expression to estrogen receptor and vascular density was also examined. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its four isoforms (121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, pleiotrophin, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF), placental growth factor, and thymidine phosphorylase (platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor) were quantitated by RNase protection analysis. beta-FGF was also measured by ELISA. The estrogen receptor (ER), epidermal growth factor receptor, and vascular density were analyzed in 64 primary breast cancers. All tumors expressed at least six different vascular growth factors. VEGF was most abundant, and the transcript for the 121-amino acid form predominated. Other angiogenic factors expressed at high levels were thymidine phosphorylase and TGF-beta1. Expression of most of the angiogenic factors did not correlate with that of ER or vascular density. However, thymidine phosphorylase did, with a correlation coefficient of 0.3 (P = 0.03). There were significant associations of pleiotrophin with acidic FGF expression (P = 0.001) and TGF-beta with platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor expression (P = 0.001). Thus, angiogenesis may involve a coordinate regulation of some vascular growth factors. High VEGF expression correlated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis (P = 0.03), as did ER and epidermal growth factor receptor expression. Basic FGF was also assessed by ELISA and was more highly expressed in tumors than normal breast tissues (median, 346 microg/ml cytosol; range, 54-1323 versus median, 149; range, 32-509; P = 0.01). Implications for therapy are that broad spectrum agents that block features common to these factors may be useful (e.g., antagonism of heparin-binding activity agents), because so many angiogenic factors are expressed. Inhibiting endothelial migration or agents directly toxic to endothelium would be of value in a combined approach to therapy.",

        "full_text": "Open-source automated centrifugal pump test rigGraphical abstractDesign methods for large industrial pumps are well developed, but they cannot be relied upon when designing specialised miniature pumps, due to scaling issues. Therefore, the design and development phase of small pumps demand numerous experimental tests to ensure a viable prototype. Of initial interest is hydraulic design in the form of pump performance and efficiency curves. This project aimed to produce an automated test rig capable of generating both the performance (P-Q \u2013 pressure vs. flow rate) and efficiency curves that are reliable and repeatable. The apparatus is largely customizable and suitable for a range of smaller pump sizes. The pump impeller and volute were 3D printed, allowing for design flexibility and rapid prototyping and testing.The test loop was automated which allowed the flow rate to be incremented from 0\u00a0L/min to the maximum flow rate. At each step the pressure, flow rate, voltage and current were recorded to generate the P \u2013 Q and efficiency curves. Repeatability results showed low variations of \u00b13\u00a0mmHg (400\u00a0Pa) in pressure and\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% in hydraulic efficiency. The given setup can be used to compare and evaluate the hydraulic performance of various pump designs.IntroductionSpecifications tableHardware name\tOpen-Source Automated Centrifugal Pump Test Rig\t \tSubject area\tFluid DynamicsMechanical EngineeringGeneral\t \tHardware type\tFluidic HandlingElectrical engineeringMechanical engineering\t \tOpen Source License\tCC by 4.0\t \tCost of Hardware\t$ 4 160\t \tSource File Repository\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tHardware in contextWhen developing pumps, it is common to follow traditional pump design theory such as the methodology proposed by Stepanoff in 1948. Traditional pump theories rely on design constants derived for industrial pumping applications, which presents scaling down issues when applied to much smaller pumps, leading to a less than optimal design. The performance characteristics are typically improved upon through a building-and-testing approach as there is no pure theoretical or analytical solution to determine the hydraulic performance of pumps. Therefore, the optimisation of small pumps must be performed experimentally and iteratively.A number of design variables influence the performance of pumps. Generally considered the single most important component is the impeller. Design variations of the impeller can include altering the impeller diameter, blade angles, blade heights and the number of blades. The coupling between the impeller and volute are also highly influential. The volute design is largely dictated by the \u2018spiral\u2019 shape, affecting the pressure and velocity of the collecting flow leaving the impeller. Another interaction that has significant impact on performance is the axial clearance. This represents the gap between the top of the impeller blades and the pump housing, influencing the flow leakage over the impeller blades; the pressure generated and pump efficiency are highly sensitive to this clearance. The presented test rig accommodates for the mentioned variables, resulting in a large number of design variations.The two measures of primary importance for characterizing the performance of these pumps are the P\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Q (pressure vs. flow rate) curves and efficiency curves. The pressure used in the P \u2013 Q curves is defined as the static pressure difference between the outlet and inlet pump terminals. The ideal design or operating point for a pump should coincide with the best efficiency point. The presented hardware was used to evaluate blood pump designs where the design point is typically concentrated around a pressure value of 100\u00a0mmHg and a flow rate of 5\u00a0L/min. In this application it is important to maximise the efficiency at this operating point.Hardware descriptionThe presented automated pump test rig was developed to assess the performance of various blood pump designs. The following sections give a brief description of the major components.Test loopTest loop main components.A simple test loop allows fluid to circulate through the pump while monitoring the pressure difference and flow rate. In order to generate the performance and efficiency curves the pressure, voltage and current are recorded at various flow rates (keeping constant pump speeds). The flow rate is manipulated using a PWM driven air regulator (ITV2030-312BS5, SMC, Tokyo, Japan) (not shown) to adjust a pneumatic pinch valve (Fig. 1). For each experiment the flow rate starts at 0\u00a0L/min and increases by 0.5\u00a0L/min every 75\u00a0s. This can be altered through the provided SimuLink file. The changing target flow signal was generated using Simulink (R2015a, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) code. It included a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, ensuring the flow rate reached and settled at the target flow, using the flow sensor as feedback, before incrementing to the next step. The working fluid consisted of a water \u2013 glycerol solution to approximate the fluid properties of blood.Test rigTest rig main components.Cut-away showing adjustment of the axial clearance.The test rig consists of a DC motor mounted to a linear rail system. The original front end plate was replaced with a custom plate that included a bearing to support the shaft (Fig. 2). Using a stepper motor to drive the ball screw, the position of the motor and shaft can be controlled, changing the axial clearance within the pump (Fig. 3).Pump assemblyPump assembly components.The pump assembly comprises four components: the pump base, volute, impeller and pump top (not shown). These components are all 3D printed which allows for rapid prototyping of various designs. The pump design is largely customisable with the only requirement being that the base feet are located in the slotted plate (Fig. 4) to centre the shaft in the volute.All 3D printing was performed in-house (Objet30 Prime, Stratasys, Rehovot, Israel) using VeroWhitePlus (RGD835, Stratasys, Rehovot, Israel) as the model material and SUP706 B (SUP706 B, Stratasys, Rehovot, Israel) as the support. It is understood that the 3D printed parts will bear a higher surface roughness than commercial pumps. Rougher surfaces will influence the pump losses and hence, impact the measured performance. The purpose of the automated test rig is to quickly identify the most promising prototype \u2013 each of which will have performance affected to the same degree and relative performance will be unaffected. To reduce the impact of surface roughness, all components were produced using the finest print settings and oriented to ensure the smoothest possible finish on key surfaces. The surface roughness (Sa) was measured to be 0.05\u00a0\u03bcm using a Zeta300 optical profilometer (KLA-Tencor, Milpitas, CA, USA). The influence of surface roughness is expected to me minimal compared to the contribution of other experimental factors.Control boxControl box components.A touch screen is utilized to allow on-the-fly manipulation of the pump speed and positioning of the motor assembly on the linear rail system (Fig. 5). The control box makes use of an Arduino Due (Arduino Due R3, Arduino SRL, Scarmagno, Italy) incorporating programming for a PID controller to accurately set and maintain the motor speed. The display outputs a readout showing the target and measured speed as well as the relative current position of the linear rail platform. The control box is responsible for sampling the voltage and current (signal output to the data acquisition system via an LM324N op amp) used by the motor for efficiency calculations. Component details are available in the Bill of Materials.Data acquisition \u2013 Control Desk / dSPACEIn this system a dSPACE (DS1104, dSPACE, Paderborn, Germany) data acquisition module was used to read all data signals (pressure, flow rate, voltage and current) and send the appropriate signal to the air regulator for pinch valve (flow rate) adjustment. The dSPACE system was used as it was readily available, however, any DAQ could perform these tasks. Control Desk is the program that gives the dSPACE a user interface. Some adjustment to the calibration and tuning built into the SimuLink code can be made from Control Desk. This includes the flow rate increments, timing and PID gains. The program provides real-time visualisation of the data and access to the controls necessary to setup/run the experiment.Design filesDesign files summaryDesign file name\tFile type\tOpen source license\tLocation of the file\t \tBase_Plate\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tBearing_Plate\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tMotor_Mount\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tSlotted_Plate\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tShaft\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tBase_Stand\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tBracket_Stand\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tCentre_Section\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tSlide_Section\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tBearing_Adapter\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tPump_Base\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tPump_Top\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tImpeller\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tVolute\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tSpacers\tCAD\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tWiring\tImage\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tSimuLink\tSimuLink\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tArduino\tArduino\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tMatLab\tMatLab script\tCC by 4.0\thttps://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/9T2Z6\t \tPump Test Rig \u2013 Contains the various machined components required to construct the test rig.

The tools required for assembly are commonly found in workshops and laboratories with the exception of a milling machine and laser cutter. The instructions outline those used to build the given setup with some simplified alternatives also suggested.Test rigAttach the bearing plate.The test rig is defined as the components used to drive the pump situated between the control box and pump assembly. Firstly, the aluminium sections (base plate, bearing plate, slotted plate, motor mount and shaft) should be machined according to the supplied CAD files.Attach the base plate to the linear rail system.Replacement of the original front plate with the bearing plate.Carefully remove the original front end plate of the linear rail system (Fig. 6) by removing the original M6 bolts. Press the 8\u00a0mm radial ball bearing into the recess that aligns with the ball screw on the bearing plate. Fix the bearing plate in place using the original M6 bolts.Attach the slotted plate to the base plate.a) Exploded view showing the base plate assembly, b) underside of linear rail system with t-nuts and c) assembled base plate photo.Orientate the base plate with the 4 countersunk holes towards the stepper motor. The rear of the base plate should be approximately flush with the stepper motor mount of the linear rail system. Align the aluminium extrusion t-nuts (Fig. 7b) with the countersunk holes in the base plate. Use the six M6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0mm bolts to secure the Base Plate to the linear rail system (Fig. 7a). Once assembled the base should lay flat from the countersunk holes (Fig. 7c).Attach the motor to the motor mount.Exploded view showing assembly of the slotted plate.Orientate the slotted plate with the four countersunk holes facing away from the base plate. Fix the slotted plate in place using the four M6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0mm bolts (Fig. 8). The front face of the base plate should be machined flat, allowing the slotted plate to be fixed at 90\u00b0 to the base.Fix the motor mount to the linear rail system.Exploded view showing motor mount assembly and photo of assembled components.Sit the DC motor in the cradle of the motor mount and slide forward until the front face of the motor meets the front plate of the motor mount. Rotate the motor to align the 4 fixing holes on the motor mount to those on the motor. Preferably, the hall effect sensor harness socket is facing upward for easy access. Fix in place using the four M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm bolts with M3 washers (Fig. 9).Insert bearings.a) Exploded view showing assembly of the motor mount to the linear rail system and b) photo of assembled motor mount and linear rail system.Sit the motor mount on the sliding platform of the linear rail system with the motor shaft facing the slotted plate. The holes in the motor mount base align with those on the sliding platform. Fix in place using the four M5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm bolts and M5 washers (Fig. 10). In this case use two washers to ensure that each bolt is secured firmly without interference. This could simply be avoided by using shorter bolts, however, were unavailable at the time of purchase.Attach motor couplingExploded view of bearing adapter assemblies and photo is assembled components.Press the self-aligning bearings into the 3D printed bearing adapters. Self-aligning bearings were utilised to accommodate any misalignment, to which the preliminary test results were very sensitive. The 3D printed adapters were used to allow for easy removal of the bearings for regular maintenance such as cleaning and lubrication due to their open-type nature. The adapters are pressed into the corresponding positions in the bearing plate and slotted plate in line with the motor shaft (Fig. 11).Assemble the shaft componentsDue to the lack of component availability at the time of construction, a small 3D printed sleeve (3\u00a0mm ID, 5\u00a0mm OD with an M3 grub screw hole) was required to fit the 5\u00a0mm cup joint to the 3\u00a0mm motor shaft. The sleeve is pressed into the cup joint and the grub screw lightly tightened to sit in the sleeve hole. This allows the coupling and sleeve to be pressed onto the motor shaft without the sleeve slipping. The grub screw is then fully tightened to fix the coupling.Attach pump basea) Exploded view showing the shaft component assembly and b) photos showing the shaft components assembled on either side of the bearing plate.Slide the shaft through the slotted plate and front bearing assembly with the roll pin hole end first. Before reaching the bearing plate, slide on one large shaft collar and one axial thrust bearing. The thrust bearing contains two washers \u2013 the housing and shaft washer. The shaft washer fits tightly against the shaft, whereas the housing washer has a larger bore, allowing the shaft to rotate. The housing washer should be the last component (against the bearing plate). This washer will remain stationary against the bearing plate while the shaft washer is free to rotate with the large collar and shaft. Push the shaft through the bearing assembly of the bearing plate. Feed onto the shaft the remaining thrust bearing and large collar. The washer order for this thrust bearing is not important since both will be rotating with the shaft, collar and self-aligning bearing. Next slide on the small shaft collar, this is used to measure the axial positioning of the shaft (described in the operating instructions). Tap the 2\u00a0mm roll pin through the hole in the shaft (Fig. 12a). Tighten the large shaft collars to sandwich the axial bearings against the bearing plate (Fig. 12b).a) Exploded view showing the pump base assembly and b) photo of the assembled pump base and impeller mount.Press the 5\u00a0mm shaft seal into the back of the 3D printed pump base with the wet side facing toward the pump assembly. Slide the pump base over the shaft via the seal and push into the slotted plate (Fig. 13a). In this case, align the pump base so that the notch is facing upward. This is done as the feet of the pump base are offset 0.3\u00a0mm to account for the misalignment from tolerance build up during assembly. This would be adjusted based on the measured misalignment. The compensation allows for the shaft to remain centred in the pump. Slide the 5\u00a0mm rigid flange coupling onto the D shape shaft end with the flange facing forward (Fig. 13b). This component will be used to mount the 3D printed impellers. Fix the impeller mount to the shaft using the M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm long grub screw on the shaft flat side and the M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0mm grub screw on the other. This allows the grub screws to secure the impeller mount against the shaft without the grub screws protruding, avoiding interference with the 3D printed pump base.The assembly of the pump components are outlined in the operation instructions.Control boxCut holes in the enclosureFix sockets and screenMark the positions of the three GX-16 sockets, two Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) connectors and DC power socket on the front (long side) of the electronics box. Ensure that the nut used to secure the sockets from the inside are not interfered with by internal structures. Drill holes the appropriate size for each socket at the marked locations. If necessary lightly file each hole to ensure a tight fit and remove any burrs. Position the touch screen on the lid located towards the left side, marking the location of the screen corners. Cut out a rectangle for the screen to fit tightly when pushed through from underneath. This can be achieved using a drill, small jigsaw and file. Position the heatsink, prototype board and stepper motor driver in the desired configuration (allow sufficient room between components) within the box and mark the positions for the standoffs. Drill these holes in the box floor for the M3 screws.Connect electronicsControl box socket configuration (left) and slot for Arduino access (right).Fix each of the sockets in the appropriate front holes, held in place with the securing nuts. Attach the screen to the lid using the four M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a016\u00a0mm bolts, four 4\u00a0mm nylon washers (used as standoffs) and four M3 nuts. With the Arduino and shield attached to the screen, mark on the left side of the electronics box, the position of the programming port. Cut this small section from the box to allow access to the Arduino when the box is assembled (Fig. 14).Control box electrical wiring diagram.Connect and solder the electronic components following the wiring diagram shown in Fig. 15 (a high resolution version is available in the supplied files). Use the power cable wire (AWG 18) for connections involving the 24\u00a0V power supply and connections to the motor due to the higher expected current and the hook-up wire (AWG 26) elsewhere. Use heat shrink where possible/appropriate to avoid shorts.Power to the motor is supplied directly from a 24\u00a0V laboratory power supply located externally to the control box. The motor speed is regulated by a PWM signal supplied by the Arduino via the N-channel MOSFET (Q1 in Fig. 15). The power supply is protected from parasitic back-EMF by D1. Signals from the motor\u2019s hall effect sensors are connected to hardware interrupt pins (18, 19) on the Arduino via voltage dividers (R1-4) which step the signal voltage down from 5\u00a0V to 3.3\u00a0V.The TB6560 stepper motor driver converts the logic level voltages supplied by the Arduino on the digital I/O pins (10, 12) to high current signals to drive the motor coils.Secure components \u2013 standoffsTwo operation amplifiers (op-amps) were configured as differential amplifiers (U2, U3) to convert the motor voltage and voltage across the current sense resistor to appropriate levels for the DAQ interface. The rail voltage of the op-amps was set at 12\u00a0V by the use of a linear voltage regulator (U1). This regulator also supplied the voltage to the Arduino via Vin.External wiringFeed ten Button M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0mm bolts from underneath the electrical box floor and attach the ten M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0mm standoffs (4 for the stepper motor driver, 4 for the prototype board and 2 for the voltage regulator heatsink). Position the stepper motor driver, prototype board and voltage regulator heatsink on the appropriate standoffs and secure in place using the remaining ten M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0mm bolts. Connect the 12\u00a0V voltage regulator to the regulator heat sink using the M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08\u00a0mm screw connected to the standoff and a small amount of thermal paste to ensure adequate heat transfer. Connect the MOSFET to the MOSFET heat sink using the M3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06\u00a0mm bolt. Over time the MOSFET would gradually heat up and required a small heatsink to ensure the component does not overheat.ProgrammingExternal wiring plug connections.Using a 1\u00a0m length of the power cable wire, connect the banana plugs to one end and the DC power plug to the other. Using the remainder of the power cable wire, solder each core to the power terminals of the motor. The order of which will influence the direction of motor rotation. The other end of the power cable is soldered to the 2 pin GX-16 plug. Cut the 4-core cable into 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0m lengths. For this setup, one length of cable is soldered to the 4 pin GX-16 plug at one end and to the hall effect sensor wire harness at the other. Although there are six wires on the harness, only encoder A, encoder B, sensor power and sensor ground are connected. The remaining 2 wires represent the motor power. These are already directly soldered to the terminals which are more suited to handle higher current. The unused wires from the harness are terminated using heat shrink to ensure they do not contact other equipment. The final section of 4 core cable is soldered to the 4 wires from the stepper motor. The other end is soldered to the 5 pin GX-16 plug. One pin will be unused. This was purposefully done to ensure that the plugs could not be accidentally inserted into the wrong sockets (Fig. 16).Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino Due using the Arduino IDE. The code may be manipulated to suit the desired application. The following will briefly cover the main aspects of the code.An introduction screen was coded to appear whenever the control box is connected to power. This simply requires a touch to change to the main operating screen. This extra touch means the motor cannot be (immediately) turned on accidentally.In order to accurately calculate the pump speed, the timer must be accurate. The internal timer, Timer 5 was accessed and used as the \u2018global counter\u2019 and set to 2.625\u00a0MHz by setting the appropriate prescalar (TIMER_CLOCK3) of 32. The global counter increased by 1 at the given frequency. Each time a signal was received from the hall effect sensor, the global counter was saved and compared to the previous value. From the difference between the values (counter difference), the known frequency of the counter and the number of hall effect pulses per revolution (11), the motor speed could be calculated.To reduce the impact of incorrect readings, two time-based comparator algorithms are utilised. The first compares the counter difference to the previous counter difference. If the value is outside the threshold, caused by either a missed pulse or an extra false pulse, it is discarded and the previous value remains. The second comparator backs up the first thus allowing the calculated speeds from both encoders to be compared. If the difference between the speeds exceeds a threshold, the speed is discarded and the previous remains, or else the two speeds are averaged. The second comparator block filters any false readings that may have occurred within the first compare threshold. Even though the motor is running at a constant speed, the speed readings may fluctuate due to any unequal positioning of the magnet segments during motor manufacturing. A running average is used to calculate the average speed over 10 rotations (110 pulses).The calculated speed is used as feedback for the PID controller. The gains were tuned as outlined in section 7.4. The controller would adjust the speed by varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal. To allow for fine speed adjustments, the analogue resolution was set to 12 bit.Apart from adjusting the motor speed, the touch screen is also used to change the position of the motor mount by controlling the stepper motor. Using the 1204 ball screw, the number of steps were set for each touch to result in 10\u00a0\u03bcm of movement. By selecting the bottom left of the screen, the step size can be changed to 1\u00a0mm movement steps for coarse adjustment.Test loopReservoirLoopPhotos of assembled reservoir showing the internal (top) and external (bottom) components.Cut the PVC pipe to a length of approximately 250\u00a0mm. Prime and glue the PVC cap on one end, forming the bottom of the reservoir. Drill two 20\u00a0mm diameter holes, 55\u00a0mm and 95\u00a0mm from the base, 90\u00b0 apart (with the higher hole in a clockwise position relative to the lower). Slide the 18\u00a0mm o-ring over the \u00be\u201d nipple and push through the drilled hole. The o-ring acts as a gasket on the outside of the reservoir. On the inside place the \u00be\u201d tank gasket (from the tank outlet) over the nipple and secure in place using the brass flange nut (top of Fig. 17). This should be tightened sufficiently to force the gasket against the inside of the pipe and the o-ring is compressed between the outside of the pipe and hex section of the nipple to ensure an adequate seal. The 20\u00a0mm ball valve is screwed onto the exposed nipple. To finalise the reservoir assembly, the 20 \u2013 13\u00a0mm threaded to barbed connectors are wound into the free end of the ball valve (bottom of Fig. 17). Thread tape is encouraged on all threaded surfaces to assist with sealing.StandsTest loop circuit showing tubing lengths.Screw the 25\u201313\u00a0mm barbed connectors to each end of the pinch valve. Connect the lengths of tubing and Luer lock connectors to the reservoir and pinch valve as presented in Fig. 18. The lengths of tubing were selected so the inlet and outlet pressure sensors were positioned 125\u00a0mm from the impeller inlet and diffuser respectively. The distance equates to 10 tubing diameters to ensure that a steady velocity profile is reached, resulting in accurate pressure readings. The same principle was applied to the distance between the flow sensor and reservoir outlet hole. A 3-way tap is attached to each Luer connector and represent the pressure sampling ports. The \u00bd\u201d Tygon tubing (Tygon, Saint-Gobain, La Defense, France) is used due to compatibility with the flow sensor and the soft material avoids damage to the 3D printed parts. The stiffer vinyl tubing is used where the loop bends through 90\u00b0 to ensure that the tubing does not kink whilst keeping the loop shorter, reducing the resistance.FluidExploded views showing the pinch valve stand assembly steps.The reservoir was supported by an acrylic stand that was recycled from a previous test loop. The stand allows the lower reservoir opening to be at approximately the same height as the shaft. Lab stands were used to simply support the pressure transducers. Custom pinch valve stands were developed to support the pinch valve and allow height adjustment to keep the pump outflow tubing level for different volute sizes. These have been slightly adapted from the original designs of Hansi Lang. The CAD files are supplied to laser cut the stand sections. To assemble the stand, glue the bracket section along the length of the base, locking in the tabs. Slide the centre sections over the bracket and glue the tabs to the base. Finally place the slide section between the centre sections and over the bracket. Fix the slide section to the desired height by tightening the M5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0mm bolt and M5 wing nuts fed through the holes and slots from the slide section. The 13\u00a0mm barbed ends attached to the pinch valve rest on the cradles of the slide section. See Fig. 19 for visualisation of the assembly steps.A water-glycerol solution is used as the working fluid to approximate the properties of blood in terms of density (1104\u00a0kg/m3) and viscosity (3.55 mPas). This equated to a ratio of approximately 43% glycerol by weight. Approximately 1.5 L of fluid is used in the setup.Loop ControlPneumaticsPneumatic control assembly.To control the flow rate of fluid around the circuit, compressed air is regulated to actuate the pneumatic pinch valve. For all threaded pneumatic connections thread tape was used to assist with sealing. Attach one male and one female air hose quick connect to each end of the PVC air hose, secured in place using the hose clamps. In our case, the male end was connected to a compressed air outlet in the lab, a small air compressor could be used as an alternative. Depending on the air supply, an alternative fitting may be necessary. Attach the 600PF quick connect to the inlet of the manual regulator via the \u00be\u201d male \u2013 male connector (Fig. 20). These components were readily available in the lab, however one of the quick connects from the six-piece set could be used if an appropriate connector to the manual regulator could be found, reducing the cost. Connect the manual regulator to the voltage regulator using the \u00be\u201d male \u2013 \u00bd\u201d male connector on the outlet of the manual regulator and the \u00bd\u201d female \u2013 male connector to the inlet of the voltage air regulator. This could be achieved with the single \u00be\u201d male \u2013 \u00bd\u201d male connector, however, this gave very little room between the regulators to fit the appropriate spanner. On the outflow of the voltage regulator screw in one of the push-in air tube connectors. Attach the other air tube connector to the pinch valve. Finally connect the soft nylon air tube to the push-in connectors. To control the voltage regulator a signal is supplied from the dSPACE (channel DA08).The equipment specified was readily available in the lab. A lower-cost alternative to control the flow rate could use a stepper motor attached to a screw clamp (such as a Hoffman clamp). The stepper motor would be controlled using another Arduino and programmed PID controller receiving feedback from the flow meter. The target could be programmed on a timer in the same manner as that used by the SimuLink code.Data acquisitionPressuresFlowPressure transducers (PX181B \u2013 015C5VX346, Omega Engineering, Norwalk, CT, USA) were connected to each 3-way tap located at the inflow and outflow of the pump. The 3-way taps allow air to be bled from the system easily as opposed to directly connecting the pressure transducer to the Luer connector. The inlet pressure and outlet pressure sensors are connected to the dSPACE through channels AD01 and AD02 respectively.PowerTransonic (TS410) flow meter.To monitor the flow rate a 10PXL Transonic flow sensor (10PXL, Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY, USA) is clipped on the Tygon tubing between the reservoir and inlet pressure transducer. The flow sensor is plugged into a TS410 Transonic flow meter (TS410, Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY, USA), which in turn is connected to AD05 on the dSPACE via BNC cable (Fig. 21).SimuLink and Control DeskTo record the power consumption used by the motor, the voltage and current are connected from the control box directly to the dSPACE using BNC cables. This can be done since the op amps can only output the maximum rail voltage of 12\u00a0V, avoiding damage to the dSPACE which is protected to an overvoltage of 15\u00a0V. The voltage and current are connected to channels AD03 and AD04 respectively on the dSPACE.Experimental run showing sufficient settling of pressure and flow rate at each flow increment.The provided Simulink file was developed to automate the experiment by increasing the flow rate by 0.5\u00a0L/min every 75\u00a0s. This timeframe was selected as it allows the flow rate and pressure sufficient time to settle before moving to the next target flow (Fig. 22). Control Desk (dSPACE, Paderborn, Germany) is used to display and record the data obtained from the dSPACE.Operation instructionsConnect all external cords to the control box. Connect the banana plugs to the power supply and set to 24\u00a0V. Using the touch screen adjust the \u201cAxial pos\u201d to move the motor mount platform approximately halfway along the linear rail system, disengaging the cup joint and roll pin, to allow room for shaft adjustment in later steps.Attach the impeller.Flow chart of operation process.The following operation instructions continue on from step 9 (attach pump base) of the build instructions for the test rig where the pump base and impeller mount have been fixed in place. An overview of the key steps of the operation procedure is presented in the following flow chart (Fig. 23).Once the epoxy has set, loosen the large shaft collars and set the position of the shaft so that there is a small gap between the back impeller face and pump base (<0.5\u00a0mm). Tighten the large collars against the bearing plate to secure the shaft position. This ensures no interference between the pump top and impeller during assembly.Fit the printed pump components.Measurement of the axial and radial variation using the dial gauge indicator.Attach the 3D printed impeller to the impeller mount using a small amount of 5-minute epoxy. Set up a dial gauge indicator to run along the back face of the impeller near the periphery (Fig. 24). The epoxy allows some time to adjust the impeller before curing. Using the dial gauge reading, aim to reduce the axial variation as much as possible. Note this value. Once satisfied, set up the dial gauge indicator (MeasumaX 34\u2013217, MeasumaX, Hare & Forbes Pty Ltd, Northmead, Australia) to run along the periphery face of the impeller and measure the amount of radial deviation. If this is outside of the acceptable range, the impeller is removed and requires reprinting. Take care when using the dial gauge indicator as any sudden impacts may strain the internal spring and cause the measurements to become inaccurate.Attach full pump assembly.3D printed pump assembly.Fit the 52\u00a0mm o-rings, one each in the groove of the pump base and in the groove of the pump top 3D printed parts. Mate the 3D printed volute to the pump base where the step aligns with the o-ring groove. Ensure that the volute outflow is aligned horizontally (Fig. 25). Mate the pump top o-ring groove to the volute step.Connect the Tygon tubing from the lower port of the reservoir to the inlet of the pump. Attach the Tygon tubing leading to the pinch valve to the pump outflow. Fill the reservoir with the water-glycerol solution. Slowly open the reservoir taps and allow the loop to fill. Slightly raise the reservoir and tilt the pinch valve to assist with filling. Stop and start the pump a few times to remove any remaining air from the system. Open the 3-way taps to bleed any air from the pressure transducers as any bubbles will interfere with the pressure readings. Turn the 3-way taps so that they are open between the pressure transducers and fluid.Set the axial clearance.a) Exploded view showing full pump assembly and b) photo showing assembled pump components.Place the acrylic plate over the pump inlet and against the pump top. Secure in place with the four M5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a065\u00a0mm bolts and M5 washers using the 3D printed spacers between the acrylic plate and slotted plate (see Fig. 26a). The spacers are used to ensure that the assembly is not overtightened and apply equal pressure. It is highly recommended that a torque wrench is used to ensure the bolts are tightened consistently. The torque wrench was set to 1 Nm. The bolts should be tightened in an opposing pattern to avoid warping of the printed parts and apply equal pressure around the pump assembly (Fig. 26b).Settle at a design point.Fully assembled test rig with set shaft position.The axial clearance between the impeller and pump top needs to be set. From here on, the large shaft collar closest to the motor will be referred to as the back collar and the large collar closest to the pump assembly, the front collar. Loosen the back collar and gently push the shaft forward while rotating the shaft by hand. When light contact is heard between the impeller and pump top, tighten the back collar and readjust the front collar to lock the shaft in place. Note the tightening and loosening of the collar screws may move the shaft slightly. If so, make the required minor adjustments. Set up the dial gauge indicator against the small collar and set the face to 0 at the needle. Loosen the front collar and gently pull the shaft away from the pump. The target distance is the desired clearance minus the variation measured from step 2. For example, for an impeller running with a variation of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcm from true and a desired clearance of 200\u00a0\u03bcm, the shaft should be positioned until the dial gauge shows 180\u00a0\u03bcm. This sets the average clearance to the desired value. Tighten the shaft collars in place, these may need small adjustments if the shaft moves during tightening of the screws. Remove the dial gauge. Using the touch screen, position the motor until the cup joint engages with the roll pin (Fig. 27).Turn off the PID controller and pump, repeat steps 7 and 8 a number of times until consistent values are recorded. This ensures that the setup is consistent, particularly the axial clearance which is very sensitive to the pump performance.Once the setup is acceptable turn the PID controller off in Control Desk. Turn the pump on from the touch screen. Allow the flow to settle and note the maximum flow rate. Round down this value to the nearest 0.5\u00a0L/min and input to the \u201cMax Flow\u201d. Reset the flow PID controller and turn on as in step 8.Slowly reduce the \u201cMax Flow\u201d by clicking the down arrow (0.5\u00a0L/min steps) until 0\u00a0L/min is reached. Turn off the motor. Gently remove the bearing adapter in the slotted plate and apply light redial pressure to the shaft in all directions, allowing a small amount of fluid to leak through ensuring the seal is wet. If parts of the seal run dry, the power consumption is greatly increased. Replace the bearing adapter in the slotted plate. Apply a low viscosity lubricant to the bearings. WD-40 (WD-40, San Diego, CA, USA) was used as it produced the most repeatable power consumption results. Turn on the motor and allow the readings to settle at 0\u00a0L/min flow rate.Start the experiment.Control Desk interface with numbered steps to reach design point.From Control Desk select \u201creset\u201d (1) then \u201cstop reset\u201d(2) when the pressure readings reach zero (3). Repeat if the values are not hovering around zero. Turn on the motor and set the speed to the desired value using the touch screen. By default, the flow PID controller will be off and allow the maximum achievable flow rate. Refer to the \u201cFlow Correction\u201d (4) as this shows the calibrated flow reading. Set the \u201cMax Flow\u201d (5) to a value lower than the maximum observed. The \u201cMax Flow\u201d sets the upper limit of the allowable flow rate to ensure safe limits of the signal sent to the air voltage regulator. Click \u201cPID reset\u201d (6), \u201cPID ready\u201d (7) then \u201cPID on\u201d (8). This resets the integral component of the flow PID controller then turns the controller on. Allow the pressure, flow (to \u201cMax Flow\u201d value) and power (9) readings to settle and record these values. The button locations are shown in Fig. 28.Before the first step is complete (75\u00a0s) set the \u201cMax Flow\u201d to a value of 0.2\u00a0L/min lower than the maximum achieved flow rate from step 10.Stop the experiment.Control Desk interface with numbered steps to start the experiment and record data.To start the test, click on \u201cRamp reset\u201d(1), \u201cSignal reset\u201d(2) and \u201cCounter reset\u201d(3). Then quickly select \u201cCounter ready\u201d(4), \u201cSignal Regular\u201d(5), \u201cRamp ready\u201d(6) then \u201cStart Recording\u201d(7) in the given order (Fig. 29). This resets all timing variables for the experiment and starts the recording.Close the reservoir taps. Place a small container under the pump assembly to collect the fluid draining from the loop. Remove the Tygon tubing from the outlet and inlet of the pump. Undo the nuts and bolts from step 5 and remove the pump top from the volute.Loosen the back collar and slide the shaft forward to allow access to the impeller mount grub screws. Gently pry the impeller off the impeller mount and remove any residual epoxy. Loosen the grub screws and remove the impeller mount from the shaft. Slide the shaft back into position and tighten the back collar to secure in place.Repeat steps 4, 5 and 6 (without the impeller or impeller mount). Wet the seal and lubricate the bearings as in step 11. Set the pump speed to that used in the experiment and turn on the motor. Click \u201cStart immediate\u201d (starts recording) and approximately 60\u00a0s later select \u201cStop Recording\u201d. The voltage and current readings recorded indicate the power consumed by the test rig (bearings, seals, motor windings, etc.) in order to run the pump at the desired speed.Turn off the motor and drain the loop as in step 15. Reattach the impeller mount to the shaft.Repeat all steps for impellers to be examined.Run the MatLab script to analyse the data and generate P-Q and efficiency curves.Control Desk interface with numbered steps to end the experiment.Click stop recording (1) after the flow rate signal (2) has reached a step higher than the value set in step 13 rounded up to the next 0.5\u00a0L/min. For example, if the maximum flow rate is set to 8.3\u00a0L/min, stop the recording at or after the signal shows 9.0\u00a0L/min (Fig. 30). This ensures that data has been recorded for the final data point. Turn off the flow PID controller and the motor.Validation and characterizationFlow rate calibrationA simple bucket test was used to calibrate the flow rate readings for the working fluid using the 10PXL flow sensor and Transonic flow meter. The test rig setup outlined above was used. Two longer lengths of \u00bd\u201d Tygon tubing were connected to the pump inlet and outlet. The reservoir consisted of a bucket (bucket 1) with approximately 6 L of working fluid. Another bucket (bucket 2) was placed on a set of scales and zeroed. A small Hoffman clamp was used to add resistance and dictate the flow rate. The tubing from the pump outflow was quickly transitioned to bucket 2 and the stopwatch started. The flow rate shown in Control Desk was recorded. Just before bucket 1 is emptied, the outflow tube was transitioned back to bucket 1 and the stopwatch stopped. The mass showing on the scales was recorded.Flow rate calibration data points with line-of-best-fit.Calculated flow rate gain and offset.\tGain\tOffset\t \tFlow Calibration\t1.0347\t\u22120.1027\t \tUsing the measured density (1104\u00a0kg/m3), time and mass, the actual flow rate can be calculated. The actual flow rate and the readings from Control Desk were recorded. The fluid from bucket 2 was transferred to bucket 1. Bucket 2 is replaced on the scales and re-zeroed to account for any residual fluid. The Hoffman clamp was adjusted to alter the flow rate and the process repeated. The measured data was plotted against the actual flow rate (Fig. 31) and the equation for the line of best fit noted. These values provide the gain and offset for the flow rate (Table 1). To validate, the new gains were input into Control Desk and obtained data for additional points, ensuring they matched the actual flow rate.Power calibrationIn a similar fashion to the flow rate, the voltage and current readings must be calibrated to give accurate power recordings. The gains calculated from the resistors in the op amp circuits could not be used as the ADC of the dSPACE had input impedance which altered the output voltage of the op amps The test loop was setup as outlined in the build instructions and operation instructions. The PID controller for the pinch valve was kept off (PID gains had not yet been determined), with the flow rate adjusted using a Hoffman clamp. Initially the pump speed and flow rate were set relatively low. The voltage and current values shown on Control Desk were recorded. The actual voltage was measured at the motor terminals using a multimeter (DigiTech Cat: QM-1320, Harman International Industries, Stamford, USA). The current passing through the motor was determined by measuring the voltage across the current sense resistor (using the DigiTech multimeter) and calculated using the formula I\u00a0=\u00a0V/R, where V is the voltage across the resistor and R is the value of the resistor (0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% \u2126).Voltage (left) and current (right) calibration data points with lines-of-best-fit.Calculated gains and offsets for the voltage and current measurements.\tGain\tOffset\t \tVoltage Calibration\t\u221229.4\t23.42\t \tCurrent Calibration\t4.75\t\u22120.0026\t \tThe Hoffman clamp was slightly released to allow a higher flow rate and hence higher load on the motor. All necessary values were recorded and the process repeated for multiple flow rates. The process of adjusting the flow rate was repeated for different pump speeds. The recorded data was plotted against the actual results and applied a line of best fit (Fig. 32). From the linear regression formula, the new gain and offset values for the voltage and current were input to Control Desk (Table 2). The new gains were checked by validating for a few different points. Additional data points may be required until satisfied that the recorded values match the actual values obtained from the multimeter.Pressure sensor calibrationThe pressure sensors used had been calibrated previously. To ensure the readings were still accurate, they were compared to those obtained using an NIST (certificate) calibrated pressure gauge (DPG1001B-15G, Omega Engineering, Norwalk, CT, USA). The pressure gauge was connected to the 3-way tap at the pump outlet along with one of the pressure sensors. The pump speed was increased and resistance added via the pinch valve in order to increase the pressure at the sampling point. The readings matched between the sensor and pressure gauge, confirming the sensor readings were still valid. The test was repeated with the second pressure sensor, which also produced validated measurements.PID controller tuningExperimental tuning values used for the flow rate and pump speed PID controllers.\tFlow Rate (SimuLink)\tPump Speed (Arduino)\t \tKP\t\u22120.36\t0.09\t \tKI\t\u22120.05\t0.0001\t \tKD\t\u22120.8\t0.06\t \tExperimental runs showing sufficient settling and stability of a) flow rate and b) motor speed PID gains.Tuning for each of the PID controllers used for pump speed (Arduino) and flow rate (dSPACE) could not be tuned individually. Since the pump speed effects the flow rate and vice versa (through pump load) the gain values were determined experimentally. The objective was to find a good balance between the settling time of the flow rate and maintaining pump speed when the target flow rate was changed by\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0L/min. The final values are presented in Table 3. Fig. 33 shows the flow rate and motor speed traces for an experimental run demonstrating the acceptable settling characteristics. Note the timing between the graphs is mismatched due to the motor speed being recorded from a different platform (Arduino serial port).All calibration and tuning gains were hard-coded into the Simulink file. Therefore, upon start-up, the gains from Table 3 are the default values.Setup repeatabilityRepeatability pump design parameters.\tDesign Value\t \tImpeller Diameter\t50\u00a0mm\t \tEye Diameter\t10\u00a0mm\t \tOutlet Angle\t22.5\u00b0\t \tInlet Angle\t35\u00b0\t \tInlet Height\t4.3\u00a0mm\t \tOutlet Height\t1.5\u00a0mm\t \tNumber of Blades\t6\t \tVolute Design\tConstant Mean Velocity\t \tAxial Clearance\t0.4\u00a0mm\t \tTo determine the repeatability of the setup, an impeller and volute were designed with the following parameters (Table 4) and is available in the supplied files.The impeller, volute and pump top (STL files provided) were 3D printed. Four identical copies of the impeller were printed to take into account any variation from the 3D printer. The first impeller was attached and the procedure followed as outlined in the operation instructions up to step 14. This starts the flow rate at 0\u00a0L/min and increases until the maximum flow is reached. The second test ran in reverse, decreasing the flow rate from maximum to 0\u00a0L/min. The purpose was to examine if any hysteresis exists in the circuit.Repeatability results for a) P-Q curves and b) efficiency curves from the initial repeatability tests (blue) and over time (red) with standard deviation error bars.The housing was then removed as in step 15 and reattached to introduce any variation in the pump assembly setup. The previous two experiments were then repeated by increasing and decreasing the flow rate. These (four previous) experiments were repeated for all four impeller prints, resulting in 16P \u2013 Q and efficiency curves. The average standard deviation for the P \u2013 Q curves was 0.7\u00a0mmHg and 0.46% for the efficiency curves (Fig. 34). These results are deemed well within acceptable bounds.For these repeatability tests, the detected pump speed was output via the Arduino serial port. The results showed that during the settled periods (data time intervals used to plot the curves) the speed varied by a maximum of\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0rpm with the vast majority of readings falling within\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0rpm. This confirms the PID gains for the speed controller are acceptable.Repeatability over timeEach day data was collected for a single run of the \u201crepeatability\u201d pump before gathering data for various pump designs. This allowed the performance parameters to be tracked over time (3\u00a0months, n\u00a0=\u00a038) as well as ensure that the test setup was functioning correctly.The average standard deviation for these P \u2013 Q curves was 1.2\u00a0mmHg and 0.7% for the efficiency curves (Fig. 34). These variations are higher than those from the initial repeatability tests. Likely causes are the component wear over time and simply due to the larger number of experiments (n\u00a0=\u00a016 vs. n\u00a0=\u00a038). The mean P-Q curves over time are on average 2.5\u00a0mmHg higher than the initial tests and efficiencies 1.57% higher.The difference in pressure places the initial (average) P \u2013 Q curve approximately two standard deviations below the (average) P \u2013 Q curve over time. The initial tests were performed using the same fluid. Before each \u2018check\u2019 repeatability test the fluid was adjusted to maintain a viscosity of 3.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 mPas. The viscosity was measured using a Brookfield DV2T viscometer with a Brooks and Wells cup and plate attachment having an accuracy of 0.06 mPas. Small variations in the fluid properties would slightly influence the pressure generated by the pump, reflected in the results obtained.The power usage in the initial tests was slightly higher (resulting in lower efficiency), likely caused by using a new seal. Whenever a new seal was required for following tests, it was allowed to run for approximately 8 hrs to properly wear in. The new seal adds more load to the shaft. Although this extra power is negated by subtracting the power usage without the impeller (step 17 of the operation instructions), the additional load causes the motor to heat up, increasing the resistance and hence the power drawn. The current setup could be improved by introducing a temperature probe on the motor to account for these additional losses.The purpose of the repeatability \u2018check\u2019 tests was to ensure correct functioning of the system and identify any component issues. Over the 3\u00a0month testing period which the test rig was utilised, only the seal required replacement. This was necessary approximately every 25\u00a0h of testing (excluding the 8\u00a0h run time to wear in the seal which was required with every seal replacement) to maintain acceptable accuracy levels. In the event of component failure, the \u2018check\u2019 test results would reflect the presence of an issue. The modular design of the system allows for easy replacement of components. The longevity of the system is maximised through the selection of high quality components and regular maintenance.Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.ReferencesFluid Dynamic Characteristics of the VentrAssist Rotary Blood PumpDesign Considerations of Volute Geometry of a Centrifugal Blood PumpComputational Fluid Dynamics Modeling of Impeller Designs for the HeartQuest Left Ventricular Assist Device"

IntroductionTissue invasion and metastasis, which cause 90% of cancer deaths, are common features during the development of most types of human cancer. The distant settlements of tumor cells can be, in general, classified into hematogenous metastasis and lymphogenous metastasis. Although invasion and metastasis are exceedingly complex processes, recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis have provided opportunities to develop new treatments to prevent metastasis.  Tumors express various angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors. VEGF family, among all, is perhaps the most important one. VEGF-A, the founding member of the family, has emerged as the key mediator of neovascularization in cancer. The biological functions of the VEGFs are mediated by a family of cognate protein tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFRs). VEGF-A binds to VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1; VEGF-C and VEGF-D bind VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3; PLGF and VEGF-B bind only to VEGFR-1; VEGF-E binds only to VEGFR-2. Signaling through VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 is crucial in the promotion of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, respectively. In addition to the expression on endothelial cells/lymphatic endothelial cells, VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3 has been shown to be expressed in a variety of human malignancies, including breast carcinoma. Much research has determined that the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 axis in cancer cells can promote growth of cancer cells, while the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis enhances mobility of cancer cells and contributes to the promotion of metastasis in animals. Given a significant role of VEGFR-2/VEGFR-3 in tumor development and progression, inhibition of both VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 and VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signals has shown promising results in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis in preclinical studies.Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinases has been found in human breast cancers and has been associated with poor patient prognosis. There are four FGFR genes (FGFR1\u2013FGFR4) that encode receptors consisting of three extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. In breast carcinoma, amplification and overexpression of FGFRs, including FGFR-1 (20%), FGFR-2 (12%), and FGFR-4 (30%), have been observed. These FGFRs mediate signaling from their high-affinity ligands, fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). The FGFs/FGFRs signaling interferes with many cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, transformation, and angiogenesis. In particular, recent advances have shown that FGFRs activity is linked to tumor growth, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and distant metastasis and thus contributes to tumor progression. Also, targeting FGFRs signaling has been shown to suppress tumor outgrowth and metastasis in pre-clinical models. Therefore, blocking VEGFRs/FGFRs activities may be of clinical benefit in the management of patients with highly metastatic breast cancer.  We have recently discovered a low molecular weight synthetic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with the 2H-indazole core. We identified NSTPBP 0100194-A (194-A) as a compound with particularly strong inhibitory potency against VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 kinase activity. In addition, 194-A showed similar potency against FGFR-1, FGFR-2, and FGFR-4, but was largely inactive against other tyrosine kinases. The kinase inhibitory signature of 194-A prompted us to evaluate this compound as a therapeutic for VEGFRs/FGFRs-dependent malignancies. In this study, we determined the effect of 194-A on both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis using a 4T1 mammary fat pad model and found that inhibition of VEGFRs/FGFRs dramatically suppressed tumor metastasis to regional lymph nodes and distant organs, via angiogenic and lymphangiogenic inhibition as well as suppressing the metastatic potential of tumor cells. 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell LinesHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) were purchased from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany). The high invasive breast cancer cell lines, 4T1 and MDA-MB231, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). These cells were cultured according to the vendor's guidelines. 4T1 cells were engineered to express the firefly luciferase protein for detection in vivo using Xenogen IVIS-100 imaging system. The luciferase positive population of 4T1 cells was selected in gentamicin (G418; Life Technologies). Bioluminescent, antibiotic resistant, and single-cell clones were amplified in culture and characterized for stable luminescence in vitro, and tumorigenic potential monitored in vivo.2.2. Kinase InhibitorNSTPBP 0100194-A (194-A), 1-(2-cyclohexenylethyl)-2-(2-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-2H-indazole-6-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carboxylic acid (see Supplementary Figure 1 in Supplementary Material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/718380) was provided by Dr. Chung-Ming Sun's laboratory at the Department of Applied Chemistry (National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan). The synthetic routes were described elsewhere and the kinase inhibitory profile was shown in Supplementary Table 1. For in vitro experiments, 194-A was dissolved in DMSO. For in vivo experiments, 194-A was prepared in a microemulsion containing 2\u2009mg 194-A, 8.3\u2009mg tricaprin, 50\u2009mg Tween 80, and 20\u2009mg propylene glycol in 1\u2009mL PBS buffer. 2.3. Antibodies and Reagents VEGF-C and VEGF-A165 were purchased from R&D Systems. The following primary antibodies were used: VEGFR-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY, USA); p-tyr1054 VEGFR-2 (Millipore); lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE-1) (R&D Systems); phosphorylated tyrosine (PY-99), VEGFR-3, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK1/2, phosphorylated Akt, Akt, CD31 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Biotin-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG and TRITC-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Sunitinib and sorafenib were purchased from Pfizer and Bayer, respectively. 2.4. Immunoprecipitation and Western BlotProtein lysates were prepared as previously described. Western blotting was performed with primary antibodies for p-tyr1054 VEGFR-2, VEGFR-2, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, p-Akt, and Akt, as noted. For immunoprecipitation, protein lysates were incubated with VEGFR-3 antibody immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1\u2009h at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation.2.5. Endothelial Cell Proliferation5 \u00d7 103 HUVECs or LECs were seeded in collagen-coated 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing 194-A or DMSO with 100\u2009ng/mL VEGF-A or 500\u2009ng/mL VEGF-C for 12\u2009h. Cell proliferation was performed by MTS assay (Promega). Data were collected from three replicates.2.6. Endothelial Cell MigrationAssessment of endothelial cell migratory activity was performed as described. 3 \u00d7 104 HUVECs or LECs were suspended in serum-free media and seeded in the top chamber of a cell culture insert (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) after treatment with DMSO or 194-A for 30\u2009min. The insert was placed in a 24-well plate containing serum-free medium with control protein, VEGF-A (100\u2009ng/mL) or VEGF-C (500\u2009ng/mL); the cells were incubated for 24\u2009h and migrating cells were stained with crystal violet (Sigma, St Louis, MI, USA). The migratory activity was calculated as a percentage of migratory cells in the test samples versus control.2.7. Invasion AssayInvasion assays were done using modified Boyden chambers with Matrigel (30\u2009\u03bcg, Collaborative Biomedical, Becton Dickinson Labware, San Jose, CA, USA) coated filter inserts for 24-well plates. Cells (1 \u00d7 105) were pretreated with DMSO or 194-A for 30\u2009min and plated into 100\u2009\u03bcL of low serum (1% FBS) RPMI or DMEM in the top chamber. The insert was placed in a 24-well plate containing low serum medium with control protein, FGF-2 (20\u2009ng/mL) or VEGF-C (100\u2009ng/mL) for 24\u2009hr. The cells that invaded through the Matrigel and attached to the lower surface of the filter were stained with crystal violet and calculated.2.8. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay 4T-1 cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates and treated with various concentrations (0, 1, 3, and 10\u2009\u03bcM) of 194-A for 24\u2009h, and cell viabilities were assessed using the MTS (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) assay. The absorbance (A) was read at 490\u2009nm using an ELISA reader (MQX200; BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).2.9. 4T1 Tumor Model In Vivo  Female BALB/c mice were orthotopically injected with 2.5 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc+ cells, suspended in PBS, into the right fat pad. Tumors were measured every three days according to (tumor size = length \u00d7 width2\u2009\u2009\u00d7 0.52). Mice were given 194-A, sorafenib (in cremophor EL/ethanol), or sunitinib (in citrate-buffer solution) as oral administrations of 50\u2009mg/kg/day or other dosage, as noted. Treatment was initiated after tumors reached 75\u2009mm3 and lasted until the endpoint of the experiment. Mice were imaged once a week, by injecting 150\u2009mg/kg luciferin i.p. and imaging the tumors using bioluminescence technology (Xenogen IVIS-100 imaging system). For primary tumors, the exposure time ranged from 5 seconds to 1 minute depending on the size of the tumor. For detection of metastatic tumor nodules, exposure time was extended to 5 minutes. To exclude treatment related toxicity, mice were weighted every two days. Lymph node, distal organs (lung and liver) metastasis, and primary tumor weights were excised at the end of the experiment. All experiments were repeated at least twice with a minimum of 5 mice per group.2.10. Tumor Vascularity Detection In Vivo  Tumor vascularity was monitored by using non-contrast-enhanced flow-sensitive ultrasound (Vevo 770 micro-ultrasound system). Non-contrast-enhanced flow-sensitive ultrasound predominantly visualized the vessel networks on the tumor margins, some of which branched toward the tumor center. Tumor vascularity was quantified in power Doppler images by computing the color pixel density, which is equal to the percentage of image voxels within a region of interest that exhibits detectable flow.2.11. Pharmacokinetics of p.o. 194-A Administration in MiceBALB/C mice received a single dose of 50\u2009mg/kg 194-A by oral gavage, and plasma samples were collected at different time points. The plasma samples were prepared for ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) analysis, by protein precipitation with two volumes of acetonitrile (100\u2009\u03bcL) per 50\u2009\u03bcL plasma sample. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by MassLynx 4.1 software.2.12. ImmunohistochemistryTumor tissues were processed for either paraffin or OCT sections as previously described. CD31 and PCNA staining was detected using streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method by DAB Peroxidase Substrate Kit (SK-4100; Vector Laboratories). Detection of LYVE-1 was performed using TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibody under a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. Microvessel density (MVD) and lymphatic vessel length (LVL) were quantified for each 200x field using ProImage software. For each tumor section, 3-4 fields were counted. The number of PCNA-positive cells, among at least 500 cells per field, was counted and expressed as percentage values.2.13. In Vivo Cell Death AnalysisDeadEnd Fluorometric Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-Mediated Nick-End Labeling System (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to evaluate the cell death in sections of 4T1 tumors obtained from control and test compounds-treated animals, according to the manufacturer's instructions.2.14. Statistical AnalysisDifferences between the means of unpaired samples were evaluated by the Student's t-test and differences in the median values between the two groups were evaluated by Wilcoxon rank-sum test using the SigmaPlot and SigmaStat programs. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were of two sided.3. Results3.1. The In Vivo and In Vitro Antitumor Activity of 194-A in a Metastasis-Specific Mouse Mammary Carcinoma 4T1To evaluate the antitumor activity of 194-A on primary tumor growth and metastasis, a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line, 4T1, was used. 4T1 is a highly metastatic tumor cell that can metastasize to the lung, liver, and lymph nodes while the primary tumor is growing in situ. 194-A was administered p.o. and evaluated in an orthotopic graft model. 4T1-Luc+ cells were inoculated into the mammary fat pad and allowed to establish for 9 days before initiation of treatment. 4T1-Luc+ orthotopic graft mice were treated with daily administrations of different dosages of 194-A (10~50\u2009mg/kg) or vehicle control using oral gavage.  Figure 1(a) showed the inhibitory potency of 194-A (50\u2009mg/kg) on tumor growth after 10 days of treatment by photon emissions detection in vivo. The mean tumor volume from caliper measurement showed that treatment with 194-A resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth (Figure 1(b)). In 194-A-treated mice receiving 25 or 50\u2009mg/kg daily, the mean tumor volume on day 30 was inhibited by 38% (P < 0.05) and 55% (P < 0.01), respectively, relative to the vehicle-treated 4T1 tumors (Figure 1(b)). Next, we examined the effects of 194-A on cell proliferation and apoptosis within the 4T1 tumors after 10 days of treatment. The immunohistochemical analysis of cell proliferation was performed using PCNA staining. The mean number of PCNA positive tumor cells was reduced with 60% after treatment with 194-A compared to control mice (Figure 1(c)). Additionally, the number of TUNEL positive cells was increased 4.3-fold in the 194-A treated group compared to the control group (Figure 1(d)). However, 194-A, at a concentration up to 10\u2009\u03bcM for 24\u2009h treatment, had no significant effect on 4T1 cells growth in vitro (Figure 1(e)). These experimental results clearly verify that 194-A can suppress in vivo tumor growth of 4T1 cells without significantly altering their in vitro growth rate. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a maximal plasma concentration (C max\u2061)\u2009\u2009~7500\u2009ng/mL at 0.75 hour, while the plasma levels were below 500\u2009ng/mL at 12 hours after administration of 50\u2009mg/kg 194-A. The p.o. bioavailability of 194-A in BALB/c mice was ~55%. The rapid reduction in 194-A levels implies that 194-A rapidly metabolize to another metabolite, but which metabolite exhibited antitumor activity in vivo must be further explored (Figure 1(f)).3.2. The Antiangiogenesis Efficacy of 194-A in the 4T1 Tumor Model194-A exhibited significant activity against VEGFR-2 (Supplementary Table 1), the RTK known to promote angiogenesis. We, therefore, determined the effect of 194-A on intratumoral vasculature. We utilized a high frequency volumetric power Doppler ultrasound (HF-VPDU) to measure blood flow within large vessels of tumor vasculature with high flow velocities. Though HF-VPDU is a non-contrast-enhanced imaging, therapeutical effects can be recognized on the depicted vessels visually.  Figure 2(a) showed that the intratumoral vascularity in orthotopic grafts was drastically decreased compared with control tumors after the 10-day 194-A treatment. The antiangiogenic effect of 194-A was also verified by immunohistochemical analysis with an endothelial cell marker, CD31, on primary tumor tissue (Figure 2(b), upper panel). Administration of 194-A at 50\u2009mg/kg p.o. produced 64% inhibition of the microvessel density (MVD) relative to vehicle-treated 4T1 tumors (Figure 2(b), bottom panel). In vitro, a dose-dependent decrease in VEGF-A-induced HUVECs proliferation was observed upon addition of 194-A (Figure 2(c)). 194-A at 1\u2009\u03bcM significantly inhibited VEGF-A-induced HUVECs proliferation. Similar inhibitory effect by 194-A on HUVECs migration was also observed (Figure 2(d)). Furthermore, we examined the effect of 194-A on VEGF-A-induced VEGFR-2 activity and their downstream signaling targets in primary HUVECs. 194-A at 1\u2009\u03bcM inhibited VEGF-A-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (Tyr 1054), ERK1/2, and Akt significantly (Figure 2(e)). Overall, these data demonstrate that administration of 194-A suppresses angiogenesis in 4T1 tumors, which may account for the antitumor activity of 194-A.3.3. Significant Antimetastatic and Antilymphangiogenic Effect of 194-A in the 4T1 Tumor ModelIn contrast to modest tumor growth inhibition, formation of spontaneous lung metastasis was dramatically prevented by 194-A (~94% inhibition) as measured by luciferase expression (Figure 3(a)). Visual comparison of mouse lungs showed marked growth of lung metastasis in vehicle-treated group, but few established invasive metastasis in 194-A-treated group (Figure 3(a)). In addition, H&E staining revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of lung, liver, and lymph node tumor metastasis in response to 194-A treatment (Figures 3(b) and 3(c)). Metastasis to lymph nodes occurred in 8.5% \u00b1 3.5% and to the lung in 25% \u00b1 8% after 194-A treatment, whereas metastasis to the lymph nodes and lung occurred in 41.5 \u00b1 8.5% and 100%, respectively, in vehicle-treated mice. Notably, immunofluorescent analysis with a lymph endothelial cell marker, LYVE-1, showed that the mean lymphatic vessel length (MLVL) was decreased by 194-A (~70% inhibition) compared to vehicle treatment (Figure 3(d)). In vitro, 194-A dose dependently inhibited VEGF-C-induced LECs proliferation and migration (Figures 3(e) and 3(f)). In parallel, the activation of VEGFR-3 and its downstream signaling pathway induced by VEGF-C were inhibited by 194-A in a dose-dependent manner and almost abolished by 194-A at 1\u2009\u03bcM (Figure 3(g)). These experimental results demonstrated the antilymphangiogenesis efficacy of 194-A, which at least in part accounts for its antimetastatic effect.3.4. 194-A Reduces the VEGF-C and FGF-2-Induced Invasive Effects of Mammary Carcinoma Cell LinesEarlier studies of VEGFRs/FGFRs signaling on tumor cells have prompted us to evaluate whether 194-A would reduce the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Here, we found that stimulation with VEGF-C in two VEGFR-3+ mammary carcinoma cell lines, 4T1 (Supplementary Figure 2(a)) and MDA-MB231, resulted in a significant increase of invasive ability (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). A dose-dependent decrease in VEGF-C-induced invasion was observed upon addition of 194-A (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Furthermore, increased levels of FGFR-1 and FGFR-2 expression were observed in 4T1 (Supplementary Figure 2(b)) and MDA-MB231 cells. FGF-2 stimulation substantially increased the invasiveness of MDA-MB231 and 4T1 cells. Likewise, 3\u2009\u03bcM 194-A effectively suppressed the FGF-2 induced invasion of this two breast cancer cell lines (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). These works further support the anti-metastatic potential of 194-A by targeting VEGFRs/FGFRs signaling.3.5. The Antimetastatic Effects of 194-A Are Comparable with Sunitinib and SorafenibGiven our observations that inhibition of VEGFRs/FGFRs signaling caused significant metastasis inhibition, we compared the therapeutic effects of 194-A, sunitinib, and sorafenib on metastasis of 4T1 to distant lung. Sunitinib and sorafenib are clinically used VEGFRs/PDGFR inhibitors with stronger potency than 194-A in inhibiting VEGFRs. We treated tumor-bearing mice using oral gavage with 50\u2009mg/kg 194-A, sunitinib, or sorafenib daily starting 9 days after inoculation and administered for 30 days. While 194-A significantly reduced the primary tumor growth by 50% compared to the vehicle control (P = 0.047), sunitinib and sorafenib were shown to be more effective than 194-A (P = 0.009 and 0.048) (Figure 5(a)). Of note, using photon emissions detection of lung metastasis, we found that 194-A has comparable potency to sunitinib and sorafenib in preventing 4T1 metastasis to lung at the end of treatment (P = 0.75 and 0.92).  Figure 5(b) showed that the median value of photon emissions from the lungs was 2.9 \u00d7 105 (for 194-A), 1.9 \u00d7 105 (for sunitinib), 2.5 \u00d7 105 (for sorafenib), and 1.4 \u00d7 106 (for vehicle). No significant difference in body weight was detected among these four groups (Figure 5(c)). These experimental results suggest that the kinase inhibitory profile of 194-A (VEGFRs/FGFRs) might be feasible for preventing breast cancer metastasis.4. DiscussionMuch research has determined the requirement of angiogenesis for growth and progression of dormant lesions. It is of particular interest to determine whether antiangiogenic approach will not only reduce tumor growth but also block the progression of dormant lesions into aggressive cancers or metastasis in high-risk cancer patients. The multikinase inhibitor 194-A was an equally potent inhibitor of VEGFRs and FGFRs in cell-free assay (Supplementary Table 1). Administration of 194-A (p.o.) partially reduced tumor growth of 4T1 cells injected into the mammary fat pad and drastically reduced metastasis to distal organs. Histological analyses revealed decreased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in tumor section from 194-A-treated mice, highlighting the impact of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis on tumor development and progression. 194-A treatment substantially reduced breast cancer cell motility and invasive ability associated with VEGFRs/FGFRs. The anti-metastatic potency of 194-A can be attributed by the synergistic inhibitory effects, which are achieved by targeting different signaling circuits, not only in endothelial cells, but also in cancer cells. Furthermore, we confirmed the effect of 194-A on tumor growth and metastasis using xenograft models of two highly metastatic cell lines, Lewis lung carcinoma, and B16/F10 (data not shown). These studies implicate the pivotal role of VEGFRs/FGFRs in cancer progression and metastasis.Angiogenesis itself is a complex, multistep process that follows stage- and tissue-specific regulations. Various angiogenic factors have been identified that form an intimate network regulating angiogenesis. The most successful anti-angiogenic approaches are likely to involve combinatorial strategies to target the angiogenic factors appearing on the central stage of the angiogenesis network, such as VEGF, FGF, and PDGF. Some dual-action inhibitors have emerged that are more effective in restraining cancer growth. For example, sunitinib inhibits PDGF and VEGF receptors; ZD6474 inhibits VEGFR and EGFR; VX-322 inhibits FLT-3 and c-KIT. Both VEGF and FGF are potent angiogenic factors. An intimate crosstalk exists among FGF-2 and the different members of the VEGF family during angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Previous reports have demonstrated that combinatory inhibition of VEGFR-1 and FGFR-1 produced an enhanced suppression of tumor growth in different types of cancer. Our observation is in line with these studies, suggesting that blockade of both VEGFRs and FGFRs would efficiently inhibit angiogenesis.Preventative antiangiogenic strategies could be especially useful in patients who are at high risk for developing metastasis. Few experimental studies in animals, as well as in clinical trials, have already shown promising results. For example, angiostatin and endostatin reduced the formation of metastasis in the murine Lewis lung carcinoma model. Additionally, regional lymph nodes are often the primary sites for metastasis, emphasizing the importance of the lymphatic system in metastatic process. Blocking the lymphangiogenic process has reduced metastasis to both the lymph node and distant organs. Dual inhibition of both VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 appeared to be a better strategy to suppress tumor metastasis as both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 are essentially involved in tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Supportive evidence from previous report showed that combination treatment using anti-VEGFR-2 and anti-VEGFR-3 antibodies more potently decreased lymph node and lung metastasis than each antibody treated alone. The results of our study also highlight the significance of inhibition of VEGFR-3 and VEGFR-2 kinases in lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells, which reduced lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis, resulted in inhibition of regional lymph node and distal organs metastasis. The invasive ability of tumor cell is a critical determinant of the metastatic phenotype of human cancers. Several sets of growth factors and their cognate receptors have been reported to be importantly involved in the regulation of tumor invasion and metastasis. Earlier, we have demonstrated that the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signal directly promote cancer cells invasion and increase both lymph node and lung metastasis in xenograft model of human lung adenocarcinoma. Treatment with a soluble form of VEGFR-3 (Flt4/Fc) suppressed lung and lymph node metastasis of two distinct lung tumor cell lines (A549 cells and VEGF-C-overexpressing H928 cells). 194-A might, therefore, directly inhibit VEGFR-3 in tumor cells, to down-regulate invasive activity and suppress tumor metastasis. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that FGFRs can mediate cell proliferation and the invasive ability of breast cancer cells. Indeed, both 4T1 (Supplementary Figure 2(b)) and MDA-MB-231 cells expressed high levels of FGFR-2. We found that 194-A inhibited FGF-2-induced invasive ability of 4T1 cells more significantly than other chemoattractant (fibronectin) (data not shown). These observations suggest that the antitumor metastasis activity of 194-A in vivo might be, at least in part, attributed to reduced tumor cell invasiveness via inhibition of VEGFR-3- and FGFRs-mediated signaling on tumor cells.Multiple pathways promote tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. To restrict the metastatic spread of cancer, the ideal drug should counteract the essential angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors produced by cancer cells and/or stromal cells during tumor progression. Clinically, VEGFRs/FGFRs expression is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer type. 5. ConclusionThis study has validated the VEGFRs/FGFRs-mediated signaling pathways as a potential therapeutic target for inhibiting the metastatic spread of tumor cells. These encouraging data support further evaluation of VEGFRs/FGFRs inhibition for the treatment of highly metastatic cancer. It will also be tempting to determine whether this inhibition combined with conventional cytotoxic therapy could result in added efficacy without drawbacks in the near future.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

        "content": "The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by breast tumors has been previously correlated with a poor prognosis in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Furthermore, VEGF secretion is a prerequisite for tumor development. Although most of the effects of VEGF have been shown to be attributable to the stimulation of endothelial cells, we present evidence here that breast tumor cells are capable of responding to VEGF. We show that VEGF stimulation of T-47D breast cancer cells leads to changes in cellular signaling and invasion. VEGF increases the cellular invasion of T-47D breast cancer cells on Matrigel/ fibronectin-coated transwell membranes by a factor of two. Northern analysis for the expression of the known VEGF receptors shows the presence of moderate levels of Flt-1 and low levels of Flk-1/KDR mRNAs in a variety of breast cancer cell lines. T-47D breast cancer cells bind 125I-labeled VEGF with a Kd of 13 x 10(-9) M. VEGF induces the activation of the extracellular regulated kinases 1,2 as well as activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, Akt, and Forkhead receptor L1. These findings in T-47D breast cancer cells strongly suggest an autocrine role for VEGF contributing to the tumorigenic phenotype.",

        "full_text": " TAS3681, an androgen receptor antagonist, prevents drug resistance driven by aberrant androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancerSecond\u2010generation androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors (ARSIs), such as abiraterone and enzalutamide, prolong the life of patients with castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, patients receiving ARSIs ultimately develop resistance through various complex mechanisms, including AR mutations, constitutively active AR\u2010splice variants (AR\u2010Vs), and AR overexpression. Here, we characterized a novel AR pure antagonist, TAS3681, which inhibits AR transcriptional activity and downregulates AR\u2010full length (AR\u2010FL) and AR\u2010Vs. TAS3681 reduced the protein levels of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs including AR\u2010V7 in enzalutamide\u2010resistant cells (SAS MDV No. 3\u201014), in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo, showing strong antitumor efficacy in an AR\u2010V7\u2010positive xenograft model. In AR\u2010overexpressing VCaP (prostate cancer) cells, conversely to enzalutamide, TAS3681 effectively suppressed cell proliferation and downregulated AR expression. Importantly, TAS3681 blocked the transcriptional activity of various mutant ARs, including mutations F877L/T878A and H875Y/T878A, which confer resistance to enzalutamide, and V716M and H875Y mutations, which confer resistance to darolutamide. Our results demonstrate that TAS3681 suppresses the reactivation of AR signaling, which causes resistance to ARSIs, via a newly identified mechanism of action. Therefore, TAS3681 could be a new therapeutic option for CRPC treatment.The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist TAS3681 is effective against AR mutations, which leads to agonistic activity of AR signal inhibitors, and had an antitumor effect in an AR\u2010splice variant 7 (AR\u2010V7)\u2010positive enzalutamide\u2010resistant xenograft model. TAS3681 suppresses aberrant AR activation, including AR overexpression and expression of constitutively active nuclear\u2010localized AR\u2010V7, via downregulation of AR and AR\u2010V7.

Initiation and progression PCa depend on androgen receptor (AR) activity. The standard treatment for advanced PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which suppresses the transcriptional activity of ARs. ADT induces remission for 1\u20132\u2009years in most patients, but cancer cells become resistant owing to the emergence of metastatic castration\u2010resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Earlier, first\u2010generation antiandrogens such as bicalutamide and flutamide were the standard treatment approaches against mCRPC; however, the partial agonist activity of the compounds has led to low drug efficacy and drug resistance in patients with mCRPC. Over the past decade, enzalutamide, a second\u2010generation AR antagonist, and abiraterone, a CYP17A1 inhibitor, have proven effective against mCRPC and rapidly become standard therapies for advanced\u2010stage PCa. Despite their success, development of resistance against AR\u2010targeted therapies and maintenance of AR expression occurs in PCa. AR signaling can continue via several potential mechanisms despite treatment with antiandrogen therapies. These include mutations in the AR ligand\u2010binding domain (LBD), AR amplification, expression of AR\u2010splice variants (AR\u2010Vs), and alternative AR activation.Here, we describe the characterization of TAS3681, an orally bioavailable AR antagonist that binds to the AR, inhibiting its nuclear translocation as well as its ligand\u2010dependent and \u2010independent transcriptional activity. TAS3681 also inhibits clinically relevant AR mutations that confer resistance to first\u2010 and second\u2010generation AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs).Materials and methodsCell cultureVCaP (RRID:CVCL_2235), COS\u20107 (RRID:CVCL_0224), and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA); HEK293 (RRID:CVCL_0045) cells were purchased from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan); MIAPaCa\u20102 (RRID:CVCL_0428), SK\u2010OV\u20103 (RRID:CVCL_0532), MCF\u20107 (RRID:CVCL_0031), and T\u201047D (RRID:CVCL_0553) cells were purchased from Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.

Two and a half micrograms of total RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Life Technologies Corporation). To detect indicated genes, each cDNA sample was amplified using TaqMan\u00ae Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies Corporation) using an ABI7900HT Real\u2010Time qPCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The gene\u2010specific primers for cDNA and SYBR Green dye detection or TaqMan MGB or VIC probe were used (Table\u00a0S1).

For the CHX chase assay, LNCaP and SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were cultured in RPMI\u2010PR\u2010 containing 5% cFBS. On the next day, LNCaP and SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were treated with 5 or 10\u2009\u03bcm of TAS3681 or 1\u2009\u03bcm of 17\u2010AAG for 0, 4, 8, or 24\u2009h in the presence of 10\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 of CHX. Expression of AR protein was evaluated using WB. For the Act D chase assay, LNCaP and SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were cultured in RPMI\u2010PR\u2010 containing 5% cFBS. On the next day, LNCaP cells were treated with 5 or 10\u2009\u03bcm of TAS3681 or 30\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 of CHX for 0, 4, 8, or 24\u2009h in the presence of 5\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 Act D. Expression of AR protein and mRNA was evaluated using WB and gene expression analysis, respectively. In\u2009vivo experimentFive\u2010week\u2010old male CB\u201017/Icr\u2010scid/scidJcl mice (SCID mice) were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The mice were castrated at 6\u2009weeks of age and subcutaneously injected with SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. To evaluate the antitumor activity, animals bearing SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cell xenografts were randomized on day 1 according to tumor volume, once the mean tumor volume had reached ~\u2009130\u2013250\u2009mm3, and administered with 7.5, 15, and 22.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121 body weight of TAS3681 or vehicle control (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose; HPMC) twice daily by oral gavage for 14\u2009days. The tumor volume and the body weight of mice were measured twice a week. The tumor volume (mm3) was defined as (A\u2009\u00d7\u2009B 2)/2, where A and B were the longest and the shortest tumor diameter, respectively. Relative tumor volume (RTV) on day 15 was calculated as the ratio of tumor volume (TV) on day 15 to that on day 0. On days 1 and 15, blood was collected from the facial vein, and serum was separated. Serum prostate\u2010specific antigen (PSA) concentrations were assessed using a PSA ELISA kit (Catalog #DKK300; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the data were used to calculate the PSA ratio. The PSA ratio was calculated by dividing the PSA concentration of each sample on day 15 by that on day 1.The mice were kept in the specific pathogen free animal facility with 12/12\u2009h light/dark cycle. The animal facility is regularly tested for standard pathogens. Mice were fed no more than five per cage with free access to sterile water and food. Animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Approval No. AE\u20102016\u2010101) and carried out according to their guidelines for animal experiments.Statistical analysesResults are reported as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation (SD) for in\u2009vitro experiments or mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean (SEM) for in\u2009vivo experiments. Statistical analyses and determination of the half\u2010maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were performed using sas version 9.2 and exsus version 8.0.0 (CAC Exicare Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical significance was assessed using the Student's t\u2010test or Wilcoxon test for two groups and the Dunnett's test, nonparametric Dunnett's test, or Williams' test for more than three groups. In all analyses, statistical significance was set at P\u2009<\u20090.05.ResultsTAS3681 is a novel AR pure antagonist with AR downregulation activityThrough modification of N\u2010arylpiperazine\u20101\u2010carboxamide compounds, we discovered TAS3681 as a novel nonsteroidal compound in a screening campaign using AR transactivation assay, DHT\u2010dependent cell proliferation assay, and another cellular assay designed to detect compounds with the capacity to downregulate AR expression in LNCaP cells, and subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization (Fig.\u00a01A). In the present study, a competitive AR\u2010binding assay was performed to investigate the binding affinity of TAS3681 to wild\u2010type AR and AR T878A mutants. The inhibition constant (K i) values of TAS3681 against wild\u2010type AR and AR T878A mutant were 7.39 and 23.8\u2009nm, respectively (Table\u00a0S2). These values were comparable to those of enzalutamide (7.11\u2009nm for wild\u2010type AR and 22.6\u2009nm for AR T878A mutant) and apalutamide (6.01\u2009nm for wild\u2010type AR and 115.0\u2009nm for AR T878A mutant) that were tested under the same conditions (Table\u00a0S2). AR transactivation assays were performed using an AR\u2010responsive reporter along with a wild\u2010type AR in COS\u20107 cells and VCaP cells that express wild\u2010type AR. TAS3681 was a potent antagonist for wild\u2010type AR with IC50 values of 52.7 and 60.9\u2009nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01B, Fig.\u00a0S1 and Table\u00a0S3). These values were comparable to those of enzalutamide (59.7 and 117.7\u2009nm). Bicalutamide showed weaker antagonist activity (IC50 values of 429 and 662.5\u2009nm for wild\u2010type AR) and could not completely block the transcriptional activity of wild\u2010type AR even at 1000\u2009nm because of its partial agonist profile\u00a0 (Fig.\u00a01B, Fig.\u00a0S1 and Table\u00a0S3). Moreover, AR transactivation assays were performed using an AR\u2010responsive reporter along with LNCaP that express T878A mutant. TAS3681 also shown potent antagonist activity (IC50 value of 10.1\u2009nm) similar to enzalutamide (IC50 value of 12.5\u2009nm) (Fig.\u00a01B and Table\u00a0S3). To determine whether the anti\u2010AR transcriptional activity of TAS3681 is accompanied by reduced cell proliferation, the number of viable VCaP and LNCaP cells was quantified after incubation with TAS3681. TAS3681 suppressed the DHT\u2010induced proliferation of VCaP cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner, with an IC50 of 170\u2009nm, which was comparable to that of enzalutamide (IC50 of 180\u2009nm) (Fig.\u00a01C and Table\u00a0S4). TAS3681, as well as enzalutamide and bicalutamide, also dose\u2010dependently suppressed LNCaP cell proliferation, with an IC50 of 18\u2009nm. Enzalutamide and bicalutamide had IC50 values of 55 and 340\u2009nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01C and Table\u00a0S4). Consistent with the results of the antagonist assay, bicalutamide showed weaker inhibition of cell proliferation in VCaP and LNCaP, and the IC50 values for bicalutamide in each cell line were approximately 3\u2010 and 19\u2010fold higher, respectively, than those for TAS3681. Therefore, TAS3681 inhibited DHT\u2010induced cell proliferation more potently than bicalutamide, and with activity similar to enzalutamide.TAS3681 inhibits AR function and downregulates AR. (A) Chemical structure of TAS3681. (B) Effect of TAS3681, enzalutamide, and bicalutamide on the transcriptional activity of the wild\u2010type AR in COS\u20107 cells (upper panel) or the T878A mutant AR in LNCaP cells (lower panel). COS\u20107 cells were transfected with pGL4.36 luciferase (containing androgen\u2010dependent murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat), Renilla luciferase plasmids, and AR expression vector, and incubated for 1\u2009day. LNCaP cells were transfected with the pGLPE luciferase plasmid and incubated for 1\u2009day. COS\u20107 cells and LNCaP cells were treated with various concentrations of TAS3681, enzalutamide, or bicalutamide with 1\u2009nm DHT for COS\u20107 or with 0.1\u2009nm DHT for LNCaP, respectively, in steroid\u2010depleted medium for 1\u2009day before luciferase activity measurements. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. The IC50 values are presented in Table\u00a0S3. (C) Inhibitory effect of TAS3681, enzalutamide, and bicalutamide on DHT\u2010induced proliferation of VCaP (left panel) and LNCaP cells (right panel). VCaP cells were treated with various concentrations of TAS3681, enzalutamide, and bicalutamide in the presence of DHT for 3\u2009days. The dashed line indicates cell viability in the absence of DHT. Results are expressed as mean of sextuplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. (D) AR and GAPDH protein expression in LNCaP cells treated with TAS3681, enzalutamide, and TOK\u2010001. LNCaP cells were treated with either the test compounds or DMSO for 1\u2009day. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for AR and GAPDH to confirm equal loading. The numbers under each blot represent the relative expression value of the AR protein relative to that of DMSO\u2010treated cells. TOK\u2010001 was used as a positive control for the reduction in AR expression. A representative experiment (of 2) is shown. AR, androgen receptor; Enz, enzalutamide; TOK, TOK\u2010001.No significant effect of TAS3681 was observed on the viability of AR\u2010negative cells, such as MIAPaCa\u20102 (human pancreatic carcinoma), HCC1806 (human breast cancer), SK\u2010OV\u20103 (human ovarian cancer), and DU145 (human prostate cancer) indicating that the antiproliferative effect of TAS3681 in AR\u2010positive PCa cells is mediated through AR antagonism (Figs\u00a0S2 and S3).We evaluated the effect of TAS3681 on AR protein levels using WB with an AR antibody\u2010N\u2010terminal. LNCaP cells were treated with TAS3681 for 1\u2009day; TAS3681, but not enzalutamide, reduced AR expression in a dose\u2010dependent manner (Fig.\u00a01D). Similar results were observed for VCaP cells (Fig.\u00a0S4). In addition, TAS3681 downregulated AR protein, but had little effect on the protein levels of other nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor (Fig.\u00a0S5). Overall, the findings suggest that TAS3681 has the same potential as enzalutamide, a representative second\u2010generation compound, as an AR pure antagonist, but also has unique AR reduction activity.TAS3681 functions as a pure antagonist for various AR mutantsAndrogen receptor movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon androgen binding is an essential step in AR\u2010mediated gene transcription. Second\u2010generation small\u2010molecule ARSIs, including enzalutamide, block the nucleo\u2010cytoplasmic translocation of AR and DNA binding without any AR agonist activity. As shown in Fig.\u00a02A, AR was predominantly localized in cytoplasm in the absence of androgen, and DHT addition increased the nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio of fluorescent intensity (N/C ratio: approximately 2.2), indicating the translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig.\u00a02B).TAS3681 impairs nuclear translocation and DNA binding of AR in prostate cancer cells. (A) Representative confocal microscopic images of the U\u20102 OS tomato\u2010AR cells stably expressing tdTomato fused AR pretreated for 0.5\u2009h with 1\u2009\u03bcm of TAS3681, enzalutamide, or bicalutamide, followed by treatment for 4\u2009h with the compounds in the presence of 0.1\u2009nm DHT in the steroid\u2010depleted medium. The fluorescence images are cropped from photographs taken at a magnification of 10\u00d7 using an objective lens and a dichroic mirror. The nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). A representative experiment (of 2) is shown. Scale bars: 10\u2009\u03bcm. (B) U\u20102 OS tomato\u2010AR cells were pretreated for 0.5\u2009h with 1\u2009\u03bcm TAS3681, enzalutamide, or bicalutamide, followed by treatment for 4\u2009h with the compounds in the presence of 0.1\u2009nm DHT in a steroid\u2010depleted medium and imaged with an imaging cytometer. The ordinate represents the ratio of fluorescent intensities of nuclear (shown as N) to cytoplasmic (shown as C) as the N/C ratio. Results are expressed as the mean of sextuplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. (C) The binding of AR on the enhancer of KLK3 or TMPRSS2 in VCaP cells treated for 4\u2009h with 3\u2009nm DHT alone versus 3\u2009nm DHT plus 10\u2009\u03bcm enzalutamide or 3\u2009nm DHT plus 10\u2009\u03bcm TAS3681 was analyzed by ChIP\u2010qPCR assay. Results are expressed as the mean of quadruplicate samples\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells using Wilcoxon test, #\nP\u2009<\u20090.05; ##\nP\u2009<\u20090.01 versus DHT\u2010treated cells using Dunnett's test. (D) Agonist activities of 10\u2009\u03bcm hydroxyflutamide, bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and 3\u2009\u03bcm TAS3681 against wild\u2010type or mutant ARs; HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vector of wild\u2010type or mutant AR and pGL4.36 luciferase plasmid and incubated for 1\u2009day. To analyze the T878A mutant AR, LNCaP cells were transfected with pGLPE luciferase plasmid and incubated for 1\u2009day. Each cell was treated with the indicated compounds in steroid\u2010depleted medium for 1\u2009day before luciferase activity measurements. Results are expressed as mean of sextuplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. #\nP\u2009<\u20090.05; ##\nP\u2009<\u20090.01; ###\nP\u2009<\u20090.001 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells using Dunnett's test. (E) Inhibitory effects of TAS3681, enzalutamide, and apalutamide on DHT\u2010induced proliferation of LNCaP (left panel) and F877L\u2010expressing LNCaP cells (right panel). The cells were incubated for 6\u2009days with various concentrations of TAS3681, enzalutamide, and apalutamide in the presence of 0.1\u2009nm DHT. The dashed line indicates cell viability in the absence of DHT. Results are expressed as mean of sextuplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. A representative experiment is shown. AR, androgen receptor; Bic, bicalutamide; Enz, enzalutamide; KLK3, kallikrein\u2010related peptidase 3; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease serine 2.TAS3681 potently and dose\u2010dependently blocked AR nuclear translocation in U\u20102 OS tomato\u2010AR cells stimulated with DHT (Fig.\u00a02B). Enzalutamide also showed dose\u2010dependent inhibition of AR nuclear translocation (Fig.\u00a02B). Conversely, bicalutamide showed little inhibition of AR nuclear translocation in those cells (Fig.\u00a02A,B). The IC50 of TAS3681 for blocking DHT\u2010induced AR nuclear translocation was estimated to be 63.7\u2009nm, whereas that of enzalutamide was 103\u2009nm (Table\u00a0S5). Bicalutamide did not suppress AR nuclear translocation (Table\u00a0S5). We also examined the effect of antiandrogens on AR subcellular localization in the absence of androgen. Nuclear translocation of AR was not observed after treating cells with TAS3681 or enzalutamide (Fig.\u00a0S6A). The N/C ratios of cells treated with 10\u2009\u03bcm TAS3681 or enzalutamide were calculated to be 1.360 and 1.325, respectively, which were similar to those of cells treated with DMSO indicating that TAS3681 and enzalutamide do not induce AR nuclear translocation and have a pure antagonist profile (Fig.\u00a0S6B). In contrast, nuclear translocation of AR was observed after the treatment of cells with 10\u2009\u03bcm bicalutamide, as previously reported. The N/C ratio of cells treated with bicalutamide was 1.858, indicating that bicalutamide induces AR nuclear translocation and has partial agonist activity (Fig.\u00a0S4B).Next, we examined the effect of TAS3681 on AR binding to DNA in PCa cells. ChIP\u2010qPCR assays revealed that AR was efficiently recruited to the enhancer regions of KLK3 and TMPRSS2 in VCaP cells in the presence of DHT. Treatment with TAS3681 or enzalutamide impaired the AR binding to these regions (Fig.\u00a02C). This finding suggests that TAS3681 blocks the nucleo\u2010cytoplasmic translocation of AR and DNA binding without any AR agonist activity.Mutations in the AR are known to promote resistance to antiandrogen therapies, including enzalutamide. AR mutations are more common in patients progressing to these therapies than in responders. The effects of antiandrogens on mutant ARs such as T878A, AR W742C, and AR F877L were studied using cell\u2010based transient transactivation assays with an androgen\u2010responsive luciferase reporter gene construct. In the absence of DHT, agonist mode transactivation assays showed that enzalutamide acted as an agonist for the AR F877L mutant, whereas bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide were agonistic for mutants AR W742C and AR T878A, respectively (Fig.\u00a02D). However, TAS3681 alone did not show agonistic profiles for all tested mutant ARs in the absence of DHT (Fig.\u00a02D). We obtained similar results by transactivation assays in the presence of DHT, and only TAS3681 functioned as a pure antagonist for all tested mutant ARs (Fig.\u00a0S7). Moreover, we expanded the list of functionally characterized AR\u2010LBD mutants with an additional 10 variants (mutated ARs L702H, V716M, W742L, H875Q, H875Y, D891Y, Q903H, H875Y/T878A, T878A/S889G, and T878A/D891H). In addition to the three AR mutations tested earlier, we evaluated the response of these 10 AR mutants to increasing concentrations of DHT to determine the optimal concentration for each AR mutant, following a process similar to that for other mutants. The effects of antiandrogens (TAS3681, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) on the transactivation of 13 AR mutants were studied, and IC50 values were calculated (Fig.\u00a0S8 and Table\u00a0S6). Enzalutamide and apalutamide showed agonistic effects on the mutated ARs F877L/T878A, H875Y/T878A, and F877L (Fig.\u00a0S8 and Table\u00a0S6). While darolutamide showed an agonistic effect on the mutated ARs V716M and H875Y, TAS3681 did not show an agonistic effect on any additional mutant ARs in this study (Fig.\u00a0S8 and Table\u00a0S6). Next, we investigated the effectiveness of TAS3681 in inhibiting the proliferation of LNCaP cells stably expressing F877L AR (F877L AR cells). TAS3681 treatment in the presence of DHT potently and dose\u2010dependently suppressed the proliferation of both the parent and F877L AR cells (Fig.\u00a02E). Enzalutamide and apalutamide suppressed the proliferation of parent cells but failed to suppress the proliferation of F877L AR cells at any concentration, as previously reported (Fig.\u00a02E). Taken together, these findings suggest that TAS3681 functions as an AR pure antagonist against wild\u2010type and clinically relevant LBD mutations.TAS3681 reduces both AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 protein levels and suppresses the proliferation of enzalutamide\u2010resistant PCa cellsSince TAS3681 showed AR reduction activity in a previous cell\u2010based study, we examined whether TAS3681 also reduces the expression of both AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. As shown in Fig.\u00a03A, Figs\u00a0S9 and S10, TAS3681 effectively and dose\u2010dependently reduced not only AR\u2010FL but also AR\u2010V7 in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. TAS3681 also reduced the protein levels of both ARs in 22Rv1 cells, another AR\u2010V7 positive enzalutamide\u2010resistant cell line (Fig.\u00a0S11). TAS3681 effectively and dose\u2010dependently suppressed the proliferation of SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells expressing AR and AR\u2010V7 (Fig.\u00a03B). In contrast, enzalutamide did not suppress the growth of SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells at any of the concentrations tested (Fig.\u00a03B).TAS3681 reduces both AR\u2010full length (AR\u2010FL) and AR\u2010splice variant 7 (AR\u2010V7) protein levels and suppresses the proliferation of enzalutamide\u2010resistant prostate cancer cells. (A) Downregulation of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs protein expression in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells exposed to TAS3681. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were exposed to TAS3681 or enzalutamide for 1\u2009day at the indicated concentrations. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for AR (N\u2010terminal) and GAPDH to confirm equal protein loading. Then, AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V proteins were detected by assessment of luminescence over a short or long period, respectively. A representative experiment (of 3) is shown. (B) Effects of TAS3681 (upper panel) and enzalutamide (lower panel) on the growth of SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were treated with TAS3681 or enzalutamide at the indicated concentrations for 3, 6, or 9\u2009days in an androgen\u2010free medium. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. (C) Effect of TAS3681 on AR\u2010V7\u2010related target genes in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were cultured under androgen\u2010deprived conditions for 1\u2009day and treated with DMSO or 7.5\u2009\u03bcm of TAS3681 or enzalutamide in the absence or presence of DHT for 1\u2009day. Total RNA was extracted from the cells, and cDNA was synthesized. The mRNA expression of UBE2C in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells was analyzed by RT\u2010qPCR analysis. The level of each target gene was normalized to the corresponding expression of GAPDH, and the relative mRNA expression in the DMSO\u2010treated cells without DHT was set as 1. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by Dunnett's test, #\nP\u2009<\u20090.05 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells in the absence of DHT; ##\nP\u2009<\u20090.01 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells in the presence of DHT. (D) Effect of TAS3681 on AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs protein levels in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells grown in androgen\u2010depleted medium were treated with TAS3681, enzalutamide, or vehicle control for 1\u2009day. Levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs were assessed by WB analysis. WB of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was performed with anti\u2010HDAC1 (nuclear) and anti\u2010\u03b2\u2010tubulin (cytoplasmic) antibodies to confirm successful cell fractionation. A representative experiment (of 3) is shown. (E) Evaluation of cPARP protein expression in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells by TAS3681, enzalutamide, or camptothecin. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TAS3681, enzalutamide, or camptothecin. Cell lysates were prepared following 1\u2009day of treatment and were subjected to immunoblotting for cPARP, as well as for GAPDH, to confirm equal loading. A representative experiment (of 2) is shown. AR, androgen receptor; cPARP, cleaved\u2010poly (ADP\u2010ribose) polymerase; Enz, enzalutamide; TAS, TAS3681; UBE2C, ubiquitin\u2010conjugating enzyme E2 C.Next, to examine whether TAS3681 affected the transcriptional activity of AR\u2010V7, real\u2010time qPCR analysis was conducted to quantify mRNA levels of AR\u2010V7\u2010dependent endogenous genes, including CDC20, CDK1, CCNA2, and UBE2C, in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. DHT did not affect the mRNA levels of the genes in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells (Fig.\u00a03C and Fig.\u00a0S8). TAS3681 considerably decreased the expression of AR\u2010V7 target genes in the presence and absence of DHT, whereas enzalutamide did not (Fig.\u00a03C and Fig.\u00a0S12). Next, to further explore the subcellular locations of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs, cytoplasmic and nuclear protein fractions of SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were analyzed. Under androgen\u2010depleted conditions, AR\u2010FL was detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas AR\u2010Vs were localized predominantly in the nucleus, as previously reported. TAS3681 reduced the expression of both AR\u2010Vs and AR\u2010FL within their respective localizations (Fig.\u00a03D). In contrast, enzalutamide did not affect the expression of AR\u2010Vs in the nucleus and that of AR\u2010FL in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.\u00a03D).The downregulation of AR\u2010V7 by antisense oligonucleotides is accompanied by suppression of androgen\u2010independent cell growth and apoptosis induction in PCa cells. We found through WB analysis that cPARP, an apoptosis\u2010related protein, was expressed in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells treated with TAS3681 (Fig.\u00a03E). In contrast, cPARP was not expressed after enzalutamide treatment (Fig.\u00a03E). Altogether, TAS3681 suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis accompanied by downregulation of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 in enzalutamide\u2010resistant SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells.TAS3681 reduces AR protein levels and suppresses AR transactivation and growth of AR\u2010overexpressing enzalutamide\u2010resistant cellsAndrogen receptor overexpression and amplification have been reported as mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance. Next, we examined the effect of AR overexpression on the AR inhibitory activity of TAS3681 and enzalutamide. VCaP cells transfected with the wild\u2010type AR showed higher AR protein levels, and as a result, AR transcriptional activation and proliferation were more efficiently enhanced by DHT in AR\u2010overexpressing cells than in parental cells (Fig.\u00a04A\u2013C). Enzalutamide completely blocked DHT\u2010induced AR transcriptional activation and proliferation in parental cells but did not completely suppress them in AR\u2010overexpressing cells (Fig.\u00a04A\u2013C). In contrast, TAS3681 effectively blocked DHT\u2010induced AR transcriptional activation and proliferation in both parental and AR\u2010overexpressing cells. These observations of TAS3681 were consistent with the attenuation of AR levels in AR\u2010overexpressing cells treated with TAS3681 (Fig.\u00a04A\u2013C). The addition of AR\u2010lowering effects to AR antagonists might be an effective strategy to address the issues of AR amplification and overexpression.TAS3681 reduces AR protein level and suppresses AR transactivation and the growth of AR\u2010overexpressing prostate cancer cells. (A) Effect of TAS3681 on AR protein levels in AR\u2010overexpressing VCaP cells. VCaP cells were transfected with a mock vector or an AR expression vector and treated with the indicated compounds (10\u2009\u03bcm) for 1\u2009day. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for AR and GAPDH to confirm equal loading. Numbers below the AR band indicate AR protein expression relative to that in DMSO control cells transfected with a mock vector. A representative experiment (of 3) is shown. (B) Effects of TAS3681 and enzalutamide on AR transcriptional activity in AR\u2010overexpressing VCaP cells. VCaP cells were transfected with a mock vector or an AR expression vector, and the pGL4.36 luciferase plasmid and incubated for 1\u2009day. The cells were treated with TAS3681 or enzalutamide at the indicated concentrations with 3\u2009nm DHT in steroid\u2010depleted medium for 1\u2009day before luciferase activity measurements. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. **P\u2009<\u20090.001 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells using Wilcoxon test, #\nP\u2009<\u20090.05; ##\nP\u2009<\u20090.01; ###\nP\u2009<\u20090.001 versus DHT\u2010treated cells using Dunnett's test, \u266d\u266d\nP\u2009<\u20090.01; \u266d\u266d\u266d\nP\u2009<\u20090.001 by Student's t\u2010test. (C) Effects of TAS3681 and enzalutamide on the growth of AR\u2010overexpressing VCaP cells. VCaP cells were transfected with a mock vector or AR expression vector, followed by incubation for 3\u2009days with TAS3681 or enzalutamide at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 0.3\u2009nm DHT. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. ***P\u2009<\u20090.001 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells using Student's t\u2010test, #\nP\u2009<\u20090.05; ##\nP\u2009<\u20090.01; ###\nP\u2009<\u20090.001 versus DHT\u2010treated cells using Dunnett's test, \u266d\nP\u2009<\u20090.05; \u266d\u266d\u266d\nP\u2009<\u20090.001 by Student's t\u2010test. AR, androgen receptor; Enz, enzalutamide.TAS3681 downregulates both AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 protein levels at the translational levelNext, we investigated whether the mechanism of AR downregulation by TAS3681 caused an increase in the rate of AR protein degradation or a decrease in AR protein synthesis. A CHX chase assay was used to analyze AR protein stability. Treatment of LNCaP cells with TAS3681 in the presence of CHX did not increase the rate of AR degradation as well as \u03b2\u2010actin degradation compared with the vehicle control, in contrast to HSP90 inhibitor 17\u2010AAG (Fig.\u00a05A and Fig.\u00a0S13). Next, we examined AR mRNA and protein levels in the presence of Act D, an inhibitor of mRNA synthesis. AR mRNA levels were evaluated by RT\u2010qPCR after treatment with TAS3681 in the presence of Act D. Treatment with TAS3681 did not significantly reduce AR mRNA level compared to vehicle treatment; therefore, TAS3681 did not affect AR mRNA stability (Fig.\u00a05B). The AR protein level was evaluated using WB analysis after the treatment of TAS3681 in the presence of Act D. The results showed that the AR protein level reduced over time after TAS3681 treatment (Fig.\u00a05C lower left panel and Fig.\u00a0S14). GAPDH protein expression did not decrease over time after TAS3681 treatment (Fig.\u00a05C lower right panel and Fig.\u00a0S14). Conversely, a non\u2010selective protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, promoted the reduction of both AR and GAPDH levels in the presence of Act D (Fig.\u00a05C upper panel and Fig.\u00a0S14). TAS3681 did not show significant effect on AR mRNA levels in LNCaP cells compared to the vehicle (Fig.\u00a0S15). Similarly, we investigated the mechanism of AR\u2010Vs and AR\u2010V7 downregulation by TAS3681 using SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. Treatment with TAS3681 did not prompt degradation of AR\u2010Vs protein in the presence of CHX. In the presence of Act D, AR\u2010V7 mRNA stability was not affected by TAS3681, while AR\u2010Vs protein level was reduced by TAS3681 compared to vehicle treatment (Fig.\u00a0S16A\u2013C). TAS3681 did not show significant effect on AR\u2010V7 mRNA levels in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells compared to the vehicle (Fig.\u00a0S17). Considering the present findings, it can be deduced that TAS3681 reduces the rates of AR and AR\u2010Vs protein synthesis.TAS3681 downregulates AR protein levels at the translational level. (A) Effect of TAS3681 and 17\u2010AAG on the stability of AR and \u03b2\u2010actin proteins in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were treated with TAS3681 at concentrations of 5 and 10\u2009\u03bcm or with 17\u2010AAG at a concentration of 1\u2009\u03bcm for 0, 4, 8, or 24\u2009h in the presence of CHX (10\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121). The expression levels of AR and \u03b2\u2010actin proteins were evaluated by WB analysis. The expression level of AR or \u03b2\u2010actin protein in the 0\u2009h sampling group was set to 1 to evaluate the relative expression of AR or \u03b2\u2010actin protein at each sampling time. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. (B) Effect of TAS3681 on the stability of AR mRNA in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were treated with TAS3681 at a concentration of 5 or 10\u2009\u03bcm for 0, 4, 8, or 24\u2009h in the presence of Act D (5\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121). The expression of AR mRNA was evaluated by RT\u2010PCR. The expression level of AR mRNA in the control group (0\u2009h sampling group) was set to 1 to evaluate the relative expression of AR mRNA at each sampling time. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. (C) Effect of TAS3681 and CHX on AR and GAPDH protein expression in LNCaP cells in the presence of Act D. LNCaP cells were treated with TAS3681 at a concentration of 5 and 10\u2009\u03bcm or with CHX at a concentration of 30\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 for 0, 4, 8, or 24\u2009h in the presence of Act D (5\u2009\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121). The expression of AR and GAPDH proteins was evaluated by WB analysis. Results are expressed as mean of triplicate wells\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. The expression levels of AR or GAPDH protein in the 0\u2009h sampling group were set to 1 to evaluate the relative expression of AR or GAPDH protein at each sampling time. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells using Student's t\u2010test; #\nP\u2009<\u20090.05, ##\nP\u2009<\u20090.01 versus DMSO\u2010treated cells using Dunnett's test.

The half\u2010life of TAS3681 in mice was not optimal (3.63\u2009h); therefore, TAS3681 was\u00a0orally dosed using bids. The ratios of the mean RTV in each TAS3681\u2010treated group (7.5, 15, or 22.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121) to those in the vehicle control group (T/C ratio, %) were 64%, 41%, and 24%, respectively. At all doses, the difference in the mean RTV between the vehicle group and each TAS3681 group was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.025) (Fig.\u00a06A and Fig.\u00a0S18). Tumor regression was observed in one of ten mice treated with 15\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 of TAS3681, and three of ten mice treated with 22.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 of TAS3681 (Fig.\u00a06B). Administration of TAS3681 caused a dose\u2010dependent decrease in serum PSA levels in castrated SCID mice bearing SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 tumors. At 15 and 22.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121 of TAS3681, the difference in mean fold PSA change from baseline after 14\u2009days of treatment between the vehicle group and both TAS3681 groups was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.025) (Fig.\u00a06C and Fig.\u00a0S19). In the present study, the expression of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs proteins in harvested tumors (on day 15) was analyzed by WB. As shown in Fig.\u00a06D and Fig.\u00a0S20, the expression of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs in xenograft tumors was dose\u2010dependently downregulated by TAS3681. Altogether, these results indicate that TAS3681 exerts significant antitumor effects against enzalutamide\u2010resistant PCa xenografts, accompanied by a reduction of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs levels in tumors.TAS3681 suppressed tumor growth in enzalutamide\u2010resistant prostate cancer xenograft in\u2009vivo. (A) Antitumor effect of TAS3681 in castrated SCID mice implanted with human prostate cancer SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of castrated SCID mice. Vehicle or TAS3681 (7.5, 15, or 22.5\u2009mg\u00b7kg\u22121\u00b7day\u22121) was administered orally twice a day for 14\u2009days. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM (n\u2009=\u200910). *P\u2009<\u20090.025, ***P\u2009<\u20090.0005 versus vehicle group using Williams' test. (B) Individual tumor progression with the administration of vehicle or TAS3681 in castrated SCID mice bearing human prostate cancer SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. Waterfall plots show tumor progression in each of the mice between days 1 and 15. A representative experiment (of 2) is shown. (C) Effect of TAS3681 on serum PSA levels in castrated SCID mice bearing SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 human prostate cancer xenografts. On days 1 or 15, blood was collected, and serum was prepared. The PSA ratio indicated a fold change from the baseline after 14\u2009days of treatment. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM (n\u2009=\u200910 mice in each group except for vehicle group; n\u2009=\u20099). A representative experiment (of 2) is shown. *P\u2009<\u20090.025 versus vehicle group using Williams' test. (D) Downregulation of AR\u2010FL (left) and AR\u2010Vs protein (right) expression in tumors of castrated SCID mice after treatment with TAS3681. Tumors were harvested on day 15, and tumor tissue lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for AR\u2010FL, AR\u2010Vs, and \u03b2\u2010actin. The expression of AR\u2010FL protein or AR\u2010Vs protein in tumor tissue was normalized to that of \u03b2\u2010actin, and the relative AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs expression in the vehicle\u2010treated group was set as 1. Results are expressed as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM (n\u2009=\u200910).

Remarkable progress has been made in targeting persistent AR activation with second\u2010generation hormonal therapies (enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate) in recent years, but resistance to these agents limits therapeutic efficacy in many patients. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutics. Several major resistance pathways are involved in androgen signaling, including AR overexpression and amplification, AR mutant expression, intratumoral and adrenal androgen production, and constitutively active AR\u2010V7. AR\u2010V7 has been reported to lack LBDs, be constitutively activated in an androgen\u2010independent manner, and correlate with poor prognosis. AR\u2010V7 is a constitutively active transcription factor that lacks the LBD but retains the N\u2010terminal and DNA\u2010binding domain; therefore, it can circumvent the limitations of current ARSIs that target the LBD. Hence, compounds that can simultaneously target AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 may provide novel strategies to overcome the resistance of cells to second\u2010generation ARSIs. In the present study, we report that TAS3681 is a novel small\u2010molecule compound that inhibits both AR\u2010FL and constitutively active AR\u2010V7 and overcomes resistance to enzalutamide therapy in CRPC in in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo models.AR\u2010V7 is rarely expressed in primary PCa but its expression is often observed following ADT, with further increase in expression following treatment with ARSIs. These findings were consistent with the observations using the experimental models. Expression of truncated AR\u2010Vs can be significantly upregulated after treatment with abiraterone in CRPC xenografts and has been observed in PCa cells after long\u2010term treatment with enzalutamide. In this study, we used SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells established from LNCaP xenograft tumors in castrated mice under continuous enzalutamide treatment. SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells express AR\u2010Vs including AR\u2010V7. Endogenous AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 function as proliferative drivers in SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells. In contrast to enzalutamide, TAS3681 effectively and dose\u2010dependently suppressed the growth of SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells and reduced the protein levels of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs including AR\u2010V7 in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo. Additionally, TAS3681 reduced both AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs protein levels in the nucleus, where they function as transcription factors. TAS3681 reduced the expression of AR\u2010FL\u2010regulated genes such as PSA and, more importantly, that of AR\u2010V7\u2010regulated genes, such as UBE2C and CDC20, whereas enzalutamide did not affect gene expression. Recently, several compounds have been found to affect AR\u2010Vs. EPI\u20107386 and UT\u2010155 are inhibitors of the N\u2010terminal domain of AR and block AR\u2010V7 activity\u00a0. An FDA\u2010approved anthelminthic drug, niclosamide, was previously identified as a downregulator of AR\u2010V7. These compounds exhibit a synergistic effect with enzalutamide and resensitize treatment\u2010resistant PCa cells to enzalutamide. Therefore, combining second\u2010generation ARSIs with AR\u2010V7 inhibitors could be an attractive strategy to overcome ARSI resistance in PCa. TAS3681 is a new class of second\u2010generation ARSIs that can simultaneously target both AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7. Therefore, TAS3681, as a mono\u2010therapy, could potentially overcome enzalutamide resistance. Drug\u2013drug interactions could also be avoided, along with any other adverse effects.Recent analyses of cell\u2010free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with mCRPC have shown that AR amplification is associated with resistance to second\u2010generation ARSIs. Consistent with these findings, increased expression of AR\u2010FL in PCa cells after treatment with ARSIs, including abiraterone and enzalutamide, has been reported in in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo models. For instance, two enzalutamide\u2010resistant sub\u2010lines (LAPC4 and DuCaP cells) established by long\u2010term enzalutamide exposure exhibited overexpressed AR\u2010FL and decreased sensitivity to enzalutamide. In the present study, we used VCaP cells transfected with an AR\u2010expressing vector as the AR\u2010overexpressing PCa cell model. VCaP cells exhibit endogenous AR amplification, but second\u2010generation ARSIs, including enzalutamide and darolutamide, are effective against the cells. This finding was reproduced in our study, and enzalutamide completely blocked DHT\u2010induced AR transcriptional activation and proliferation in VCaP cells. The ineffectiveness of enzalutamide in AR\u2010overexpressing VCaP cells by transfection with an AR\u2010expressing vector suggests that an increase in AR expression is a cause of enzalutamide resistance. TAS3681 uniquely reduced AR protein levels in cells and effectively blocked DHT\u2010induced AR transcriptional activation and cell proliferation in both parental and AR\u2010overexpressing cells. These results showed that TAS3681 is fully antagonistic to AR overexpression, probably through its AR\u2010reducing effect and AR pure antagonism. Further studies with different AR\u2010overexpressing models are necessary to consider the notable effects of TAS3681 in the future.Androgen receptor mutations in the LBD in response to ARSIs are a well\u2010known mechanism underlying therapeutic resistance. Although rarely observed in non\u2010metastatic castration\u2010sensitive patients, AR\u2010LBD mutations are frequently detected in heavily pretreated mCRPC patients, suggesting that they are advantageous to clonal propagation. TAS3681 is a pure antagonist of all the studied AR mutations that can lead to resistance to both first\u2010 and second\u2010generation ARSIs. In contrast to apalutamide and enzalutamide, TAS3681 antagonized the AR F877L mutation and suppressed the proliferation of F877L AR cells. Moreover, TAS3681 functioned as an antagonist of the double\u2010mutant ARs F877L/T878A and H875Y/T878A, conferring the activation of AR\u2010mediated transcription by enzalutamide and apalutamide. Recently, it was reported that the AR F877L mutation leads to enzalutamide and apalutamide resistance, as it converts them into agonists. Furthermore, enzalutamide acts as a weak partial agonist for AR F877L and a strong partial agonist for double\u2010mutant ARs F877L/T878A and H875Y/T878A. In the present study, darolutamide exhibited agonistic effects on the mutated ARs V716M and H875Y, as reported, whereas no significant agonist profile was observed with TAS3681. Both mutations have been identified in patients with CRPC, and V716M was identified in ctDNA collected at the time of resistance to abiraterone and bicalutamide. Therefore, TAS3681 functions as an AR pure antagonist against various clinically relevant AR mutations that are generated in response to treatment with antiandrogen. Our preclinical data support further evaluation of the clinical responses to TAS3681 in current second\u2010generation ARSI\u2010resistant CRPC patients.The balance between the rates of synthesis and proteasomal degradation of AR protein determines the steady\u2010state levels of AR protein in the cells. For example, HSP90 inhibitors increase the rate of degradation of AR protein by disrupting HSP90\u2010AR interaction that is essential for AR stability. In this study, TAS3681 did not increase the rate of AR degradation in the presence of CHX, suggesting that the mechanism of AR protein level reduction by TAS3681 does not involve enhanced protein degradation. In another experiment, TAS3681 reduced AR protein, but not AR mRNA levels, in the presence of Act D; moreover, TAS3681 did not show a significant effect on the transcription of AR. These findings suggest that TAS3681 reduced the rate of AR protein synthesis. A non\u2010selective protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, reduced both AR and GAPDH levels in the presence of Act D; however, TAS3681 did not promote the reduction of GAPDH under the same conditions, indicating that these two compounds downregulate AR protein by different mechanisms. The results of our studies also suggest that TAS3681 downregulates both AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 protein levels at the translational level. The co\u2010expression of AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 in the same cells has been explained by selective alternative AR splicing. Several splicing factors have been shown to selectively regulate AR\u2010V7 splicing without a significant impact on AR\u2010FL splicing in response to ADT. A second\u2010generation HSP90 inhibitor blocks mRNA splicing of AR\u2010V7 but not FL\u2010AR, and reduces AR\u2010V7 mRNA and protein levels. The alternative AR splicing is a major mechanism that affects the expression of FL\u2010AR and AR\u2010V7, but TAS3681 may not have an effect on it, because our results suggest that TAS3681 does not affect the mRNA expression levels of FL\u2010AR and AR\u2010V7. AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010V7 protein levels are also regulated by mRNA translation initiation, including cap\u2010dependent translational machinery. The potential mechanism should be the focus of future studies to elucidate the unique mechanism of action of TAS3681.This study has some limitations. Unfortunately, the in\u2009vitro PCa cell models mimicking the ARSI resistance often observed in clinical mCRPC were limited to SAS MDV No. 3\u201014 cells and VCaP cells in our study. Our results will be further validated as soon as new cell lines become available. Patient\u2010derived xenograft models of abiraterone\u2010 and enzalutamide\u2010resistant PCa could be a solution to these limitations.ConclusionIn summary, our experimental data indicate that TAS3681 is part of the next\u2010generation ARSIs, which antagonize various AR mutants that can lead to resistance to first\u2010 and second\u2010generation ARSIs. TAS3681 also has a unique AR\u2010FL and AR\u2010Vs downregulation activity, which is accompanied by an antitumor effect in AR\u2010V7 expressing enzalutamide\u2010resistant cells in\u2009vitro and in\u2009vivo. These biological profiles support TAS3681 as a potential therapeutic candidate against multiple resistance mechanisms of the AR pathway in patients with mCRPC who have progressed to treatment with second\u2010generation ARSIs. This compound is currently under clinical investigation in a phase I study of patients with mCRPC previously treated with\u00a0abiraterone acetate and/or enzalutamide (NCT02566772).Conflict of interestAll authors are employed at Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.Author contributionsKM conceptualized and designed the study.

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

These findings further validate the critical role of stromal uPAR in cancer progression and the potential of oncolytic viruses as anti-stromal agents.INTRODUCTIONThe tumor stroma plays a critical role in cancer biology. Tumor fibroblasts, macrophages, endothelial and inflammatory/immune cells contribute to different steps of cancer initiation, angiogenesis, progression and metastasis. Strategies targeting the tumor microenvironment have been investigated in the preclinical and clinical setting, and several stromal directed agents are currently approved for clinical use, such as antiangiogenic and immunotherapeutic drugs. Active investigation is being pursued to develop agents targeting macrophages, fibroblasts or immune suppressive cells.The oncolytic virotherapy field has expanded exponentially in the last decade, with an increasing number of viral vectors being moved from the bench to clinical trials, and recently, to clinical use. Among the novel oncolytic viruses under development, the Edmonston vaccine strain of measles virus (MV-Edm) is a promising one, whose in vitro and in vivo preclinical safety and efficacy are well established. Recombinant, non-targeted oncolytic MVs are currently being evaluated in ovarian cancer, brain tumors, multiple myeloma and mesothelioma, with promising preliminary reports of antitumor efficacy.The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a GPI anchored cell surface receptor, whose clinical and biological relevance are well established. It plays a critical role in tumor-stromal interactions, tumor progression and metastasis. Murine and human cancers overexpress uPAR, and it has been shown to be abundantly expressed in stromal cells, including tumor fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells, as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Therefore, the uPAR is an attractive target for tumor and stromal directed biological therapies.In an effort to develop stromal directed oncolytic viral vectors, our group has engineered and rescued oncolytic measles viruses fully retargeted against murine (MV-m-uPA) or human (MV-h-uPA) urokinase receptor (uPAR). Recombinant oncolytic MVs retargeted against human or mouse uPAR induce antitumor effects in primary (orthotopic) and metastatic tumors, in xenograft or syngeneic cancer models, respectively. As MV-m-uPA and MV-h-uPA are species specific, the above viral agents represent invaluable tools to dissect the contribution of stromal targeting on an oncolytic virus\u2019 antitumor effects. The current study is the first to characterize the in vitro, in vivo and molecular effects of stromal selective targeting by an oncolytic measles virus.MATERIALS AND METHODSVirus preparation, characterization, and cell cultureMV-GFP, MV-m-uPA and MV-h-uPA were generated as previously reported. Murine 4T1 (mammary carcinoma, ATCC #2539, purchased in 2007), CT-26 (colon carcinoma, ATCC #2638, purchased in 2009), NIH-3T3 (immortalized fibroblasts, ATCC #1658, purchased in 2009) and NMuMG (murine mammary epithelial, ATCC #1636, purchased in 2009), as well as human breast (MDA-MB-231, ATCC #HTB-26, purchased in 2007; T47D, ATCC #HTB-133; purchased in 2009) and colon cancer cells (HT-29, ATCC #HTB-38, purchased in 2012) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. HMEC (human mammary epithelial cells) were purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD) in 2009 and maintained in mammary epithelial cell growth medium (MEGM) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cancer associated fibroblasts CAF19 (from a luminal A tumor) and CAF23 (from a basal like tumor) were isolated and characterized from primary breast tumors in 2016, and maintained in Iscove\u2019s modified dulbecco\u2019s medium (IMDM).In vitro infection, assessment of virus induced cytotoxicity, and in vitro viral replication were performed as previously described.uPAR ImmunocytochemistryCells were plated in chamber slides (VWR, Radnor, PA) at 5\u00d7104 cells per chamber overnight, washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for one hour at room temperature. Following three times PBS washes, cells were blocked (3% BSA with 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS for one hour at room temperature) and probed with FITC conjugated anti-human uPAR (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or FITC conjugated anti-mouse uPAR antibody (1:100; Abcam), and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C. This was followed by three times PBS washes; slides were mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy.Generation of RFP expressing cellscDNA encoding RFP (pDsRed-Express Vector, Clontech, Mountain View, CA) were subcloned into the BamHI-NotI site of the lentiviral vector pHR-SIN-CSGWd1NotI (gift of Y. Ikeda, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Lentiviral packaging and virus transduction of cancer cells were performed as previously reported. Briefly, Lentiviral packaging was performed by cotransfection of the vector plasmid with pCMV-Gag-Pol vector and pCMV-VSVG-poly-A vector into 293T cells using CaCl2 transfection kit (Promega, Madison, WI). After 48 hours, lentivirus-containing supernatant was harvested, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Cells were infected with RFP expressing lentiviral vector in a 6-well plate. 24 hours post-infection, fresh growth media were replaced.In vitro fibroblast-to-cancer cell viral transferFibroblasts (CAF19, CAF23, NIH-3T3)were incubated with species specific uPAR retargeted MVs, which express eGFP (MOI of 1) in Opti-MEM for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Free viruses were then removed and cells were maintained in the appropriate medium. To rule out persistence of cell free virions, 100\u00a0\u03bcl of the last wash was inoculated on Vero monolayers. Cells were cultured in the presence of 80 \u03bcg/ml fusion inhibitory peptide (Bachem California, Torrance, CA) to block syncytia formation. Virus infected fibroblasts were overlaid on RFP-expressing tumor cells. Mixed (double-color) syncytia were demonstrated at different periods of incubation by fluorescent microscopy.In vitro 3-D collagen co-culture modelThree-dimensional collagen gel co-culture was established based on a method described previously. Briefly, 3T3 cells were infected with MV-m-uPA at MOI = 3 in Opti-MEM for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C, followed by virus removal. RFP expressing T47D cells and 3T3 cells were mixed at a ratio of 2:1 and cultured on collagen type I gel (concentration: 1.3mg/ml). At different time points, cells were released from the collagen gel by collagenase treatment (2mg/ml, Worthington). After washing with PBS, samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur benchtop cytometer (BD Biosciences) for quantification of RFP expressing cells.Animal studiesAnimal studies were approved by the University of Miami Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight to 10 week old female NSG mice were injected with 2\u00d7106 MDA-MB-231 cells into the 5th mammary fat pad. When tumors reached 0.4\u20130.5 cm, mice (n = 8/group) were treated with PBS or 1.5\u00d7106 TCID50 of MV-m-uPA, via tail vein 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Tumor volume was measured/calculated twice a week as reported. Clinical signs of toxicity were monitored. Animals were followed until they reached sacrifice criteria (when tumor burden reached 10% of body weight, tumor ulceration occurred or mice became moribund). For correlative studies, tumor bearing mice (n = 3/group) were treated with two intravenous injections of 1.5\u00d7106 TCID50 of MV-m-uPA or vehicle, and tumors were resected after 24 or 72 hours of the last injection, and snap frozen.In additional experiments, NOD/SCID were implanted with MDA-MB-231 cells as above. When tumors reached a diameter of 0.4\u20130.5 cm, animals (n = 8/group) were treated with 1.5\u00d7106 TCID50 of MV-m-uPA, MV-h-uPA, combination of MV-m-uPA and MV-h-uPA (1.5\u00d7106 TCID50 for each of virus) or equal volumes of PBS via tail vein every other day for a total of 3 treatments. Tumor evaluation was conducted as above. For correlative studies, tumor bearing mice (n = 3) were given two intravenous injections of 1.5\u00d7106 TCID50 of MV-h-uPA, MV-m-uPA or vehicle. Tumors were resected at day 2 and 5 after the last injection, and snap frozen.Virus RecoveryTissues were weighed and homogenized in three volumes (w/v) of Opti-MEM utilizing mechanical crushing and a single freeze thaw cycle. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation and ten-fold serial dilutions of samples were prepared in Opti-MEM. Aliquots (50 \u03bcL) of each dilution were placed in 96 well plates containing Vero-his cells and TCID50 titrations were performed. Viral titers are displayed as TCID50/ml and were normalized for gram of tissue. Lower limit of detection was 84 TCID50/ml.Viral RNA quantificationTotal RNA was extracted from frozen specimens using the RNeasy tissue mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). qRT-PCR for MV-N mRNA was performed as previously reported.Hematology and chemistry analysisWhole blood and serum were harvested from mice at specific timepoints, and host toxicity was evaluated by assessment of changes in hematological and biochemical parameters using a Hemavet 1700 multispecies hematology analyzer and an Ortho Vitros 250 analyzer, respectively.Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assayTo detect and visualize apoptosis, slides were washed twice with PBS (after fixation), permeabilized with 0.2% TritonX-100 for 20 minutes at room temperature and after 2 additional washes with PBS, sections were probed with label solution (for negative controls) or TUNEL reaction mix, following manufacturer\u2019s instructions (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit-TMR red; Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).In situ hybridizationIn situ RNA hybridization was performed from cryopreserved (8\u201310 \u03bcm) tumor sections using RNAscope technology, using RNA probes for murine uPAR (RNAscope Probe- Mm-Plaur) and measles virus N gene (RNAscope Probe-V-MEV-N-C2) from Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Newark,\u00a0California), following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Fluorescent signal was visualized and captured using an open-field Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U microscope. According Advanced Cell Diagnostics, each mRNA molecule hybridized to a probe appears as a separate small fluorescent dot.\u202cImmunofluorescence studiesTumor bearing mice (n = 3) were treated with two intravenous injections of 1.5\u00d7106 TCID50 of PBS, MV-m-uPA, MV-h-uPA. Mice were sacrificed and tumors resected after 48 hours of the last injection for immunofluorescence studies. Tissue samples were collected and frozen, and cryostat sections were fixed in cold acetone for 10 min. The slides were washed in PBS and incubated with anti-MV-nucleoprotein-FITC antibody (1:100; Chemicon International), or anti-Ki 67 antibody-FITC (1:100; Abcam) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Followed by three PBS washes, slides were mounted with anti-fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). For fibroblast co-immunofluorescence staining, the MV nucleoprotein positive slides were washed in PBS and incubated with anti-ER-TR7 primary antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After two washes, Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rat IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was applied (1:500; for 1 hour at room temperature). For costaining FAP, the MV nucleoprotein positive slides were incubated with anti-FAP antibody(1:100; Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After two washes, Alexa Fluor 594 anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was applied (1:500; for 1 hour at room temperature). Slides were mounted with anti-fade mounting medium after three PBS washes and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy.Nanostring analysis of Gene expressionTwo commercially available 770-gene panels (nCounter Human PanCancer Patwhways and mouse nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling were used to analyze human and murine genes. Assays were performed following manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with standard input of 100 ng and the codeset with the current XT chemistry using a\u00a0nanoString\u00a0nCounter Gen2 scanner and Prep-Station (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA). \u00a0 Samples were verified by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using Nano 6000 chips to determine RNA integrity number (RIN). Data were exported from NanoString\u2019s nCounter Raw Code Count Collector tool and loaded into R environment (v3.2.4) for analysis. Data normalization was performed using R package NanoStringNorm (v1.1.21), with a combination of multiple normalization steps, as previously reported. To minimize possible human-murine cross-hybridization, human (n=58) and mouse (n=10) orthologous genes with high sequence similarity (>=94%) were excluded from further downstream analysis.For differential expression analysis, R package limma (v3.26.9) was used to perform two group comparison test, and raw p values based on empirical Bayes moderated t-statistics were adjusted for multiple testing with Benjamini & Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Pathway enrichment and functional analyses were generated using QIAGEN\u2019s Ingenuity\u00ae Pathway Analysis (IPA\u00ae, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).Statistical analysisIn vitro data are presented as means +/\u2212 SD. Results from in vivo studies are shown as means +/\u2212 SEM. All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate unless otherwise specified. Statistical analysis among groups was performed by ANOVA, and sub-group comparisons were made the Student t-test, Tukey-Kramer, Fisher\u2019s or Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate. Overall survival was analyzed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and differences were analyzed by the log-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05, with adjustements for multiple comparisons as appropriate. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTSDifferential in vitro tumor and species selectivity of human vs. murine uPAR retargeted measles virusesHuman and murine cancer cells known to express uPAR, as well as (human) HMEC and (murine) NMuMG non-cancer cells were exposed to non-targeted MV (MV-GFP), MV-h-uPA and MV-m-uPA. As expected, from prior reports by us, MV-h-uPA and MV-m-uPA infected human MDA-MB 231 and murine 4T1 tumor cells in a species specific manner, while non-cancer epithelial cells (HMEC, NMuMG) were not susceptible to viral infection (Fig. 1). Similar species specific effects were observed in human HT-29 and T47D, as well as murine CT-26 cancer cells. As previously reported, MV-h-uPA was more selective to human cancer than non-cancer epithelial cells (HMEC) than MV-GFP.In vitro effects of uPAR retargeted viruses on cancer associated fibroblastsCancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express uPAR and play a critical role in tumor progression and metastasis. Patient derived CAF 19 and CAF 23, as well as murine 3T3 fibroblasts, express human and murine uPAR, respectively (Fig. 2. A). Human CAFs were permissive to MV-h-uPA but not to MV-m-uPA infection (Fig. 2. A). On the other hand, 3T3 cells were permissive only to murine, but not human uPAR retargeted viral vector (Fig 2. A). Viral replication was demonstrated in both human and murine fibroblasts at 24, 48 and 72 hours (Fig. 2. B). Human and murine uPAR retargeted MVs induced significant cytotoxitiy to species specific fibroblasts (Fig. 2. C).Effects of fibroblast targeting by MV-uPA on fibroblast-tumor cell interactionsNext, the ability of MV-uPA infected fibroblasts to transfer viral infection to tumor cells was determined. Human CAF 19 were infected by MV-h-uPA and subsequently overlaid onto RFP expressing MDA-MB 231 (Fig 3. A. I) or HT 29 (Fig. 3. A, II). At 48 hours, yellow fluorescent syncytia (GFP and RFP on overlay images) were observed, indicating successful viral transfer from CAFs to tumor cells via heterofusion. Similar results were observed when murine 3T3 cells were infected with species specific MV-m-uPA and overlaid onto RFP expressing 4T1 (Fig. 3. B, I) or CT-26 cells (Fig. 3. B, II).To evaluate the effects of fibroblast targeting by MV-uPA on cancer cell growth, a murine fibroblast/human cancer cell 3D coculture model was used, where permissive murine 3T3 cells were infected by MV-m-uPA and then co-cultured with RFP expressing human T47D cells, resistant to the murine virus (Fig 1, and 3. C). Growth of T47D mono- and co-cultures was quantitated by FACS of RFP positive cancer cells at days 1, 4, and 7. Growth of T47D in co-culture with 3T3s was significantly increased at day 4 and 7, compared to mono-cultures (Fig. 3. D). In contrast, MV-m-uPA infection of 3T3 cells led to significant inhibition of co-cultured T47Ds at similar time points.In vivo effects of stromal selective targeting by oncolytic MV-uPA in breast cancer xenograftsTo test the hypothesis that stromal selective targeting by MV-m-uPA is associated with tumor growth delay, the human MDA-MB 231 orthotopic breast cancer model was used, where human tumor cells are resistant to MV-m-uPA infection (Fig. 1), while murine stromal cells are expected to be susceptible to the murine virus via mouse uPAR (Figs. 2, 3). Tumor bearing mice were treated and followed as in methods. MV-m-uPA treatment was associated with a significant delay in tumor progression, compared to vehicle treated mice. Tumor growth in MV-m-uPA treated mice was inhibited by 53% at day 28 (p < 0.0001, Fig. 4. A). These effects were associated with a significant prolongation of survival (p= 0.001, Log rank test) in MV-m-uPA treated mice, compared to controls (60-day survival: 90% vs. 30%, Fig. 4. B).Tumor studies performed in additional (3 per group) mice treated with 2 doses of the virus demonstrated increasing viral RNA (Fig. 4.C.I) as well as viable viral particles (Fig. 4. C. II) over time. While viral RNA was detected in all tumor samples (3/3) in each time point, viable viral particles were identified only in 1/3 (day 1) and 2/3 (day3) tumor samples after virus administration. Moreover, MV-N protein (Fig. 4. D). was identified in tumors treated with intravenous MV-m-uPA. As MV-m-uPA does not bind to human tumor cells, the above findings strongly suggest successful in vivo stromal targeting by MV-m-uPA after systemic administration.Next, to determine the in vivo effects of targeting cancer vs stromal cell components of the tumor, MDA-MB231 bearing mice were treated (n=8 per group) with either vehicle, MV-m-uPA, MV-h-uPA or the combination (MV-m-uPA+MV-h-uPA). All treatment groups were associated with significant delay in tumor growth compared to controls (Fig. 5. A; p< 0.0001). While treatment with MV-h-uPA led to better effects than MV-m-uPA, the combination group was associated with improved tumor control compared to MV-h-uPA (35.5% reduction in tumor volume by day 28; p= 0.0332). No treatment related deaths were observed, and virus treatment was not associated with significant changes in hematology or biochemical parameters (table S1).In correlative tumor studies (n=3 per group) performed at days 2 and 5 after treatment with MV-h-uPA and MV-m-uPA, viral RNA was detected in all treated mice at both time points (Fig. 5,B), with higher copy numbers observed in tumors treated with the human uPAR retargeted virus (Fig. 5. B. I). Likewise, titers of viable virus were higher in the MV-h-uPA treated group (Fig 5. B. II). More tumors treated with MV-h-uPA had viable viral particles recovered (2/3 at day 2 and 3/3 at day 5) compared to MV-m-uPA treated tumors (1/3 in both days 2 and 5).Apoptosis (TUNEL) was significantly increased at days 2 (Fig. 5. C. I) and 5 (Fig. 5. C. II) in tumors treated with both MV-m-uPA and MV-h-uPA, with a higher percentage of TUNEL positive nuclei observed in tumors treated with the human retargeted virus. While tumor proliferation (Ki67) was not significantly altered by either virus at day 2, a significant decrease in Ki67 staining was observed in tumors treated by MV-h-uPA only at day 5 (Fig 5. C. IV, 5.D).To further characterize MV-m-uPA distribution within the tumor, in situ hybridization was performed to co-localize viral (MV-N) and stromal (murine uPAR) RNA. Immunofluorescence was also performed to evaluate the distribution of MV-N in relation with murine tumor fibroblasts. As shown in figure 6 A (and Figure S-1), Viral RNA (MV-N, red) co-localized with murine uPAR RNA (green) in MV-m-uPA treated tumors, but not in controls. Immunofluorescence studies showed co-localization of MV-N protein in murine FAP+ and ER-TR7+ stromal cells (Fig. 6. B, C).Effects of MV-m-uPA on murine and human gene expressionAnalysis was performed on tumor RNA at days 2 and 5 after virus treatment, using the nCounter Pancancer pathways (human) and (murine) Pancancer immune profiling panels (which encompass murine inflammation and stromal related genes). Time dependent differential expression of murine and human genes were observed in tumors treated by MV-m-uPA. Figure 7 shows heat maps of the top 100 significantly (p \u2264 0.05) differentially expressed murine (Fig 7.A, B) and human (Fig. 7. C, D) genes, as well as fold change of the top 20 genes, comparing MV-m-uPA treated tumors vs controls. Pathway analysis of significantly differentially expressed (\u2265 1.2 fold and p \u2264 0.05) murine (stromal) genes showed that MV-m-uPA significantly modulated genes associated with inflammatory responses, angiogenesis, as well as survival pathways (Table S-2 and S-3). Examples of differentially upregulated stromal genes at day 2 include Fez1 and Pycard, which negatively regulate cell proliferation/differentiation and mediate inflammation induced apoptosis, respectively. Angiogenesis related mouse genes were found to be down regulated, such as DLL-4, Angiopoietin 2, PECAM and Tie-1 (Fig 7.A and Table S-2). Other significantly down regulated genes that play a role in regulation of stromal cell components include FOS, EGR2, CREB-5, IL-6, Map2K1, among others (table S-1). At day 5, genes such as CCL22, TIMD4 and CCL19, associated with macrophage networks were significantly down regulated.Among the top differentially regulated human genes at day 2, down regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway genes (TCF-3, DKK1, WNT3 and WIF1) was observed, as well as down regulation of proliferation and survival genes, such as FOS, SSX1, TNF, leptin receptor, among others (Table S-4). NGFR (p75), which has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers was among the most upregulated human genes at days 2 and day 5. At day 5, significant down regulation of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin (GPC4, WNT 3, DKK1, WNT 7B), TGF beta (ACVR1C, INHBB, BMPR1B, SMAD3), JAK/Stat (JaK3, IL20RA), and Notch (JAG2) pathway genes was observed (figure 7. D, and Table S-5).DISCUSSIONOncolytic viral agents offer great hope as novel strategies for cancer treatment, both alone, or in combination with other treatment modalities. An important, but not well studied area in the field is the understanding of the biological effects of oncolytic viruses in the tumor microenvironment, which plays a critical role in cancer progression. While it has been previously shown that tumor-stromal cross-talk modulates the sensitivity of cancer cells to oncolytic virues, ours is the first report, to our knowledge, to investigate the direct effect(s) of a stromal selective oncolytic viral vector on in vivo tumor progression. The current study differs from previous publications in that other reports have investigated the additional direct or indirect effects of targeted or armed oncolytic viruses (which primarily infect cancer cells) on other stromal components, especially the tumor vasculature.The novel findings presented in the current study include the demonstration of successful viral infection, replication and cytotoxicity in human cancer associated fibroblasts and mouse 3T3 cells, as well as successful fibroblast to tumor cell viral transfer. Importantly, 3T3 selective targeting by MV-m-uPA inhibited paracrine growth of (virus insensitive) cancer cells in co-cultures. These results, which indicate that stromal specific targeting by an oncolytic virus regulates cancer cell growth, were validated in vivo, where intravenous administration of the murine specific MV-m-uPA (which does not infect human cancer cells) led to significant tumor growth delay and improved survival. In vivo tumor targeting was demonstrated by detection of viable virus, viral RNA and viral protein in treated tumors. Targeting of murine stroma by MV-m-uPA was confirmed by demonstrating co-localization of MV and mouse specific uPAR (the target of MV-m-uPA) RNA by in situ hybridization of treated tumors, as well as by co-localization of fibroblast markers and MV-N in treated tumors (by immunofluorescence). The above findings, and the fact that MV-m-uPA specifically infects murine, and not human cells, lead us to conclude that the in vivo antitumor effects of MV-m-uPA in MDA-MB 231 xenografts are due to stromal selective targeting, and that murine tumor fibroblasts are a target of the virus. Previously, we have demonstrated tumor endothelial targeting by the uPAR retargeted virus after systemic administration.Experiments comparing the effects of (murine) stromal versus human (cancer cell), versus combined targeting showed that targeting both tumor and stroma was associated with improved tumor control. This further validates the concept that stromal targeting represents an important strategy for biological therapies in general, and oncolytic viruses in particular. The improved effects by the human uPAR redirected virus compared to the murine targeted virus could -in part- be explained by the fact that in xenograft models, the (human) cancer cells are the predominant component of the tumor, while host stromal cells represent a smaller fraction, therefore reducing the reach and efficacy of the stromal targeted virus. This was supported by the observation of increased viable virus and increased viral RNA titers in tumors treated by the human uPAR retargeted virus than the murine retargeted virus. However, it also suggests that stromal targeting by itself (at least in this model) is not sufficient to achieve long term antitumor effects. The above results open the door for further research combining stromal targeted viruses with standard or experimental antitumor agents that target the cancer cell component for therapeutic gain.Correlative tumor studies showed that the antitumor effects of the stromal targeted virus were associated with increased apoptosis, as shown by TUNEL assay. Tumor cell proliferation, as measured by Ki67 determination was significantly decreased only in tumors treated by the human, but not the mouse uPAR retargeted virus. Targeted analysis of gene expression showed that important murine stromal pathways were affected, including pathways associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, viral infection, as well as survival/cell death. This provides insight into the mechanisms explaining how in vivo specific targeting of the tumor stromal component induces tumor delaying effects. Specifically, the data suggest that endothelial and fibroblast targeting contribute to the in vivo effects. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that other stromal cells that express uPAR, such as macrophages or other inflammatory cells may not play an important role in the in vivo observations. Studies elucidating the degree to which virus targeting of specific stromal components (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages) contribute to the in vivo effects observed in the current model, as well as characterizing the stromal cell-virus-tumor cell interactions are underway.The observation that MV-murine-uPA indirectly regulates human cancer pathways, provides important knowledge into the molecular mechanisms explaining how virus mediated stromal targeting directly affects stromal components, and indirectly modulates tumor cell behavior, resulting in antitumor effects. Studies aimed at further characterizing the mechanisms of stromal targeting on WNT, Jak-STAT and NOTCH pathways in cancer cells are under way, and will provide important information into the mechanisms of tumor stromal interactions that go beyond the oncolytic virus field.In summary, this report demonstrates for the first time that in vivo stromal selective targeting by an oncolytic virus, after systemic administration, is feasible, associated with differential regulation of stromal associated genes, modulation of tumor-stromal interactions, and in vivo tumor delaying effects. The above results validate the concept of uPAR as a biologically relevant target for oncolytic virotherapy and the potential of oncolytic viruses as antistromal agents, both alone, and in combination with other antitumor agents.Supplementary MaterialThis is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

Antibodies that block IFN receptors reduced CAF-dependent chemoprotection.ConclusionsCAF-induced activation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBCs results in chemoresistance. Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

        "content": "The generation of vascular stroma is essential for solid tumor growth and involves stimulatory and inhibiting factors as well as stromal components that regulate functions such as cellular adhesion, migration, and gene expression. In an effort to obtain a more integrated understanding of vascular stroma formation in breast carcinoma, we examined expression of the angiogenic factor vascular permeability factor (VPF)/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); the VPF/VEGF receptors flt-1 and KDR; thrombospondin-1, which has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis; and the stromal components collagen type I, total fibronectin, ED-A+ fibronectin, versican, and decorin by mRNA in situ hybridization on frozen sections of 113 blocks of breast tissue from 68 patients including 28 sections of breast tissue without malignancy, 18 with in situ carcinomas, 56 with invasive carcinomas, and 8 with metastatic carcinomas. A characteristic expression profile emerged that was remarkably similar in invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and metastatic carcinoma, with the following characteristics: strong tumor cell expression of VPF/VEGF; strong endothelial cell expression of VPF/VEGF receptors; strong expression of thrombospondin-1 by stromal cells and occasionally by tumor cells; and strong stromal cell expression of collagen type I, total fibronectin, ED-A+ fibronectin, versican, and decorin. The formation of vascular stroma preceded invasion, raising the possibility that tumor cells invade not into normal breast stroma but rather into a richly vascular stroma that they have induced. Similarly, tumor cells at sites of metastasis appear to induce the vascular stroma in which they grow. We conclude that a distinct pattern of mRNA expression characterizes the generation of vascular stroma in breast cancer and that the formation of vascular stroma may play a role not only in growth of the primary tumor but also in invasion and metastasis.",

The SEMG of tibialis anterior (TA) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) were collected bilaterally during walking. The peak root mean square (RMS-peak), RMS-peak time, mean power frequency (MPF), and median frequency (MF) were analyzed. A diagnostic model based on SEMG parameters using RF algorithm was established to locate compressed nerve root, and repeated reservation experiments were conducted for verification. The study evaluated the diagnostic efficiency of the model using accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1-score, Kappa value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.ResultsThe results showed that delayed activation of TA and decreased activation of LG were observed in the L5 group, while decreased activation of LG and earlier activation of LG were observed in the S1 group. The RF model based on eight SEMG parameters showed an average accuracy of 84%, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.93. The RMS peak time of TA was identified as the most important SEMG parameter.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the RF model can assist in the localization diagnosis of compressed nerve roots in LDH patients, and the SEMG parameters can provide further references for optimizing the diagnosis model in the future.1. IntroductionLumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common cause of low back pain and lower limb neuralgia. The highest incidence of LDH occurs at the L4/5 and L5/S1 levels, with most patients experiencing radiculopathy involving a single nerve root, typically the L5 or S1 root.At present, clinical symptoms, physical examination and imaging findings are usually combined to determine the diagnosis of LDH and the corresponding nerve root compression. However, LDH is a disease in which physical examination, symptoms and imaging findings are not always reliable or correlated. Previous studies have found that the ability to diagnose radiculopathy caused by LDH is not ideal either by physical examination alone or by isolated imaging findings. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard to evaluate the structural relationship between intervertebral disc, surrounding soft tissue and nerve tissue. However, MRI is usually performed in the resting state, which cannot monitor and evaluate the compression and functional states during movement. Several studies have found that many people without neurological symptoms exhibit positive MRI signs, and the accuracy of MRI in the diagnosis of compressed nerve roots is also lower. Therefore, there is a need to explore other means to support the localization diagnosis of LDH from a functional perspective.Surface electromyography (SEMG) is a prevalent tool for functional assessment, enabling real-time, quantitative evaluation, and analysis of an individual\u2019s dynamic neuromuscular function. Prior research has illuminated the neuromuscular function alterations following LDH from various perspectives. LDH patients typically exhibit diminished muscle strength and endurance, weakness in certain lower limb muscles, and fatigue in lumbar muscles. Moreover, studies have posited that LDH patients with differing nerve root compressions display distinct EMG characteristics. Our study aimed to delve further into the application of SEMG parameters in diagnosing LDH patients. However, additional exploration is required to analyze synchronous gait and SEMG changes, summarize muscle activation patterns, and more accurately classify and identify these patterns in patients with different nerve root compression. In this study, we concentrated on the tibialis anterior (TA) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscles, because these muscles exhibited significant alterations in their SEMG characteristics in LDH patients with L5 and S1 nerve root compression. In instances of L5 nerve root compression, neurological control disorders are primarily observed in the TA. Conversely, in cases of S1 nerve root compression, these disorders are predominantly exhibited by the LG. These observations suggest that when a specific nerve root is compressed, the functional state of the muscles primarily innervated by that nerve root changes.Machine learning, a novel data processing method, can extract valuable information from vast amounts of data through learning and training, and construct effective prediction models. Random forest (RF) is a potent method that has found extensive application in the medical field. Machine learning has been employed in gait recognition, robot rehabilitation, motion control, among other fields. Therefore, our aim is to analyze the SEMG characteristics of LDH patients with different compressed nerve roots, summarize muscle activation regularity, establish an RF diagnostic model, and verify its diagnostic efficiency. By doing so, we aspire to provide a fresh approach for the localization diagnosis of LDH.2. Materials and methods2.1. ParticipantsA total of 58 patients with LDH scheduled for lumbar decompression were recruited for this study from the Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital, Capital Medical University in Beijing, China. There were 29 patients with L4/5 herniation combined with L5 nerve root compression (L5 group), and 29 patients with L5/S1 herniation combined with S1 nerve root compression (S1 group). Thirty healthy adults (Healthy group) without previous neurological or musculoskeletal diseases or surgery were recruited as a control group. The sample size was preliminary estimated using G*Power 3.1 software.1 Based on the results of a pilot study, the effect size was set at 1.06, the significance level at two-tailed \u03b1 = 0.05, and the statistical power at 0.95, which indicated that a sample size of 24 was required. Considering the possible dropout rates and other uncertainties, 30 participants were planned for each group. However, one participant in each patient group was unable to complete the experiment due to personal reasons. Inclusion criteria for patients with LDH: (1) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LDH with sciatic radicular pain; (2) herniated disc segments requiring MRI and surgical confirmation; (3) compressed nerve roots limited to L5 or S1 nerve roots; (4) indications for surgery and the need for surgical treatment; and (5) no contraindication to neurophysiology and can undergo SEMG. LDH patients with the following symptoms were excluded: (1) pacemaker or any other metal implant in the body; (2) related or other peripheral nerve diseases and abnormal motor fiber conduction; (3) spastic paralysis or other muscle diseases of lower limb muscles, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy; (4) previous history of spinal surgery; (5) clinical manifestations of lumbar spinal stenosis; and (6) combined with other serious diseases, such as severe cardiopulmonary disease, defined as a condition that requires continuous oxygen therapy or hospitalization for respiratory failure.Healthy controls with the following symptoms were excluded: (1) abnormal gait due to congenital skeletal deformity or neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis; (2) lower extremity degenerative diseases and clinical symptoms, such as osteoarthritis or peripheral arterial disease, which affect walking function; (3) pregnant or perinatal women; and (4) suffering from other diseases that affect walking and daily activities, such as severe heart failure or end-stage renal disease.Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain scores and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores (JOA) were obtained for all patients and the general characteristics of all subjects are shown in Table 1. Although MRI has some diagnostic limitations and does not guarantee 100% diagnostic accuracy, in current clinical practice it is still the primary basis for the localized diagnosis of nerve root compression in LDH. In the present study, patients were initially enrolled by physician examination, special examination, clinical symptoms, and MRI diagnosis, subjected to SEMG testing and further confirmed by surgery. MRI of a typical patient with nerve root compression is shown in Figure 1. No participants had neuroelectrophysiological contraindication. All subjects signed informed consent, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Rehabilitation Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.General characteristics of subjects.\tL5 group\tS1 group\tHealthy group\t \tNumber of people\t29\t29\t30\t \tMale: female\t18:11\t18:11\t19:11\t \tAge (years)\t39.90 \u00b1 15.18\t41.86 \u00b1 13.36\t37.40 \u00b1 14.70\t \tHeight (cm)\t171.79 \u00b1 10.30\t169.59 \u00b1 8.72\t170.90 \u00b1 8.88\t \tBody weight (kg)\t77.38 \u00b1 16.10\t70.69 \u00b1 8.96\t70.07 \u00b1 16.44\t \tBMI\t26.09 \u00b1 4.11\t24.56 \u00b1 2.24\t23.87 \u00b1 4.59\t \tLeg pain (VAS)#\t8 (5, 9)\t7 (6, 8)\t/\t \tLow back pain (VAS)#\t1 (2, 6)\t1 (0, 3)\t/\t \tJOA score#\t12 (6.5, 15)\t13 (10, 14)\t/\t \t#Data does not follow normal distribution and is expressed as median (interquartile range).(A) Magnetic resonance imaging axial planes in patients with L4/L5 nerve root compression.

InstrumentSurface electromyography signals were measured by DELSYS wireless dynamic EMG tester (Trigno\u2122 Wireless Systems, Delsys Inc., USA, Figure 2D). The electrodes were placed on the surface of the muscle belly. Its sampling frequency is up to 2,000 Hz, transmission range is 20 m, and it can detect up to 16 muscles at the same time. The SEMG signal was synchronized with an 8-camera 3D motion capture system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) and two embedded force platforms (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) to divide gait cycles (Figure 2C). The gait cycle was defined using a heel strike frame on the force platform. The Vicon system and force measurement platform had sampling frequencies of 100 and 1,000 Hz, respectively. The Vicon system used a Plug-in gait model with 16 markers to define the body segments.(A) Frontal view of the test. (B) Lateral view of the test. (C) Gait and SEMG capture interface. (D) Trigno\u2122 Wireless Systems.2.2.2. Measurement methodsThe tests in this study were conducted in a dedicated room with a clean, distraction-free environment. Participants wore close-fitting, non-black, and non-reflective clothing to minimize capture errors. Prior to testing, the skin of the bilateral TA and LG muscles was cleaned and prepared. According to the guidelines established by the Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) project,2 the collection electrodes of the Delsys wireless dynamic EMG tester were strategically positioned on the most prominent portions of TA and LG muscles on both sides (Figures 2A, B). The EMG signals were filtered using a band-pass filter with a range of 20\u2013500 Hz. Subjects walked at their own comfortable speed until at least six successful trials were captured (excluding the initial acceleration and deceleration phases of the assessment).2.2.3. Parameters and data analysisAt the end of the test, the synchronization results of the Vicon and DELSYS data were imported into Python software for data processing and analysis. The SEMG parameters included in this study are as follows: (1) Time domain parameters: root mean square peak (RMS-peak) and RMS-peak time (i.e., the onset of the RMS-peak within the gait cycle). The RMS-peak represents the muscle force exerted during exercise; the RMS-peak time reflects the time of muscle activation during the gait cycle. The specific data were processed as follows: RMS values during each gait cycle were calculated using a 30 ms window and a step length of 20 ms. After normalizing the time according to the gait cycle, the average RMS value of the six gait cycles is calculated and the distribution of the RMS values is plotted, and then the RMS-peak and RMS-peak times (as a percentage of the gait cycle) are calculated. (2) Frequency domain parameters: the mean power frequency (MPF) and median frequency (MF) were chosen to reflect mainly the degree of muscle fatigue. The specific data processing methods are as follows. First, the fast Fourier transform of the SEMG signal was performed to calculate the MPF and MF for each gait cycle, and then the average MPF and MF for the six gait cycles were calculated.2.3. Establishment of RF diagnosis model2.3.1. Method of model establishmentTo establish the diagnostic model, we employed the RF algorithm using Python 3.7 scikit learn. To mitigate individual differences, we selected parameters that showed significant differences between the two lower limbs. Specifically, we considered the absolute value of the difference between the parameters of healthy controls and the difference between symptomatic and asymptomatic sides of LDH patients.2.3.2. Process of model establishmentArchitecture of input and output layers: the RF model used in this study comprises eight input parameters and three output layers: no compression, L5 nerve root compression, and S1 nerve root compression. The input parameters consist of the SEMG parameters of TA and LG, namely RMS-peak, RMS-peak time, MPF, and MF.Training parameter settings: (1) Sample size setting: we selected 88 subjects, with 50% of them being allocated to the training set and the remaining 50% to the prediction set. (2) Superparameter setting: we selected n_Estimators, which refers to the number of sub-datasets generated by bootstrapping the original dataset, and set it as 50 in this study. (3) During the training process, all data were used in each round. We set the stopping criteria based on two situations: firstly, when the required accuracy is achieved (RMS error reaches 0.005), the training is stopped. Secondly, when the training process fails to achieve the required accuracy, we stop the training until the maximum number of iterations, which is set to 1,500 times, is reached.2.3.3. Model validationDuring the experiments, the accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1-score, and Kappa values were calculated 10 times using the repeated reservation experiment principle. Additionally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the diagnosis model.2.3.4. Establishment of the final modelIn order to ensure the reliability of the diagnosis results, the testing procedure of the RF diagnosis model was repeated up to 10 times. If the results were not satisfactory, the procedure was repeated starting from the screening of independent variables. However, if the results were deemed satisfactory and reliable, the data from all patients were used to retrain and establish the RF diagnosis model. This approach aimed to ensure that the final diagnosis model had high accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1-score, Kappa values, and efficiency in detecting the different levels of nerve root compression.2.4. Statistical analysisThe data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error or median (interquartile range) based on the distribution characteristics. Normal distribution of data was assessed using the K-S test. Paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for comparison between groups for normally distributed data. For non-normally distributed data, non-parametric rank sum test such as Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison of two related groups, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used for comparison of multiple groups, and pairwise comparison of multiple groups was performed using Bonferroni test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.3. Results3.1. SEMG characteristics of patients with different nerve root compressionIn the healthy group, the SEMG performance of each healthy subject was combined and averaged for their left and right sides, as all healthy subjects walked symmetrically. Their peak RMS, RMS-peak time, MPF, and MF were not significantly different from the asymptomatic side of patients in the L5 and S1 groups (Figure 3).Panels (A\u2013C) are typical SEMG presentations of L5 nerve root compression: on the symptomatic side, delayed activation of TA (A) and decreased peak RMS of LG (B), showing co-contraction of TA and LG (C). Panels (D\u2013F) are typical SEMG presentations of S1 nerve root compression: on the symptomatic side, activation of the LG is shifted forward (D), peak RMS of the TA is decreased (E), and a double peak and co-contraction of the LG and TA is found (F).In L5 group, compared with the asymptomatic side, the RMS-peak time of TA in the symptomatic side was significantly delayed (P < 0.001), the MPF and MF of TA were significantly decreased (both P < 0.001); the RMS-peak of LG was also significantly decreased (P = 0.016) (Table 2). The delayed activation of TA was manifested by a later occurrence in the gait cycle [symptomatic side: 35 (25.5, 61), asymptomatic side 11 (7.5, 15), P < 0.001] and resulted in the co-contraction with LG (Figure 3).Surface electromyography characteristics of patients with L5 nerve root compression during walking.\t\tSymptomatic side\tAsymptomatic side\tP-value\t \t\t\tMedian (interquartile range)/mean \u00b1 SE\tMedian (interquartile range)/mean \u00b1 SE\t\t \tTA\tRMS-peak (\u03bcV)#\t48.89 (19.26, 69.17)\t34.16 (26.15, 100.16)\t0.256\t \t\tRMS-peak time (%)#\t35 (25.5, 61)\t11 (7.5, 15)\t<0.001*\t \t\tMPF (Hz)\t62.74 \u00b1 4.28\t77.55 \u00b1 5.58\t<0.001*\t \t\tMF (Hz)#\t50.33 (38.75, 64.71)\t75.69 (64.57, 94.36)\t<0.001*\t \tLG\tRMS-peak (\u03bcV)#\t24.99 (13.89, 35.38)\t30.12 (25.27, 40.97)\t0.016*\t \t\tRMS-peak time (%)#\t43 (31.5, 45.5)\t43 (39.5, 48)\t0.741\t \t\tMPF (Hz)#\t82.67 (58.36, 98.70)\t96.28 (40.77, 106.21)\t0.614\t \t\tMF (Hz)\t68.19 \u00b1 4.69\t70.67 \u00b1 5.02\t0.122\t \t*P < 0.05.#Data does not follow normal distribution and is expressed as median (interquartile range).In S1 group, compared with the asymptomatic side, as for LG, the RMS-peak in the symptomatic side was significantly decreased (P = 0.003), the RMS-peak time was significantly moved forward (P < 0.001), the MPF and MF were significantly decreased (both P < 0.001), and the RMS-peak of TA in the symptomatic side was also significantly decreased (P = 0.043) (Table 3). The early activation of LG was manifested by an earlier occurrence in the gait cycle [affected side: 27 (14.5, 37.5), the contralateral side: 44 (38.5, 46.5), P < 0.001], showing a trend of bimodal activation and co-contraction with TA (Figure 3).Surface electromyography characteristics of patients with S1 nerve root compression during walking.\t\tSymptomatic side\tAsymptomatic side\tP-value\t \t\t\tMedian (interquartile range)/mean \u00b1 SE\tMedian (interquartile range)/mean \u00b1 SE\t\t \tTA\tRMS-peak (\u03bc V)#\t39.63 (35.49, 66.34)\t62.49 (33.72, 156.43)\t0.003*\t \t\tRMS-peak time (%)#\t6 (4, 8)\t5 (4, 6.5)\t0.082\t \t\tMPF (Hz)#\t66.67 (54.96, 81.12)\t87.03 (62.77, 97.46)\t0.071\t \t\tMF (Hz)#\t54.22 (39.39, 65.42)\t60.67 (44.84, 77.80)\t0.239\t \tLG\tRMS-peak (\u03bc V)\t45.10 \u00b1 4.80\t62.28 \u00b1 7.01\t0.043*\t \t\tRMS-peak time (%)#\t27 (14.5, 37.5)\t44 (38.5, 46.5)\t<0.001*\t \t\tMPF (Hz)\t69.14 \u00b1 4.24\t95.34 \u00b1 3.59\t<0.001*\t \t\tMF (Hz)\t54.15 \u00b1 4.49\t80.39 \u00b1 5.15\t<0.001*\t \t*P < 0.05.#Data does not follow normal distribution and is expressed as median (interquartile range).Compared to the healthy group (Table 4), the L5 group showed significant delays in the RMS-peak time of TA (P < 0.001) and significant decreases in the MF (P = 0.002) and MPF (P = 0.001) of TA and LG. Similarly, the S1 group showed significant differences in the RMS-peak (P = 0.043) and MPF (P < 0.001) of LG and in the MPF (P = 0.033) and MF (P = 0.001) of TA, when compared to the healthy group. Additionally, the RMS-peak time of TA was significantly delayed in the L5 group compared to the S1 group (P < 0.001), while the RMS-peak of LG was significantly decreased (P = 0.001).

Analysis of SEMG characteristics in lower limb musclesLumbar disc herniation patients often experience reduced muscle strength and endurance. Previous studies have demonstrated that compression of the L5 nerve root can result in TA dysfunction, while compression of the S1 nerve root can lead to gastrocnemius dysfunction. Additionally, LDH patients with low back pain tend to experience increased multifidus muscle fatigue. However, it can be challenging to diagnose the cause of abnormal gait when multiple pathological conditions coexist. In one case, peroneal nerve compression caused by ganglion cyst combined with L5 radiculopathy was observed, and electrical diagnosis was found to improve diagnostic accuracy in addition to MRI and other imaging methods. SEMG is an effective tool for accurately assessing neuromuscular function in patients and has been widely used for clinical diagnosis and evaluation of various diseases and dysfunctions. While some studies have used SEMG to observe and record muscle function in LDH patients, most of these studies have focused on SEMG signals from paravertebral muscles and other muscles in the lumbar region, with only a few studies examining changes and dynamic adjustments in lower limb muscles in LDH patients. A study in 2020 found that abnormal gait in LDH patients was associated with abnormal lower limb muscle activity and neurological control disorders.In this study, SEMG analysis was conducted on LDH patients, which revealed significant changes in the muscle activation patterns of patients with L5 and S1 nerve root compression. In cases where the L5 nerve root was compressed, neural control disorders were observed mainly in the TA. Under normal circumstances, the activation of TA muscle occurs prior to the completion of 12% of the gait cycle. However, in L5 group patients, the RMS-peak time of the TA in the symptomatic side was significantly delayed, with a median activation time of 35% of the gait cycle, resulting in a tendency of co-contraction with LG. Additionally, the MPF and MF were significantly decreased, and the RMS-peak of LG in the symptomatic side was also decreased. In cases where the S1 nerve root was compressed, neural control disorders were observed mainly in the LG. Normally, the activation peak of LG appears in the late stance phase of the gait cycle, but in S1 group patients, the activation time of LG was advanced, with the median activation time shifting from 44 to 27% in the symptomatic side, resulting in a bimodal activation pattern and a tendency of co-contraction with TA. The RMS-peak, MPF, and MF of LG decreased, and the RMS-peak of TA also decreased accordingly. Compared with the healthy group, LDH patients showed similar changes in muscle activation patterns on the symptomatic side. Moreover, compared with the S1 group and healthy group, the activation time of TA in the L5 group was significantly delayed, and the degree of fatigue in the TA was increased. The RMS-peak in LG was also significantly lower than in the S1 group. The RMS-peak time of LG in the S1 group was significantly advanced compared to that in the L5 group, and the MPF and MF of TA, and the RMS-peak and MPF of LG were significantly lower than in the healthy group.The results of this study demonstrate that the functional state of the main muscles innervated by the corresponding nerve root changed when patients with different nerve root compressions were walking, which was related to neuromuscular control disorders after nerve compression. This led to abnormal recruitment and fatigue of the corresponding muscle at a specific stage of the gait cycle. In the case of L5 nerve root compression, mechanical compression of the nerve can trigger conduction function abnormalities, resulting in a significant delay in the peak activation of the symptomatic TA and a significant increase in the overlap contraction area with LG. At this point, the LG and TA, a pair of antagonist muscles, exhibit a co-contraction phenomenon, which is an ineffective muscle coordination strategy that is different from normal alternating contraction. This finding is consistent with the findings of, who also observed inappropriate co-contraction between the TA and gastrocnemius during walking in LDH patients.Taking into account that LG is mainly innervated by the S1 nerve root, the compression of the L5 nerve root has a relatively small effect on LG. Therefore, to avoid dysfunction caused by muscle co-contraction, the RMS-peak of LG on the symptomatic side decreased accordingly. Co-contraction of antagonist muscles can cause joint stiffness or postural abnormalities, significantly increasing energy expenditure during exercise and making muscles more prone to fatigue. This is consistent with the decrease in MPF and MF of the symptomatic TA. It may also partially explain why LDH patients often experience symptoms such as joint stiffness, claudication, muscle pain, and discomfort during walking.When the S1 nerve root is compressed, the RMS distribution of LG changes to a bimodal activation pattern in the gait cycle, with the first peak occurring in the mid-stance stage. This early contraction of LG is thought to be a compensatory mechanism that helps speed up the transfer of the center of gravity, reduce weight-bearing on the symptomatic side, facilitate knee flexion, and reduce the length of the lower limb to avoid pain during single leg support. Our previous study also found similar SEMG changes in patients with S1 nerve root compression. Due to the compensatory contraction being small, the RMS-peak of LG was significantly lower on the symptomatic side than the asymptomatic side, and the earlier activation also led to an increase in the overlap contraction area with TA, which resulted in the same co-contraction of the antagonist muscles seen in L5 nerve root compression. Additionally, the RMS-peak of TA also decreased accordingly.However, we also recognize that different diagnoses of L5 and S1 nerve root compression may lead to different treatment options. For example, L5 nerve root compression may result in altered activity patterns in the TA and may require physiotherapy targeting the TA to improve its function and reduce co-contraction with the LG. Conversely, when the S1 nerve root is compressed, the activity pattern of the LG is altered and physiotherapy targeting the LG may be required to improve its function. In forthcoming research endeavors, our aspiration is not only to delve deeper into this salient issue to assist clinicians in diagnosing the location of nerve root compression more accurately but also to evaluate pre- and post-operative EMG patterns. In particular, we are interested in scrutinizing cases that result in substantial nerve decompression and meaningful pain improvement post-surgery. Such assessments could serve as pivotal indicators of normalized EMG activation, as per our hypothesis, ultimately enhancing the scope and efficacy of treatment options for patients.4.2. RF diagnosis model based on SEMG parametersRandom forest is a highly flexible and innovative machine learning algorithm that has a broad range of potential applications. It was proposed by American scholar Breiman in 2001, building on the classification tree algorithm developed in the 1980s. Compared to other current algorithms, RF offers exceptional accuracy, can effectively handle large datasets, and is adept at processing input samples with high-dimensional features while evaluating the importance of each feature in classification problems. applied the RF algorithm to evaluate the gait of elderly individuals, demonstrating that RF improved gait classification accuracy. found that the RF algorithm can provide a solution for fusing human and exoskeleton equipment by giving corresponding weight to the original data, enhancing the real-time classification of traditional SEMG signals.In this study, we trained an RF classification model using SEMG parameters. The training process involved ten repeated cross-validation experiments, where the model was trained on 50% of the patients and validated on the remaining 50% each time. The results showed that the RF model had a high diagnostic accuracy and could assist in localizing compressed nerve roots in LDH patients. We used the area under the ROC curve as the performance metric to evaluate the model\u2019s performance. The ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity (true positive rate) against 1-specificity (false positive rate) for different threshold values. A larger area under the curve indicates higher diagnostic accuracy. Based on our results, the RF model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.93, which indicates that it is an effective diagnostic model.In addition, RF algorithm can give corresponding weights to the original data, score the classification ability of different parameters, and identify the parameters that play an important role in the classification. Based on the characteristics of RF, we also compared the parameter weights of this model, and found that the RMS-peak time of TA has the highest weight ratio (26%). It is suggested that RMS-peak time of TA can be used as the most important SEMG parameter to identify L5 or S1 compressed nerve roots, which can provide further reference for optimizing the diagnosis model in the future.Our study is a replication of the observational study by and we are in a larger, new cohort of patients where we confirm previous findings and also further expand the knowledge in this area. Our findings suggest that the RF model can assist in the localization and diagnosis of compressed nerve roots in LDH patients, while the SEMG parameters can provide a further reference for optimizing the diagnostic model.However, while SEMG is a powerful tool to help us understand the mechanisms of disease, the feasibility of implementing such a diagnostic procedure in a clinical setting also needs to be considered. While SEMG equipment is relatively easy to obtain and use, motion capture systems may require more equipment and space. In addition, some training and equipment maintenance may be required in order to integrate such a diagnostic procedure with existing diagnostic processes.Despite these challenges, we believe that as technology advances and costs decrease, the use of SEMG and motion capture systems in clinical settings will become increasingly feasible. We look forward to future research that will further explore the implementation of such diagnostic procedures to help clinicians more accurately diagnose the location of nerve root compression and provide better treatment options for patients.5. ConclusionThis study highlights the potential of SEMG as a diagnostic tool for LDH patients with L5 and S1 nerve root compression. The differences in SEMG characteristics between TA and LG during walking provide valuable insights into the location of nerve root compression. The RF algorithm-based diagnostic model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall, indicating its potential as a reliable diagnostic tool. The model\u2019s ability to identify the weights of different SEMG parameters provides clinicians with a better understanding of the relative importance of each parameter in diagnosis.Overall, this study suggests that SEMG can serve as an effective complementary diagnostic tool for LDH, helping clinicians accurately diagnose the location of nerve root compression and provide better treatment options for patients.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view. The error bar corresponds to the standard error of the mean for all fields of view and replicates per condition. Differences between groups were identified using Student\u2019s t-test, and their significance is displayed with either one or two asterisks.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: .Author ContributionsB.P. conceived the study and managed funding for the project; B.P., K.J. and Q.C. wrote the manuscript and designed experiments; Experiments were performed by K.J., Q.C. and B.P.; Data analysis was performed by K.J., G.W. and B.P.; S.F. provided consulting services and contributed to the editing of the manuscript.

        "content": "When lactate accumulation in a tumor microenvironment reaches an average concentration of 10-20 mM, it tends to reflect a high degree of malignancy. However, the hypothesis that tumor-derived lactate has a number of partially adverse biological effects on malignant and tumor-associated host cells requires further evidence. The present study attempted to evaluate the impact of lactate on the process of angiogenesis, in particular on the formation of tubular structures. The endothelial cell (EC) network in desmoplastic breast tumors is primarily located in areas of reactive fibroblastic stroma. We employed a fibroblast-endothelial cell co-culture model as in vitro angiogenesis system normally producing florid in vitro tubule formation to analyze this situation. In contrast to previous studies, we found that lactate significantly reduces EC network formation in a dose-dependent manner as quantified by semi-automated morphometric analyses following immunohistochemical staining. The decrease in CD31-positive tubular structures and the number of intersections was independent of VEGF supplementation and became more pronounced in the presence of protons. The number of cells, primarily of the fibroblast population, was reduced but cell loss could not be attributed to a decrease in proliferative activity or pronounced apoptotic cell death. Treatment with 10 mM lactate was accompanied by enhanced mRNA expression and release of TGF-beta1, which also shows anti-angiogenic activity in the model. Both TGF-beta1 and lactate induced myofibroblastic differentiation adjacent to the EC tubular structures. The lactate response on the EC network was diminished by TGF-beta1 neutralization, indicating a causal relationship between lactate and TGF-beta1 in the finely tuned processes of vessel formation and maturation which may also occur in vivo within tumor tissue.",

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs.

Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

        "content": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subgroup of breast carcinoma, still lacking specific markers for an effective targeted therapy and with a poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. In this study we investigated the possibility that TNBC cells contribute to the establishment of tumor vascular network by the process known as vasculogenic mimicry, through endothelial cell differentiation. Vascular-like functional properties of breast cancer cell lines were investigated in vitro by tube formation assay and in vivo by confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry on frozen tumor sections. TNBCs express endothelial markers and acquire the ability to form vascular-like channels in vitro and in vivo, both in xenograft models and in human specimens, generating blood lacunae surrounded by tumor cells. Notably this feature is significantly associated with reduced disease free survival. The impairment of the main pathways involved in vessel formation, by treatment with inhibitors (i.e. Sunitinib and Bevacizumab) or by siRNA-mediating silencing, allowed the identification of PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2 as relevant players in this phenomenon. Inhibition of these tyrosine kinase receptors negatively affects vascular lacunae formation and significantly inhibits TNBC growth in vivo. In summary, we demonstrated that TNBCs have the ability to form vascular-like channels in vitro and to generate blood lacunae lined by tumor cells in vivo. Moreover, this feature is associated with poor outcome, probably contributing to the aggressiveness of this breast cancer subgroup. Finally, PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2-mediated pathways, identified as relevant in mediating this characteristic, potentially represent valid targets for a specific therapy of this breast cancer subgroup.",

The aim of this study is to compare the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy and pick up candidate genes that might associate with chemotherapy resistance and could be used as predictors of treatment response. CAFs were cultured from surgically resected primary breast cancers and identified with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Flow cytometry (FCM).

Cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT) were performed to compare the function of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, after chemotherapy. Totally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with Taxotere (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). According to our study, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited characteristic phenotype. After chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. Moreover, 35 differentially expressed genes (absolute fold change &gt;2) were identified between CAFs after chemotherapy and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 were picked up as the candidate markers, of which the differential expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed.

Cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT) were performed to compare the function of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, after chemotherapy. Totally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with Taxotere (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). According to our study, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited characteristic phenotype. After chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. Moreover, 35 differentially expressed genes (absolute fold change >2) were identified between CAFs after chemotherapy and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 were picked up as the candidate markers, of which the differential expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed. The results indicate the changes of gene expression in CAFs induced by Taxotere treatment and propose the candidate markers that possibly associate with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer.IntroductionBreast cancer is considered as the most common cancer in women, accounting for 29% of estimated new cancer cases and 14% of estimated cancer-related deaths. Chemotherapy is one of the cornerstone treatments in patients with breast cancer, which overall improves breast cancer outcome by 5\u201310% in patients with node negative disease. However, its use is increasingly affected by chemotherapy resistance and lack of effective predictors. Recently, emerging evidences have suggested that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could contribute to chemotherapy resistances in breast cancer treatment. As the most frequent component of stroma cells in tumor microenvironment, CAFs have been assumed to play an important role in the carcinogenesis and development of breast cancer. Moreover, Farmer et al. reported that increased stromal gene expression predicts resistance to preoperative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (FEC), suggesting that stroma activation could be involved in chemotherapy resistance. Additionally, it was shown that CAFs mediated resistance to chemotherapy by releasing collagen I. Loeffler et al. have developed a vaccine that could target CAFs and allow reversing resistance to chemotherapy.Considering the interaction between CAFs and chemotherapy resistance, it would be reasonable that chemotherapy-induced damage could have an impact on CAFs and change the expression of some relevant factors, which could participate in chemotherapy resistance. In our study, we have cultured CAFs which were derived from surgically resected primary breast cancers and compared the gene expression profiling of CAFs before and after chemotherapy. The goal will be to find candidate markers from tumor microenvironment that associate with breast cancer chemotherapy resistance and discuss the possibility that these markers could be used as predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and feasible for targeted therapy.Materials and Methods1. Ethics StatementThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Human Ethics Committee of Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Written informed consent for using the samples for research purposes was obtained from all patients prior to surgery.2. Cell Culture of CAFs and Breast Cancer Cell LineTissues for primary cultures of CAFs were collected from 10 breast cancer patients who underwent complete surgical resection of their tumors at Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University. Only tissues in excess of those required for clinical diagnoses were harvested for this study. Harvested tissues were placed in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen Corporation) for immediate transportation on ice to the laboratory. Tissues were minced into small pieces, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and digested for 20 h at 37\u00b0C in prepared reagent containing collagenase type I and Hyaluronidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell suspension was filtrated with 100 mesh screen and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and then the pellet was resuspended in the fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cell counting was performed with the Beckman Coulter Cell and Particle Counter Z1. The population doubling was estimated based on the increase in cell number counted at each passage time. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the breast cancer cell line, according to the normal procedure (Sigma-Aldrich).3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)Primary antibodies for immunostaining included multi-cytokeratin (CK), Vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), CD34, and TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) (Labvision). CAFs were seeded in chamber slides and fixed in cold acetone. After antigen retrieval and blocking of endogenous peroxidase in 3% hydrogen peroxide, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature in a moist chamber for 60 min. Specific signals were visualized by incubation with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody for 60 min, followed by incubation with 3,3/-diaminobenzidine (DAB) used as a chromogen to create brown staining. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 5 min, and the slides were coverslipped.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM)CAFs were collected and prepared as a single cell suspension by mechanical blowing with PBS at the concentration of 1\u00d7105/ml. The expression of CD34 and CD45 (MACS) was detected using FCM (FACSC alibar; BD).5. Cell Adhesion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber (Transwell; Corning). For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere (Sanofi). Afterwards, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, until confluent. Matrigel (BD) was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and then 100 \u00b5l matrigel was added to each well in new 24-well plates. Two groups of MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested and transferred to 24-well plates coated with matrigel. After incubation for 1 h, MDA-MB-231 cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of MDA-MB-231 cells that adhered to the bottom of coated wells was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.6. Invasion AssayThe harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. Matrigel was equilibrated with serum-free DMEM by proportion of 1\u22363 before coating, and 50 \u00b5l/cm2 matrigel was added to each filter. The filters were placed in 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each upper chamber, and CAFs were added to the lower chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were then treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed with a cotton swab, and the filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with 5% crystal violet. The number of cells that migrated to the lower side of the filter was counted and the morphology was recorded with an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70). The assay was done twice, each in triplicate.7. Proliferation Assay (MTT)The harvested MDA-MB-231 cells were diluted with DMEM at the concentration of 40000/ml, while CAFs were diluted at the concentration of 20000/ml. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to 24-well plates, which were divided into two groups. For one group based on co-culture assay, the filters were placed in 24 well plates and CAFs were added to each upper chamber. For the other group, the filters and CAFs were not used. Both groups were treated with 0 ng/ml, 4 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml Taxotere, respectively. Then the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 h. Assays were initiated by adding 100 \u00b5l MTT (2 mg/ml) to each well and incubating the cells for an additional 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Afterwards, the medium was removed and 1 ml dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. Finally, the supernatants were transferred to 96-well plates in triplicate, which were read at a wavelength of 550 nm with a Thermo Scientific Multiskan\u00ae Spectrum.8. mRNA Expression ProfilingTotally 6 pairs of CAFs were prepared for microarray analysis. Each pair of CAFs were obtained from the same patient and classified into two groups. One group was treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h (regarded as after chemotherapy) while the other group was not processed with Taxotere (regarded as before chemotherapy). Total RNA was extracted from all cultured CAFs using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Microarray studies were performed by Capital Medical University Microarray Centre, using Illumina humanHT-12 v4 expression BeadChip based on Illumina BeadStation500. The biotinylated cRNA preparation, hybridization, and scanning of microarrays were done according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Biological replicates have been used to reduce errors. Illumina Gene Expression Beaderchips have internal control features to monitor data quality. The GenomeStudio software (Ilumina) calculates and reports a detection p-value, which determines whether a transcript on the array is called detected. In our study, a detection p-value below the threshold of 0.01 indicated that a gene could be considered as expressed. Differentially expressed genes in CAFs before chemotherapy vs. after chemotherapy were also identified and analyzed with GenomeStudio. The output was filtered to include genes whose expression was altered at least two-fold. The dataset of the microarray analysis has been deposited in ArrayExpress, with the accession number E-MTAB-1614.9. Real-Time PCRReal-Time PCR was performed to confirm differential gene expression in cultured CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere for 24 h), using BIO-RAD IQ5 Real-Time PCR System. cDNA was synthesized using 1 \u00b5g total RNA, oligo (dT), and Superscript\u2122 III Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesis was done according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All the primers were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) for thecandidate genes. Predicted PCR product sequences were verified by using BLAST for recognition of target and non-target sequences.10. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc). Student\u2019s t test was used to test for statistical significance. Data were presented as the mean\u00b1standard error. p<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.Results1. Characterization of Primary-cultured CAFsBy using a study protocol approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Board, CAFs were cultured from 10 surgically resected primary breast cancers which were histologically confirmed. The cultured cells were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. The morphological and immunohistochemical pictures of CAFs were represented in Figure 1A. Additionally, FCM showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs (Figure 1B).Characterization of primary-cultured CAFs.A showed the cultured cells which were morphologically characterized with flat spindle shape, rich cytoplasm and flat ovoid nuclear. With immunostaining, the primary-cultured CAFs exhibited positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, and TE-7, but negative expression of CK and CD34. B showed negative expression of CD34 and CD45 in CAFs with FCM.2. CAFs Promotes the Function of Breast Cancer Cells after ChemotherapyWe assumed that chemotherapy-induced damage interacted with tumor microenvironment and hence compared the function of MDA-MB-231 cells after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere) co-cultured with CAFs and that without CAFs. By using cell adhesion assay, invasion assay, and proliferation assay (MTT), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with MDA-MB-231 cells without CAFs. The representative pictures of cell functional studies were shown in Figure 2.The function comparison of MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs and MDA-MB-231 cells without co-culture, when treated with Taxotere.By using cell adhesion assay (A), invasion assay (B), and MTT assay (C), it was observed that after chemotherapy, MDA-MB-231 cells co-cultured with CAFs displayed increasing adhesion, invasiveness and proliferation abilities, compared with cells without co-culture.3. Comparison of Gene Expression Profiling in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyTotally 24314 expressed genes were detected in the microarray assay and 35 differentially expressed genes were identified (absolute fold change >2) between CAFs after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) and before chemotherapy, including 17 up-regulated genes and 18 down-regulated genes. The differentially expressed genes were summarized in Table S1 and Figure 3A with clustering analysis. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity (Figure 3B). The differentially expressed genes were also annotated in several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion (hsa04510), Regulation of actin cytoskeleton (hsa04810), and MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010).Hierarchical clustering of gene analysis expression and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with Taxotere).A showed the Heatmap plot of scaled gene-expression levels. The first 6 columns marked with \u201c1\u201d on top have represented the samples untreated with Taxotere, while the following 6 columns marked with \u201c2\u201d have represented the samples treated with Taxotere. Rows are genes with mean fold change between CAFs before and after chemotherapy. B and C revealed that these genes including up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes were mainly involved in nucleotide binding, actin binding, cytoskeletal protein binding and structural molecule activity through GO analysis.4. Differential Expression of Candidate Genes in CAFs before and after ChemotherapyWe have picked up 6 genes from 35 differential genes and confirmed the different gene expression in CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) via Real-Time PCR, using triplicate samples. The candidate genes included up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05). The pictures were represented in Figure 4.Differential expression of candidate genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy.The candidate genes were picked up from 35 differential genes, including up-regulated genes CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, as well as down-regulated genes RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7. The differential expression of 6 genes in three pairs of CAFs before and after chemotherapy (treated with 20 ng/ml Taxotere) was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. It was found that there was significant difference between the expression of 6 candidate genes in CAFs before chemotherapy and after chemotherapy (p<0.05).DiscussionAs is known, cancer is a systemic disease encompassing multiple components of both tumor cells themselves and tumor microenvironment. The notion is now widely accepted that the development and progression of cancer highly depends on the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment. Recently, many investigations have pointed to stromal cells as the major regulator in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast cancers. However, the origin of CAFs has been a debate. Based on different theories, CAFs might arise from activated resident fibroblasts, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, cancer cells that undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), or other undetermined mechanisms. Correspondingly, CAFs were reported to exhibit different expression of multiple biomarkers such \u03b1-SMA, FSP-1, FAP, platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b1 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b1), platelet-derived growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (PDGFR-\u03b2), vimentin, CAV-1, PTEN, p21, or TP53 mutation. According to our study, CAFs showed positive expression of \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, TE-7 (anti-fibroblast antibody) and negative expression of CK, CD34, as well as CD45, suggesting that these primary-cultured CAFs were more likely to arise from activated resident fibroblasts, rather than epithelial cells, endothelial cells or bone marrow. We are aware that the observation based on morphological characteristics is just weak evidence for explaining the origin hypothesis, which needs further and more fundamental studies. Moreover, our data showed that CAFs could promote the adhesion, invasion and proliferation of breast cancer cells, which was consistent with peer researches.Breast cancer is known as the leading cause of death in women worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been considered as an effective way which could improve the outcomes especially in patients with advanced and inflammatory diseases. However, the resistance of tumor cells to a broad range of chemotherapeutic drugs and lack of useful predictive markers of response to NAC continue to be problems. Though the precise nature and molecular mechanism of chemotherapy resistance is still unclear, many current studies have focused on identifying novel predictors of chemotherapy efficiency. CAFs merit attention, in consideration of frequent association with chemotherapy resistance. Sonnenberg et al. reported highly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in CAFs from lung and breast, which could explain some levels of resistance in stroma-positive tumors where stroma would not be sensitive to chemotherapy. Furthermore, an oral DNA vaccine targeting fibroblasts activation protein (FAP) was developed to suppress primary tumor cell growth and metastasis of multidrug-resistant murine breast carcinoma and allowed reversing resistance to chemotherapy, by increasing intratumoral drug uptake. Based on our data, the comparison of gene expression profiling between CAFs before and after chemotherapy indicated the solid gene changes and provided candidate markers that might participate in chemotherapy resistance. Considering the correlation of breast cancer treatment and tumor microenvironment (especially CAFs), we suppose that the genes about membrane protein and secreted factors will be likely to associate with chemotherapy resistance. Then we have looked through the relevant literatures, to evaluate the research status and prospect of these genes, and eventually chosen CXCL2, MMP1, IL8, RARRES1, FGF1, and CXCR7 as candidate genes. The differential expression of these genes in CAFs before and after chemotherapy was confirmed by RT-RCR (p<0.05), suggesting potential predictors of response to treatment.CXCL2 is one member of a family of structurally related chemokines, which are also called ELR-positive subgroup of CXC-chemokines. It was reported that CXCL2 could enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro and differential expression of CXCL2 in colon cancer had impact on metastatic disease and survival. In addition, CXCL2 was found to show significantly different expression in 5-FU responder and nonresponder breast cancer cell lines, suggesting its relationship with chemotherapy response. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1 has been focused on, in view of the association between its five polymorphisms and lung cancer risk. Moreover, the study carried out by Li et al. established the relationship between TP and MMPs in cancer cell invasion. Recently, the up-regulation expression of MMP1 was observed during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude mice, indicating potential targets involved in the control of metastasis. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which was indicated to correlate with the growth and progression of tumors. Some interesting observations were made with regard to the prognostic role of baseline plasma IL8 protein levels in breast cancer patients treated with weekly docetaxel. Besides, Snoussi et al. pointed out that the polymorphisms in IL-8 and its receptor CXCR2 are associated with increased breast cancer risk and disease progress, implying that IL-8 and CXCR2 might contribute to breast cancer pathogenesis and aggressiveness. Lee et al. found that increased expression of IL-8 in the tumor microenvironment enhanced colon cancer growth and metastasis, which is very inspiring for our research. All the above markers including CXCL2, MMP1 and IL-8 were up-regulated based on our study, while FGF1, RARRES1 and CXCR7 as follows were down-regulated.As is known, breast cancer cells overexpress fibroblast growth factor receptors. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was reported to be especially suitable as chemotherapeutic drug carrier in light of its biological activity. Additionally, FGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR could efficiently decrease breast cancer cell viability, suggesting the possibility for targeted therapy. According to these data, it could be assumed that decreased expression of FGF1 might be involved in the chemotherapy resistance. Retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) is a retinoid regulated gene, which is accounted as a tumor suppress gene and lost in many cancer cells. It has been demonstrated that the down-regulation of RARRES1 is related to tumor growth of colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The investigation on the role of RARRES1 in the chemotherapy resistance is still rare, therefore its decreased expression in CAFs after chemotherapy caused our attention. CXCR7, as well as CXCR4, have been known as the receptors of chemokine CXCL12. Liberman et al. considered that CXCR7 would elicit anti-tumorigenic functions, and may act as a regulator of CXCR4/CXCL12-mediated signaling in neuroblastoma. Recently Hernandez et al. found that CXCR7 impaired invasion of breast cancer, in contrast to CXCR4. We propose that CXCR7 would contribute to the chemotherapy resistance in the condition of treatment-induced damage to the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, in the abovementioned candidate genes, CXCL2, MMP1 and IL8 are recognized as secretory-type genes, which possibly could be tested in serum in the form of genes or proteins. Its relationship with prognosis will be studied.Overall, in this study we have primarily cultured CAFs, compared its gene expression profiling before and after chemotherapy, and picked up 6 candidate genes which are possibly associated with chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer. We hope that our study might supply the potential predictors for chemotherapy efficiency and possible targets for treatment, which could provide the patient with optimal therapeutic management and better prognosis. For further study, the molecular mechanism of these candidate markers will continue to be researched to elucidate their relationship with chemotherapy resistance.Supporting InformationReferencesCancer statistics, 2012Effects of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy for early breast cancer on recurrence and 15-year survival: an overview of the randomised trialsImplication of tumor microenvironment in the resistance to chemotherapy in breast cancer patientsStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionRoots and stems: stem cells in cancerA stroma-related gene signature predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancerRole of extracellular matrix assembly in interstitial transport in solid tumorsTargeting tumor-associated fibroblasts improves cancer chemotherapy by increasing intratumoral drug uptakeTumor microenvironment and breast cancer progression: A complex scenarioFibroblasts in cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor growth-bystanders turning into key playersA fibroblast-associated antigen: characterization in fibroblasts and immunoreactivity in smooth muscle differentiated stromal cellsEpithelial to mesenchymal transition in human breast cancer can provide a nonmalignant stromaBone marrow contribution to tumor-associated myofibroblasts and fibroblastsAdipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factorsp53 Attenuates cancer cell migration and invasion through repression of SDF-1/CXCL12 expression in stromal fibroblastsExpression of p21waf1/Cip1 in stromal fibroblasts of primary breast tumorsPten in stromal fibroblasts suppresses mammary epithelial tumoursCaveolin-1 and mitochondrial SOD2 (MnSOD) function as tumor suppressors in the stromal microenvironment: a new genetically tractable model for human cancer associated fibroblastsRole of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer development and prognosisImpact, mechanisms, and novel chemotherapy strategies for overcoming resistance to anthracyclines and taxanes in metastatic breast cancerAdvances in neoadjuvant (primary) systemic therapy with cytotoxic agentsResearch issues affecting preoperative systemic therapy for operable breast cancer17p12 deletion in breast cancer predicts resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapyBRCA1 protein levels and PIK3CA mutations as predictive biomarkers for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced breast cancer: An exploratory analysisHighly variable response to cytotoxic chemotherapy in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from lung and breastThe role of CXC chemokines and their receptors in cancerDifferential expression of the chemokines GRO-2, GRO-3, and interleukin-8 in colon cancer and their impact on metastatic disease and survivalCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCCL2 and CXCL2 enhance survival of primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitroCurrent evidence on the relationship between five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) gene and lung cancer risk: A meta-analysisIncreased Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases Mediates Thromboxane A2-Induced Invasion in Lung Cancer CellsProtein expression changes during human triple negative breast cancer cell line progression to lymph node metastasis in a xenografted model in nude miceIncreased expression of MMP-9 and IL-8 are correlated with poor prognosis of Bladder CancerInterleukin-8 secretion by ovarian cancer cells increases anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, angiogenic potential, adhesion and invasionExpression of Angiogenic Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer Treated with Weekly DocetaxelCombined effects of IL-8 and CXCR2 gene polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility and aggressivenessInterleukin-8 and its receptor CXCR2 in the tumour microenvironment promote colon cancer growth, progression and metastasisFGF-1 as a possible carrier for targeted drug deliveryFGF1-gold nanoparticle conjugates targeting FGFR efficiently decrease cell viability upon NIR irradiationTazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) expression in prostate carcinomas and its relationship to tumorigenicityRole of the RARRES1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinomaRARRES1 expression is significantly related to tumour differentiation and staging in colorectal adenocarcinomaInvolvement of the CXCR7/CXCR4/CXCL12 Axis in the Malignant Progression of Human NeuroblastomaOpposing roles of CXCR4 and CXCR7 in breast cancer metastasis"

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

Scale\u202f=\u202f100\u202f\u03bcm.Fig. 4Primary 4T1 tumors exhibit typical stromal progression with inner necrotic region development. At present, 4T1 tumor tissue is divided into three regions: proliferative region, transition border, and necrotic core. According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

Representative images of MKi67 (C), \u03b1-SMA (D), TGF-\u03b21 (E) and cytokeratin18 (F) in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 7The patients with TNBC had two kinds of \u03b1-SMA expression: high and low (Fig. 6A). Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

        "content": "The importance of epithelial-stroma interaction in normal breast development and tumor progression has been recognized. To identify genes that were regulated by these reciprocal interactions, we cocultured a nonmalignant (MCF10A) and a breast cancer derived (MDA-MB231) basal cell lines, with fibroblasts isolated from breast benign-disease adjacent tissues (NAF) or with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF), in a transwell system. Gene expression profiles of each coculture pair were compared with the correspondent monocultures, using a customized microarray. Contrariwise to large alterations in epithelial cells genomic profiles, fibroblasts were less affected. In MDA-MB231 highly represented genes downregulated by CAF derived factors coded for proteins important for the specificity of vectorial transport between ER and golgi, possibly affecting cell polarity whereas the response of MCF10A comprised an induction of genes coding for stress responsive proteins, representing a prosurvival effect. While NAF downregulated genes encoding proteins associated to glycolipid and fatty acid biosynthesis in MDA-MB231, potentially affecting membrane biogenesis, in MCF10A, genes critical for growth control and adhesion were altered. NAFs responded to coculture with MDA-MB231 by a decrease in the expression of genes induced by TGFbeta1 and associated to motility. However, there was little change in NAFs gene expression profile influenced by MCF10A. CAFs responded to the presence of both epithelial cells inducing genes implicated in cell proliferation. Our data indicate that interactions between breast fibroblasts and basal epithelial cells resulted in alterations in the genomic profiles of both cell types which may help to clarify some aspects of this heterotypic signaling.",

CAFs provide oncogenic signals to facilitate tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Here, we set out to determine the factors that mediate the conversion of NFs into CAFs, focusing on miRNAs and secreted factors. Down-regulation of miR-1 and miR-206 and upregulation of miR-31 were found in CAFs derived from human lung cancer compared to paired NFs. Dysregulation of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 expression promotes the conversion of NFs into CAFs through regulating VEGFA, CCL2 and FOXO3a expression. In addition, down-regulation of miR-1 and miR-206 and up-regulation of miR-31 has been observed in lung cancer patient plasma. More importantly, we demonstrated that systemic delivery of anti-VEGFA/CCL2 or pre-miR-1, pre-miR-206 and anti-miR-31 dramatically decreased tumor angiogenesis, TAMs accumulation, tumor growth and lung metastasis. In conclusion, our data showed that miRNAs-mediated FOXO3a/VEGF/CCL2 signaling plays a prominent role in transforming NFs into CAFs, thus providing further support for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer.IntroductionFibroblasts, a key cellular component of human tissues and tumors, can be divided into resting and activated fibroblasts. For example, fibroblasts are highly activated at the site of healing wound. The activated fibroblasts invade lesions and generate extracellular matrix (ECM) to serve as a scaffold for other cells. Once a wound is repaired, the activated fibroblasts revert to a resting phenotype, which are mainly known as normal fibroblasts (NFs). It is widely accepted that the development of tumors is not just determined by malignant cancer cells, but also by the activated tumor fibroblasts or carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The CAFs stimulate cancer cell proliferation and progression through the secretion of a variety of cytokines, chemokines and ECM. Growth factors, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), are believed to play crucial roles in fibroblasts activation. However, the molecular mechanisms of the conversion of NFs into CAFs are poorly understood.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding RNAs with an important regulatory role in various physiological and pathological processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs play a regulatory role not only in cancer cells during carcinogenesis but also in the transition or activation of fibroblasts. For example, deregulation of miR-31, miR-214 and miR-155 reprogrammed NFs into CAFs in ovarian cancer. Down-regulation of miR-148a in endometrial cancer CAFs stimulates the motility of endometrial cancer cells. Up-regulation of miR-106b in CAFs promotes gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. MiR-21, a well-known oncomiRNA, was found significantly up-regulated in colorectal CAFs and the latter contributed to colorectal cancer growth and invasion. However, how miRNAs are involved in the conversion of quiescent resident fibroblasts to CAFs in lung cancer remains largely obscure.In our current study, we demonstrated that i) deregulation of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 contributes to the conversion of NFs to CAFs in lung cancer; ii) combination of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 reprograms NFs to CAFs through mediating FOXO3a/VEGFA/CCL2 signaling; and iii) modifying tumor microenvironment via targeting three miRNAs or CCL2/VEGFA significantly reduced tumor angiogenesis, TAMs accumulation, tumor growth and lung metastasis. Our results have clinical implications by providing novel biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis and may possess therapeutic application for lung cancer treatment in the future.ResultsDeregulation of miRNAs in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblastsTo compare the miRNAs expression profile in primary human CAFs and NFs, we performed a miRNA assay to profile the global expression of mature miRNAs in 3 pairs of CAFs isolated from lung carcinoma and matched healthy NFs extracted from a normal area of tissue, at least 10 cm from the tumor area. Both CAFs and NFs were fibronectin and vimentin positive cell populations. The expression levels of alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were significantly higher in CAFs compared to NFs (S1 Fig). We found that miR-1, miR-206, and miR-31 were among the most significantly down- and up- regulated miRNAs in CAFs compared with those in NFs, respectively (Fig 1A). The down-regulation of miR-1 and miR-206 and up-regulation of miR-31 were further confirmed in 15 paired CAFs and NFs from different lung cancer patients by Taqman qRT-PCR (S2 Fig). More interestingly, consistent with our observations in cancer tissues, we found that circulating miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 were also dramatically down- and up- regulated in lung cancer plasma compared with healthy plasma (Fig 1B). In the next step, we compared the expression of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in NFs, which were isolated from the patient sample ID 1, co-cultured with or without RFP-expressing A549 or H460 cells. After 10 days of coculture, NFs were isolated by a flow cytometry sorter within negative RFP signaling cell population. The miR-1, miR-206 down-regulation and miR-31 up-regulation were observed in co-cultured NFs compared to mono-cultured NFs (Fig 1C). Similar alternative pattern of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 can also be observed in NFs from the patient sample ID 7, 11, 15 in co-culture (S3 Fig). Furthermore, we discovered that the lung cancer cells (LCCs)-reprogrammed NFs exhibited stronger ability to promote lung cancer cell migration and colony formation (Fig 1D and 1E), suggesting that cancer cells impart CAF-like properties to NFs during co-culture.Identification of deregulated miRNAs in CAFs compared with NFs.(A) Heat map showing levels of top 20 significantly deregulated miRNAs in three pairs of CAFs and matched healthy NFs. Red, up-regulated; blue, down-regulated. The two most down-regulated miRNAs and one most up-regulated miRNA are highlighted. (B) Plasma levels of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in 21 lung cancer patients and 21 healthy subjects were determined by Taqman qRT-PCR assay. Experiments were performed in triplicate and each repeated three times. (C) RFP-expressing LCCs were co-cultured with NFs for 10 days. Co-cultured NFs were flow-sorted. Levels of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in NFs, co-cultured NFs (with A549 or H460), and CAFs cells were determined by Taqman qRT-PCR assay, and normalized to the U6 levels. (D) LCCs were seeded on the top of a Boyden chamber. The numbers of cells that migrated through the uncoated filter in response to conditional medium (CM) from co-cultured cells (A549/H460+NFs, A549/H460+co-cultured NFs, or A549/H460+CAFs) in the interior sides of the chamber were counted and normalized to LCCs alone. The mean number of cells per field was determined from three fields in three replicated wells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001 vs NFs+LCCs coculture. (E) LCCs were mixed with agarose and seeded into 6-well plates. The CM mediums were added to the wells and be replaced by every two days. After 12 days of culture, colonies were fixed with 100% methanol for 15 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies with diameter more than 1.5 mm were counted. The experiments were performed with three replicates, and repeated for 3 times. **p < 0.001 vs NFs+LCCs coculture.MiRNA-reprogrammed NFs promote LCCs migration, colony formation, tumor growth and TAMs recruitmentTo study the function roles of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in NFs-CAFs conversion, we triple transfected anti-miR-1, anti-miR-206 and pre-miR-31 in NFs (hereinafter referred to as \"NFs-TM\") to modify NFs into CAFs-like fibroblasts. We observed that NFs-TM significantly enhanced migration and colony formation ability of co-cultured LCCs. Similarly, restoration of miR-1, miR-206 and knockdown of miR-31 levels in CAFs (hereinafter referred to as \"CAFs-TM\") impaired the ability of CAF-induced migration and colony formation of co-cultured LCCs (Fig 2A and 2B). These results suggested that deregulation of these three miRNAs could promote NFs converting to CAFs or at least to CAFs-like fibroblasts. Similar cell migration and colony formation results were also obtained when CAFs and NFs from sample ID 7, 11, 15 were applied in co-culture (S4 Fig). Thus, CAFs and NFs from sample ID 1 will be mainly used in the following experiments. To study the effect of identified miRNAs on NFs-CAFs conversion in vivo, A549 cells were subcutaneously injected alone or co-injected with NFs-Scr, NFs-TM, CAFs-TM, or CAFs-Scr into immunodeficient mice. We found that both NFs-TM and CAFs-Scr dramatically enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis when compared to NFs-Scr and A549-alone. The CAFs-promoted tumor growth and angiogenesis effect was abolished by up- and down- expression of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in CAFs (CAFs-TM). No statistical significance in tumor weights was observed between NFs-Scr and A549-alone (Fig 2C and 2D). We assessed the cancer cell and fibroblasts fractions in mouse xenograft tumor by immunofluorescence staining using an antibody specific for human vimentin, which A549 cells fail to express. We found that green fluorescence signal, as an indicator of the fibroblast population, was significantly higher in CAFs-Scr and NFs-TM co-injection than A549-alone, NFs-Scr and CAFs-TM co-injection (S5 Fig). These results suggested that the original fibroblast populations CAFs-Scr, NFs-Scr, CAFs-TM and NFs-TM commingled with cancer cells contributed to the tumors. All fibroblasts survived and even proliferated in tumors together with cancer cells. CAFs-Scr and NFs-TM were more competent in enhancing A549 tumor growth. Similarly, several secreted factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), have been implicated as possible regulators for enhancing tumor growth. Using real-time PCR, we observed increased levels of VEGF, CCL2 and MMP9 in both CAFs-Scr- and NFs-TM co-injection than NFs-Scr and A549-alone (S6 Fig). Furthermore, mice bearing A549+CAFs-Scr and A549+NFs-TM tumors displayed a marked increase in the number of micro- and macro- scopic lung metastases compared with those in A549+NFs-Scr and A549-alone. However, no statistical significance in lung metastasis was observed between A549+CAFs-Scr and A549+CAFs-TM (Fig 2E). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known to promote tumor progression and malignancy. To compare TAMs infiltration in different tumor groups, we analyzed the presence of TAMs in single-cell suspensions from tumor tissues by flow cytometry assay for CSF-1R and F4/80 staining, two well-characterized markers of TAMs. We found that TAM infiltration was significantly higher in CAFs-Scr- and NFs-TM co-injection than NFs-Scr and A549-alone, suggesting that interaction of CAFs-Scr and NFs-TM with LCCs facilitates the recruitment of TAMs to lung tumors (Fig 2F).Function roles of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in NFs and CAFs.(A, B) NFs were triple transfected with anti-miR-1, anti-miR-206 and pre-miR-31 (NFs-TM) or CAFs were triple transfected with pre-miR-1, pre-miR-206 and anti-miR-31 (CAFs-TM). Cell migration assay was performed to assess LCCs migration efficiency in response to CM from co-cultured cells (A). Colony formation assay was performed to determine LCCs colony formation ability when co-cultured with NFs-Scr, NFs-TM, CAFs-TM, or CAFs-Scr (B). Cells transfected with miR-Scr were used as control. (C-F) A549cells were subcutaneously injected alone or co-injected with NFs-Scr, NFs-TM, CAFs-TM, or CAFs-Scr into immunodeficient mice. Xenografts were removed 6 weeks after implantation. Tumor weights were obtained and presented (C). Representative CD31-stained section of tumors. The blood vessels in tumor were stained using CD31 antibody and positive-stained blood vessels were counted in five areas with maximum number of microvessels under the microscope for each slide with 5 slides per experiment. The results are normalized to A549 group and presented as Mean \u00b1 SEM; (n = 8) (D). Representative haematoxylin-and eosin (HE)-stained section of lungs of mice bearing the indicated tumors. Lung sections were scanned and were scored for metastatic foci. Metastasis index (= metastasis number divided by primary tumor weight) (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 8) (E). The percentage of CSF-1R+F4/80+ in tumors was determined by flow cytometry assay (F) (mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 8). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001, NS indicated nonstatistical significance.CCL2 and VEGFA play a predominant role in CAFs-LCCs co-culture systemSecreted factors, such as VEGF, TGF-\u03b2, HGF and SDF-1, have been implicated as being important cell co-culture regulators. To better understand the crosstalk between NFs, CAFs and LCCs and to determine whether miRNA-reprogrammed NFs-TM can mimic CAFs in co-culture, the conditioned media (CM) from NFs-Scr-A549, CAFs-Scr-A549 and NFs-TM-A549 were screened for various cytokine, chemokine and growth factor levels using the Luminex-based BioPlex suspension array system. As shown in Fig 3A, 6 genes (CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8, bFGF, and VEGFA) were significantly up-regulated (at least 2.5-fold) in CM from CAFs-Scr-A549 and NFs-TM-A549 as compared with CM from NFs-Scr-A549. We noticed that the gene expression profile of NFs-TM-A549 was more similar to CAFs-Scr-A549 than NFs-Scr-A549, indicating miRNA-reprogrammed NFs-TM possesses some properties of CAFs. The top 5 soluble factors that demonstrated the highest up-regulation from cytokine expression profiles were selected for further study (CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGFA). To assess the contribution of each or a combination of the soluble factors to the functional role of lung cancer cells (migration and colony formation), LCCs were treated with a single or a combination of secreted factors. We observed that both single and combination treatment of secreted factors (CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, and IL-8) predominantly affected cancer cell migration but had no effect on colony formation (Fig 3B and 3C). The LCCs migration and colony formation were dramatically enhanced by the combination of (CCL2 and CCL5), but not (IL-6 and IL-8), with VEGFA when compared to VEGFA-alone treatment (Fig 3B and 3C). Notably, the promoting effect of CCL2/VEGFA combination was stronger than the combination of CCL5/VEGFA and was comparable to that of CCL2/CCL5/VEGFA combination or CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGFA combination, which was used as a positive control (Fig 3B and 3C). Furthermore, depletion of VEGFA, CCL5/VEGFA, CCL2/VEGFA, or CCL2/CCL5/VEGFA by adding neutralizing antibodies into CAFs-LCCs co-culture system resulted in reduction of LCCs migration (approximately 20%, 40%, 60%, and 63%) and colony formation (approximately 28%, 32%, 48%, and 52%), respectively, when compared to CM from CAFs and LCCs co-culture (Fig 3D and 3E). These results indicated that CCL2/VEGFA combined plays a major role in the synergistic interaction between CAFs and LCCs, although CCL5 may also be involved in this process with a weaker effect when compared to CCL2.CCL2/VEGFA plays major roles in CAFs and LCCs co-cultured system.(A) A549 was co-cultured with NFs-Scr, NFs-TM, or CAFs-Scr for 48 h. The levels of various factors in the cell-free culture supernatants were measured by Bio-Plex cytokine array. All cytokines levels were normalized to the levels of IL-1\u03b1 in the CM of NFs-Scr-A549 co-culture. The relative levels of each cytokine were compared to the particular cytokine. Date is shown as fold induction of triplicates. (B,C) Cell migration assay and Colony formation assay was performed to determine LCCs cell migration and colony formation ability when treated with indicated secreted factor(s). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001. (D,E) Cell migration assay and Colony formation assay was performed to determine LCCs cell migration and colony formation ability when treated with CAFs-LCCs co-cultured CM with addition of antibodies as indicated. The NFs-LCCs co-cultured CM was used as control. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001. # < 0.001 indicate CAFs-LCCs vs NFs-LCCs coculture. (F) CAFs-shScr were cocultured with A549-shScr cells or A549-shCCL2/VEGFA; or CAFs-shCCL2/VEGFA cells or NFs-shScr cells were cocultured with A549-shScr for 2 days. The medium was subjected to CCL2 or VEGFA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. **p < 0.001.Folkman et al., reported that although VEGF can be released by cancer cells themselves, fibroblasts and inflammatory cells are the principal source of host-derived VEGF. Fibroblasts are also the main source of CCL2 in response to tissue injury, cytokine stimulation, and cancer cell interaction. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the differences in cytokine secretion (VEGF and CCL2) in the CM are caused by CAFs. To verify this hypothesis, we generated stable CAFs-shCCL2/VEGF or A549-shCCL2/VEGF double knock-down cell lines and CAFs-shScr or A549-shScr cell lines, as controls. We individually co-cultured CAFs-shCCL2/VEGF or A549-shCCL2/VEGF with either A549-shScr or CAFs-shScr. Only the depletion of CCL2 and VEGF expression in CAFs resulted in a great reduction of CCL2 and VEGF levels in the CM indicating that the up-regulation of CCL2 and VEGF in the co-culture was mainly secreted by CAFs (Fig 3F).Identification of CCL2, VEGFA, and FOXO3a as functional targets of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31To investigate the molecular mechanisms of how miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 affect NFs-CAFs conversion, we searched several well-developed miRNAs algorithms and obtained a list of possible mRNA targets of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31. Among the search results, CCL2, VEGFA and FOXO3a captured our attention based on the following reasons. Fig 3A\u20133E results indicated that CCL2 and VEGFA play critical roles in CAFs and LCCs co-culture system. FOXO3a is known as a tumor suppressor which functions as a trigger for apoptosis. CCL2 and VEGFA, and FOXO3a were predicted to contain seed matches for miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31, respectively (Fig 4A). Since VEGFA has been reported as a target of miR-1 and miR-206, we focused on verifying CCL2 by miR-1 and miR-206 and FOXO3a by miR-31. Luciferase reporter constructs were made to contain the putative binding sites of CCL2 or FOXO3a 3\u2019-UTR wild-type regions (WT), or with 3 nucleotide substitutes in their 3\u2019-UTR regions (Mut). Co-transfection of CCL2-WT and CCL2-Mut constructs with miR-1, miR-206 or scramble miRNA into 293T cells showed that both miR-1 and miR-206 suppressed CCL2 wild type, but not mutant reporter activities (Fig 4B). Furthermore, over-expression of miR-1, miR-206 decreased CCL2 and VEGFA levels; whereas down-regulation of miR-1, miR-206 increased CCL2 and VEGFA levels in CAFs (Fig 4C). Similar effects of miR-31 on targeting FOXO3a were observed (Fig 4D). Taken together, these results suggested that CCL2/ VEGFA and FOXO3a are direct targets of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31, respectively.CCL2/VEGFA and FOXO3a are direct targets of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31.(A) The alignment of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 putative binding sites in CCL2/VEGFA and FOXO3a 3\u2019-UTR regions show complementary base pairings of miR-1, miR-206 with CCL2/VEGFA and miR-31 with FOXO3a 3\u2019-UTR reporter constructs. (B) The reporter constructs were co-transfected into the 293T cells with pre-miR-1, pre-miR-206, pre-miR-31 or miR-Scr and \u03b2-gal plasmid. After 48 h, the relative luciferase activity was determined by the ratio of luciferase to \u03b2-gal activity, and normalized to that of the control. (C) CAFs were transfected with single- or both- pre-miR-1 and pre-miR-206; NFs were transfected with single- or both- anti-miR-1 and anti-miR-206 and were co-cultured with A549 for 48h. Levels of CCL2 and VEGFA in CM were measured in triplicate by ELISA assay kit. (D) NFs (upper panel) or CAFs (lower panel) were transfected with pre-miR-31, anti-miR-31 or control (pre-miR-Scr or anti-miR-Scr) for 48h, respectively. The expression of FOXO3a was measured by western blotting assay. (E) A549 was co-cultured with CAFs infected by lentivirus carrying FOXO3a or GFP as control. Levels of CCL2 and VEGFA in CM were measured in triplicate by ELISA assay kit. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.001.FOXO3a negatively regulates VEGFA expression at transcriptional level. Indeed over-expression of FOXO3a decreased VEGFA levels but not affect CCL2 levels (Fig 4E). Furthermore, the expression levels of VEGFA, but not CCL2, were increased in CM when miR-31 was overexpressed in NFs, and were attenuated with miR-31-knockdown CAFs (S7 Fig). These results suggested that miR-31 indirectly affects VEGFA expression in co-cultures via targeting FOXO3a. FOXO3a over-expression did not significantly affect CAFs cell apoptosis and cell proliferation (S8A\u2013S8D Fig). Over-expression of FOXO3a in CAFs did not change LCCs migration, but significantly impaired LCCs colony formation and this inhibition effect can be rescued by the addition of VEGFA (S9A and S9B Fig). These results suggested that FOXO3a modulates VEGFA expression in fibroblasts to affect tumor microenvironment.Targeting CCL2 and VEGFA provides potential therapeutic application to treat lung tumorsTo test whether CCL2 and VEGFA are sufficient targets of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31-reprogrammed NFs-CAFs conversion, we performed CCL2/VEGFA loss- and gain-of-function experiments in co-culture. As shown in Fig 5A and 5B, the NFs-TM-promoted LCCs migration and colony formation effect was blocked by the addition of anti-CCL2/VEGFA in co-culture, whereas CAFs-TM-induced the inhibition effect on LCCs migration and colony formation can be rescued by the additional of CCL2 and VEGFA in co-culture. Furthermore, over-expression of CCL2 and VEGFA in NFs significantly enhanced LCCs migration and colony formation, which could be abolished by the addition of anti-CCL2/VEGFA in co-culture. Similarly, applying recombinant CCL2 and VEGFA in co-culture were sufficient to restore the effect of si-CCL2/VEGFA-inhibited LCCs migration and colony formation (S10A and S10B Fig). These results strongly suggest that miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 reprogram NFs-CAFs conversion via affecting CCL2/VEGFA expression.Targeting CCL2/VEGFA via antibodies or miRNAs administration inhibits lung tumor growth.(A) NFs-Scr, NFs-TM, CAFs-TM, or CAFs-Scr was co-cultured with LCCs for 48h and CM was collected. CM from LCCs-NFs-TM co-culture was treated with or without anti-CCL2/VEGFA; CM from LCCs-CAFs-TM co-culture was treated with or without CCL2/VEGFA. Cell migration assay was performed to assess LCCs migration efficiency in response to those CM. (B) Colony formation assay was performed to determine LCCs colony formation ability when co-cultured with NFs-Scr, NFs-TM, CAFs-TM, or CAFs-Scr with or without addition of anti-CCL2/VEGFA or CCL2/VEGFA as indicated in the Figure B. (C-F) A549 cells were subcutaneously co-injected with CAFs into immunodeficient mice. For neutralizing antibodies treatment, after 7 days of tumor implantation, the mice were treated with mouse IgG or anti-mouse CCL2 and/or anti-VEGF 164 at 2 mg/kg/dose by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) injections twice weekly for up to 6 weeks (C).

To investigate the therapeutic effect of CCL2- and/or VEGFA-neutralizing antibodies or single- or triple-miRNAs delivery on lung tumor growth, we applied injection of CCL2- and/or VEGFA-neutralizing antibodies or formulated miRNAs. We administered CCL2- and/or VEGFA-neutralizing antibodies by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections or formulated miRNAs by intravenous (i.v.) tail vein injection to BALB/c athymic nude mice bearing pre-established lung tumors. As shown in Fig 5C\u20135F, i.p. delivery of anti-CCL2, anti-VEGFA and anti-CCL2/VEGFA combination dramatically reduced lung tumor growth, angiogenesis, TAMs accumulation, and tumor metastasis in mice. More importantly, the anti-CCL2/VEGFA combination exerted a synergetic effect as compared to anti-CCL2 or anti-VEGFA alone. Similarly, triple- and double-miRNA delivery resulted in a significant reduction of tumor burden, angiogenesis, TAMs accumulation, and tumor metastasis compared to animals receiving single miRNAs (Fig 5G\u20135J). The up- and down- regulation of miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 in the tumor microenvironment (mixture of fibroblasts and tumor cells) were confirmed by Taqman qRT-PCR (S11 Fig). Interestingly, the expression of CCL2 and VEGFA was markedly lower in triple- and double-miRNA delivery tumors compared with that in single miRNA tumors (S12 Fig).DiscussionThe cancer-promoting role of CAFs is unambiguously established. CAFs are responsible for the synthesis, deposition and remodeling of ECM in tumor stroma, and also secrete paracrine growth factors that influence the growth of carcinoma. However, it is largely unknown how quiescent fibroblasts are transformed into CAFs. To address this question, we compared miRNAs expression profiles between CAFs and NFs from the same lung cancer patients and applied fibroblast-cancer cell co-culture system to verify these findings in vitro. Our results suggested that altering the expression of three miRNAs (miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31) contributes to NFs converting into CAFs. Down-regulation of miR-1 and miR-206 and up-regulation of miR-31 in NFs (NFs-TM) promoted lung cancer cell migration and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo when compared to NFs-Scr, and reversing the expression of these miRNAs in CAFs (CAFs-TM) blocked the enhanced LCCs migration, colony formation and tumor growth seen when using CAFs-Scr, providing evidence that miRNAs play an important role in reprogramming NFs into CAF-like fibroblasts that possess tumor-promoting functions. We note, however, that CAFs-TM only partially but not statistical significantly inhibit tumor lung metastasis and TAMs recruitment in the primary site of tumors compared to CAFs-Scr. One potential explanation is that the expression levels of CCL5, an important chemokine for cancer cells metastasis and macrophage infiltration, were not affected in CAFs-TM compared to CAFs-Scr. Thus, residual levels of CCL5 may partially contribute to this phenomenon.Comparing the cytokine expression profile of conditioned media from NFs-Scr-A549, CAFs- Scr-A549 and NFs-TM-A549, we identified the top five up-regulated cytokines (CCL2, CCL5, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGFA) that are commonly up-regulated in CM from CAFs- Scr-A549 and NFs-TM-A549 when compared with those from NFs-Scr-A549. By gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identified the combination of CCL2/VEGFA to play a predominant role in the promotion of LCCs migration and colony formation in CAFs-LCCs co-culture system. More importantly, we further demonstrated a novel link between CCL2/VEGFA up-regulation and miR-1, miR-206 suppression in co-cultured CAFs suggesting that CCL2 and VEGFA are directly targeted by miR-1, miR-206 through binding to their 3\u2019-UTR regions. CCL2 has been reported to function as a chemo-attractant, and VEGFA is an important cytokine involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth. Both are known to play important roles in progression and malignancy in multiple cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and lung cancer. Consistent with these findings, our results clearly show that CCL2 and VEGFA double-knockdown in CAFs decreases, whereas CCL2 and VEGFA over-expression in NFs increases LCCs migration and colony formation, indicating the critical roles of CCL2 and VEGFA in NFs-CAFs transformation. CCL2 also plays a crucial role in the recruitment of inflammatory macrophages to the tumor site and become TAMs that are suggested to enhance tumor malignancy. Interestingly, CCL2 overexpression induces tumor angiogenesis via TAMs, and VEGFA production in regions of hypoxia in growing tumors benefits TAM accumulation. Our results showed that tumors generated from CAFs- and NFs-TM- A549 commingled produced more pro-cancerous secreted factors than those generated from A549 cells alone, NFs- and CAFs-TM- commingled lung tumor. The VEGFA and CCL2 mainly released by fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment are responsible for tumor angiogenesis and TAMs accumulation, thereby boosting tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we found that FOXO3a, a well-known tumor suppressor, was down-regulated in CAFs compared with NFs. We further identified FOXO3a as a target of miR-31 and that up-regulation of miR-31 may contribute to the down-regulation of FOXO3a in CAFs. FOXO3a functions as a tumor suppressor gene mainly through triggering cell cycle arrest, repair of damaged DNA, and apoptosis. However, over-expression of FOXO3a did not significantly induce CAFs apoptosis and cell growth inhibition. The reason may be due to the relatively low growth rate of fibroblasts compared to cancer cells. Besides, fibroblasts cell cycle progression is also highly controlled by PTEN, which is commonly mutated in cancer cells. Considering that fibroblasts affect the function of cancer cells via paracrine, we suggested that FOXO3a functions as a tumor suppressor in fibroblasts and cancer cell co-culture through inhibition of VEGFA expression.We used two approaches to evaluate the potential therapeutic application of our current findings. One approach is to use a VEGFA neutralizing antibody injection. Interestingly, bevacizunb (a neutralizing antibody against VEGFA) has entered into phase II clinical trials for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treatment. We found that the combination of anti-VEGFA and anti-CCL2 yielded better suppression efficiency on tumor growth, angiogenesis, TAMs accumulation, and lung metastasis than either single antibody application. The other approach is using formulated miRNAs injection. MiRNA-based cancer treatments possess a number of advantages. MiRNAs can regulate a broad set of genes simultaneously and can modulate the tumor microenvironment affecting tumor cells and stroma. MiRNAs have shown reduced immune response and low toxicity when compared with lentivirus- or protein-based gene therapy. Our results clearly showed that the systemic delivery of anti-miR-31 and miR-1, miR-206 achieved a stronger anti-tumor progression effect than miR-1, miR-206 or anti-miR-31 treatment alone (Fig 6). These results suggest that combination strategy is a promising treatment of lung cancer in the future.A model of the miRNAs-reprogrammed NFs-CAFs transition.In this model, under the influence of cancer cells, down-regulation of miR-1, miR-206 and up-regulation of miR-31 expression contribute to conversion of NFs to CAFs. The reprogrammed NFs (NFs-TM) or CAFs exhibit more efficient than NFs and reprogrammed CAFs (CAFs-TM) in promoting co-cultured cancer cell migration, colony formation, as well as TAMs recruitment, tumor growth and angiogenesis through increasing secretion of cytokines (CCL2 and VEGFA).Materials and MethodsAntibodies and reagentsFOXO3a (sc-11351) and \u03b2-actin (sc-1616) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Fibronectin (ab23750), vimentin (ab92547), and \u03b1-SMA (ab7817) were purchased from Abcam (Massachusetts, US). CD31 (550274) were from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). Anti-Mouse CSF1R-PE (AFS98) and Anti-Mouse F4/80 Antigen-APC (BM8) were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA). CCL2 (279-MC), CCL5 (278-RN), IL-6 (206-IL), IL-8 (208-IL), and VEGFA (293-VE) were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).Cell culture and isolation of fibroblastHEK293T, A549 and H460 cells were purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). HEK 293T, A549 and H460 cells were maintained in a medium of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. NFs and CAFs were isolated as previously described. We isolated CAFs from 15 human lung carcinomas and their corresponding counterpart NFs from their matched non-malignant adjacent tissues, taken at least 10 cm from the outer tumor margin. Both CAFs and NFs expressed fibroblastic markers, such as fibronectin and vimentin. The expression of \u03b1-SMA were much stronger in CAFs than corresponding counterpart NFs. NFs and CAFs were maintained in 1:1 mixture of DMEM and F12 medium supplemented with 400 ng/ml hydrocortisone, 200 ng/ml insulin, 15% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C.Patients and tissues samplesA total of 15 paired fresh-frozen surgically resected lung tumors (8 adenocarcinomas, 6 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 larger cell carcinomas) and matched non-malignant adjacent tissues were obtained from the first affiliated hospital of Nanjing Medical University. The study protocol has been approved by Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital and Nanjing Medical University (approval No. 2015-SR-041). Participating subjects provided written informed consent Lung carcinoma samples and normal tissues were confirmed by a pathologist.Peripheral blood (10 ml) was drawn from each subject using standardized phlebotomy procedures. EDTA-Blood samples were collected without anti-coagulant and placed into two 5-ml red top vacutainers. After blood coagulation, serum was separated by centrifugation. All specimens were immediately frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For miRNAs levels analysis, 25 fmol of spiked-in cel-miR-39 (Applied Biosystems) was added in each plasma sample as an external control to monitor the quality of RNA extraction and normalization analysis.Quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysisCells were washed and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). The total proteins were separated by 8 or 10% gradients SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidenedifluoride membrane and blocked with 5% nonfat milk. Then the membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies and visualized with an enhanced chemiluminesence reagent.The expression levels of miRNAs were analyzed using Taqman MicroRNA Assay Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) specific for hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-206 and hsa-miR-31. Expression of RNU6B (U6 small nuclear RNA) was used as an endogenous control. Normalization strategy for analysis of serum levels of hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-206 and hsa-miR-31 were previously described. Briefly, the raw CT data for plasma miRNAs were first normalized using the CT RNU6B and then scaled to the spiked-in cel-miR-39 to correct for differences in extraction efficiency. To determine the quantity of VEGF, CCL2, MMP9, CCL5, and SDF-1 mRNA, the cDNA was amplified by real-time PCR with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and the housekeeping gene GAPDH was used as the internal control. A relative fold change in expression of the target gene transcript was determined using the comparative cycle threshold method (2\u2212\u0394\u0394CT). All experiments were performed in triplicate. All primers used are listed in S1 Table.Microarray hybridizationMicroarray hybridization was performed as previously described. Briefly, the miRCURY LNATM (Locked Nucleic Acid) microRNA version 11.0 microarray (Exiqon, Denmark, http://www.exiqon.com/microrna-microarray-analysis) was used, and each probe was repeated 4 times in the microarray. MiRNAs were labelled with Hy3TM or Hy5TM fluorescent groups using the miRCURYTM Array Power Labeling reagent kit to form fluorescent probes. The background was removed from the signal value, and scale normalization was done. The ratio between groups > 1.5 times or < 0.65 times, and a P value < 0.05 revealed by t test indicated the miRNAs were differentially expressed. The ratio > 1.5 times was defined as up-regulation, while the ratio < 0.65 times was defined as down-regulation.Luciferase reporter assayCCL2 and FOXO3a 3\u2019-UTRs containing predicted miR-1, miR-206 and miR-31 binding sites and corresponding mutant sites were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA (HEK293T cells) using pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, CA, USA), respectively. The PCR productions containing the wild-type or mutant putative target sites of the CCL2 and FOXO3a 3\u2019-UTR regions were inserted into untranslated region (UTR) downstream of the luciferase gene in the pMIR-reporter luciferase vector (Ambion). Cells were cotransfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with 200 ng of wild-type or mutant luciferase reporter plasmid, 100 ng of \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) plasmid, and 100 nmol of pre-miR-1, pre-miR-206, pre-miR-31 or negative control precursor. Luciferase activity was measured 48 hours after transfection using \u03b2-gal for normalization. Experiments were performed in triplicate in three independent experiments. All primers used are listed in S1 Table.Cell migration assayCell migration assays were performed using migration chambers. LCCs were co-cultured with CAFs or NFs in complete medium at a ratio 1:1, in 24-well plates for 24 hours. LCCs cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with serum-free medium. Cells that had not migrated were removed from the interior sides of the chamber by cotton swabs. The exterior sides were fixed with 100% cold methanol and stained with crystal violet. Cells were counted under a microscope.Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysisTumor samples were fixed with Z-Fix solution (Anatech LTD, MI, USA) for 24 h and processed by the paraffin-embedded method. The tissues sections (5 mm thick) were then heat-immobilized or pepsin-immobilized according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Antibodies against vimentin or CD31 were used for the immunostaining and detected through the Dako Envision two-step method of immunohistochemistry (Carpinteria, CA, USA). The relative angiogenesis levels were calculated by microvessel density (MVD) as described. In short, slides were first scanned under low power (\u00d740) in order to determine three areas with the maximum number of microvessels that were consequently evaluated at \u00d7 200 magnifications.For immunofluorescence assay, samples were stained with fibronectin, vimentin, and \u03b1-SMA after blocking with bovine serum albumin. Samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody (red) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (green) (Life technologies, Frederick, MD, USA). Microscopic observation was performed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).Propidium iodide and Annexin V stainingCells were washed and resuspended in HEPES buffer containing recombinant PI and Annexin V-FITC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The stained cells were analyzed with flow cytometry.Colony formation assayFor colony formation assay, 1 ml of 0.5% SeaPlaque agarose (BMA, ME, USA) was added to each well of 6-well plates. After solidation, 5 \u00d7 103 cells were mixed with 2 ml of 0.5% SeaPlaque agarose and added onto the top of the well. The CM were added to the wells and be replaced by every two days. After 12 days of culture, colonies were fixed with 100% methanol for 15 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies with diameter more than 1.5 mm were counted.TAMs analysis in tumor tissuesTumor tissue was minced and digested with dissociation buffer (100 U/ml Collagenase type IV and 100 \u03bcg/ml DNase in RPMI + 10% FBS) in a shaking incubator at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Digested tissues were filtered through 70-\u03bcm cell strainers. Cells were incubated with Fc Block. To identify TAMs, cells were stained with CSF1R-PE and F4/80-APC at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Unstained control and single-stained cells were prepared in every experiment for gating. Dead cells were gated out by side-scatter and forward-scatter analysis.Transfection of pre-miRNAs or anti-miRNA inhibitorsThe cells were seeded 24 hours, and transfected with 100 nM of miRNA precursors or 100 nM anti-miRNA inhibitors (Ambion, TX, USA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The expression levels of miRNAs were verified by stem-loop qRT-PCR. Cells transfected with scramble oligonucleotides were used as a negative control.Construction of stable expression cell linesLentiviruses were generated by transfection of HEK293T cells with transducing vector and packaging vectors. Virus particles in the medium were initially harvested after 24 h and harvested every 12 or 24 h thereafter. Collected virus particles were filtered and transduced into target cells. Cells underwent two rounds of selection with appropriate antibiotics. Lentiviral plasmids expressing shScr, shCCL2, and shVEGFA were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Lentiviral plasmids expressing CCL2, VEGFA and FOXO3a were obtained from GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD).Cytokines immunoarrays and ELISA assayThe levels of cytokines, growth factors and chemokines in the culture media were assessed by Bio-PlexPro human cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor array (Bio-Rad Life Sciences, CA, USA) using a Luminex 100 plate reader (Bio-Rad Life Sciences, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. CCL2 and VEGFA protein levels in CM were measured by ELISA kits (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.Mouse xenograft models4\u20136 week aged nude mice of the BALB/c strain were purchased from the Nanjing General Hospital of Nanjing Military Command (Nanjing, China). All nude mice were raised in and all experiments were conducted under SPF-level barrier system. A549 tumor cells (1\u00d7106) were commingled with fibroblasts (NFs or CAFs), and mixed with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD Lifesciences) and injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each animal. Primary tumors and lung tissues were harvested from mice after 6 weeks after injection. Lungs were paraffin-embedded and serial sections were histologically examined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain.For quantitation of lung tumor foci, tumor numbers of 5 serial sections per lung were counted and totaled. The lung metastasis index for each mouse was calculated as the ratio of the number of foci colonies observed in the lungs divided by the mass of the primary tumor (in grams) and normalized to WT as fold changes. (Mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 8).For neutralizing antibodies (R&D system) treatment, mice received i.p injections of single or combination of anti-mouse CCL2 (MAB-497), anti-mouse VEGF164 (AF-493) or mouse IgG isotype control (MAB002) twice a week starting on day 7 after tumor cell implantation for up to 6 weeks (2 mg/kg/dose). For miRNAs injection treatment, miRNAs were formulated with MaxSuppressor in vivo RNALancerII (Bioo Scientific, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Each does contained 20\u03bcg of formulated oligo, which equals 1 mg/kg per mouse with an average weight of 20g.

Unfortunately, in most cases, cancers that respond to tamoxifen in advanced disease settings will eventually relapse and become tamoxifen resistant. Recurrence in patients treated with tamoxifen in adjuvant settings is also a frequent event. Over the years, a number of molecular mechanisms have been proposed for tamoxifen resistance. Both ER-independent alternative signaling pathways that support tumor cell growth and ER-mediated mechanisms have been proposed. Although several possibilities have been found to account for or contribute to the resistant phenotype in patients, the precise mechanisms responsible for acquired or intrinsic antiestrogen resistance of breast tumors are still poorly understood.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A occurs in a number of isoforms, with the 165-amino-acid isoform being the most common form secreted by tumor cells, which acts on endothelial cells, and is responsible for tumor angiogenesis. Two important VEGF receptors, VEGF-R1 (Flt-1) and VEGF-R2 (Flk-1/KDR) membrane tyrosine kinases, mediate VEGF signaling. A third VEGF receptor, neuropilin-1 (NP-1), which lacks an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, presumably facilitates signal transduction as a coreceptor by associating with other membrane receptors. Clinical studies have shown that elevated levels of VEGF-A165 are associated with shorter progression-free survival and shorter survival following relapse in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving tamoxifen as a first line therapy. Elevated VEGF levels are also associated with shorter relapse and overall survival in patients with ER-positive, lymph node\u2013positive disease receiving adjuvant tamoxifen. Although a number of studies have shown the importance of VEGF as a prognostic indicator of the severity of breast cancer, direct evidence showing the ability of VEGF to enhance tamoxifen resistance is lacking.As a stimulator of neoangiogenesis, VEGF plays an important role in the expansion of the metastatic tumor mass. The initial steps of metastasis (i.e., intravasation, accessing distant organs through hematogenous circulation, and vascular bed adhesion in distant organs) can be done by tumor cells with high efficiency. However, the subsequent steps, extravasation at the distant site and proliferation in the parenchyma of the target organ to develop macroscopic metastatic lesions, are inefficient and limiting steps in the metastatic process. Recent results have shown a role for VEGF in tumor cell extravasation. Mobilization of VEGF-R1\u2013expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells is also needed to establish a \u201cpremetastatic niche\u201d for the arriving tumor cells. Thus, VEGF might have significant roles not only in the vascularization of the metastasis but also in \u201cpreangiogenic\u201d stages at these sites.In human solid tumors, a high level of desmoplasia is also commonly observed at both primary and metastatic sites, wherein stroma composes the majority of the tumor mass, in some cases accounting for more than 90%. The importance of the stromal response in supporting tumor growth has now been substantiated by a number of studies, although induction of desmoplasia is still poorly understood. Several mechanisms that result in stromal fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis have been proposed, including paracrine activation of fibroblast proliferation by growth factors released by tumor cells. Various growth factors secreted from cancer cells have been identified that stimulate stromal cells including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, and insulin-like growth factors (IGF; refs.). However, the role of VEGF in the desmoplastic response has not been studied. In this report, we show that VEGF overexpression was also able to increase the level of desmoplasia in the primary tumors. Collectively, our findings suggest that VEGF overexpression in ER-positive breast cancer cells increases tumor-stromal interactions and facilitates a suitable stromal environment at the metastatic site, where the cancer cells thrive and form large nodules even in mice treated with tamoxifen.Materials and MethodsVector constructionsThe construction of the pBTE bicistronic expression vector for the reverse tet transactivator rtTA2S-M2 has previously been described. The tet-responsive VEGF expression vector pTRE-hVEGF was constructed by subcloning VEGF cDNA, including the NH2-terminal secretory signal peptide sequences, into the pTRE vector (Clontech) at the EcoRI site.C9V cell lines and VEGF expressionIsolation of the MCF-7\u2013derived subline C9, which stably expresses the reverse tet transactivator rtTA2S-M2, has been described before. C9 cells were retransfected with the pTRE-hVEGF and pZeo-SV (Invitrogen) plasmids. Zeocin-resistant cell clones, designated as C9V cell lines, were isolated and expanded for evaluation of doxycycline-induced VEGF induction by ELISA and Western blot analysis and also for evaluation of their growth characteristics, which needed to be similar to the parental MCF-7 clone ML20 under different stimulations, including 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen, and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS).Animal experimentsAll studies were done according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Southern Research Institute. Ovariectomized athymic nude mice, ~8 wk old, were obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. For xenograft experiments, tumor volume (Vt) was determined by Vt (mm3) = L \u00d7 W2/2, where L and W refer to the larger and smaller dimensions of each tumor measurement, respectively. At the end of the experiment, the tumor was excised and cut into two halves, one was stored in liquid nitrogen for biochemical analyses and the other was fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded for histologic analysis.5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside stainingMouse tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 4 to 5 h, stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\u03b2-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining solution overnight in the dark at room temperature, and then rinsed with PBS. After examining the blue-stained metastatic lesions under a dissecting microscope, photographs were taken and the tissue samples were further fixed in 10% formalin overnight and then paraffin embedded for histologic analysis. In some experiments, lung and tumor samples were directly fixed and paraffin embedded for immunohistologic analysis. The X-gal staining solution contained 5 mmol/L potassium ferricyanide, 5 mmol/L potassium ferrocyanide, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.02% NP40, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mg/mL X-gal.Determination of tumor VEGF and fibroblast growth factor-2 levelsTumor samples stored in liquid nitrogen were thawed, dissected free of surrounding fat tissue, and minced into small pieces. Cytosolic preparation buffer [10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1.5 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L sodium molybdate, 1.0 mmol/L 1-thioglycerol] was added at 0.5 mL to every 100-mg tissue sample. The tissue was homogenized on ice with a Polytron homogenizer and disintegrated by sonication. The samples were spun at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The cytosol samples collected from the supernatant were used for VEGF and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 content determination by ELISA (R&D Systems). Protein concentration was also determined by the modified Lowry protein assay (Pierce).Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysisFor quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), mRNA was isolated using mRNACatcher (Invitrogen) and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Aliquots of the cDNA combined in a 20-\u00b5L reaction mix containing 300 nmol/L 5\u2032 forward and 3\u2032 reverse primers of each receptors and 100 nmol/L double fluorescently labeled MGB (minor groove binding) probe were subjected to quantitative PCR analysis on 384-plate (Applied Biosystems). The PCR primers for VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, and NP-1 are described in ref..Statistical methodsTumor volumes (in cubic millimeters) were calculated for each treatment group and are represented as mean \u00b1 SE. The tumor growth pattern was characterized over time. These patterns were analyzed using the growth curve modeling method. One-way ANOVA, t test, and tests of repeated measures were used to compare the mean tumor volumes between groups. All of the analyses were done using SAS software (version 6.12; SAS Institute, Inc.). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all of the analyses.ResultsInduction of VEGF expression to clinically relevant levels accelerates xenograft growth in a dose-dependent mannerDoxycycline-inducible gene expression systems are useful for controlling expression of targeted genes and for determining functions of gene products both in vitro and in vivo. We generated a bicistronic expression vector using a modified reverse tet-transactivator (rtTA2S-M2), which showed homogeneous inducible gene expression over long periods, high doxycycline sensitivity, and minimal basal activity in the absence of doxycycline. Using this system, we engineered the ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer line to overexpress the 165-amino-acid form of VEGF-A in a doxycycline-regulated manner. The resulting cell lines were designated as C9V lines. Western blotting of conditioned media collected from two C9V clones, C9V4 and C9V18, showed tightly controlled VEGF secretion by addition of doxycycline (Fig. 1). Noninduced basal VEGF levels are undetectable in this assay, which is similar to untransfected parental MCF-7 cells and to the parental C9 cells that are only transfected with the tet-transactivator expression vector. The upper band of VEGF in Fig. 1 with a higher molecular weight is most likely due to posttranslational modifications, consistent with other studies. More sensitive ELISA assays done with conditioned media showed that doxycycline at 0.2 \u00b5g/mL induced an ~100-fold increase in VEGF secretion from both C9V4 and C9V18 cell cultures in 48 hours (data not shown).C9V4 cells were then inoculated into the mammary fat pad of ovariectomized nude mice on day 0. One day before the cell inoculation, all mice were implanted with slow-release E2 pellet and divided into four groups receiving different doses of doxycycline in their drinking water. By day 50, tumors in control group grew to a mean size of 400 mm3 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the average tumor volumes were about 730 and 1,200 mm3 in groups that were supplied with a low (0.05 mg/mL) and high (0.2 mg/mL) dose of doxycycline, respectively. Thus, doxycycline given in drinking water significantly increased tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). In another mouse group, when the high dose of doxycycline was withdrawn at day 11, the tumor growth rate was reduced significantly in comparison with the tumor growth observed in the group that continued to receive the same dose of doxycycline throughout the experiment (P < 0.01).Tumor VEGF content was determined by ELISA of lysates prepared from individual tumor samples collected at the end of the animal study. The continuous low and high doses of doxycycline increased average tumor VEGF content by 14- and 58-fold, respectively. The mean tumor volumes in these groups correlated with the VEGF levels and dosage of doxycycline (Fig. 2B). Most importantly, the doxycycline-regulated tumor VEGF levels in these groups fall within the range of cytosolic VEGF levels found in biopsy samples from breast cancer patients with significantly shorter progression-free survival and post-relapse survival times after first-line tamoxifen treatment for advanced disease. In this study of 618 breast cancer patients, tumors from the group of 78 patients that were the least responsive to tamoxifen treatment had a high level of VEGF ranging from 1.73 to 542 ng/mg of cytosolic protein. The mean VEGF levels in our experimental system were 3 and 12 ng/mg, induced by the low-dose and high-dose doxycycline, respectively. The basal level of tumor VEGF was 0.17 ng/mg in the control group that did not receive doxycycline. Thus, the VEGF levels in our model system are clinically relevant and correspond to the range that is associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients with advanced disease.Tumor microvessel density was characterized by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody against the mouse endothelial cell\u2013specific marker platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). As expected, an increased microvessel density was readily observed in xenografts where VEGF expression was induced by doxycycline (Fig. 2C). This result is consistent with clinical studies showing that human breast tumors with elevated VEGF levels are associated with increased microvessel density and is also consistent with other reported in vivo studies.Induction of VEGF expression is associated with reduced tamoxifen efficacy in vivo and acquisition of metastatic capabilityWe next studied C9V xenograft growth in nude mice that were treated with tamoxifen. Four groups of ovariectomized mice were supplemented with slow-release E2 pellets and then inoculated with C9V18 cells on day 0. Two of four groups were given doxycycline in their drinking water to induce VEGF expression in the tumors starting one day before the inoculation. Two groups of mice, one with doxycycline and the other without, received tamoxifen treatment by replacing the E2 pellet with a tamoxifen pellet on day 9 when the tumors were ~200 mm3 in size. Tumors in tamoxifen-treated mice that did not receive doxycycline became static and eventually regressed (Fig. 3A). In contrast, tumors in tamoxifen-treated mice that received doxycycline continued to grow. Induction of VEGF expression by doxycycline increased tumor growth significantly in both tamoxifen-treated mice (group 3 versus group 1; P < 0.01) and E2-suplemented mice (group 4 versus group 2; P < 0.01). Xenografts established with another C9V cell line, C9V4, also showed similar results (data not shown).Tumor samples collected from this study were subjected to immunostaining with a specific antibody against a cell proliferation marker, Ki-67. VEGF expression increased the number of Ki-67\u2013positive cells in tamoxifen-treated tumors (Fig. 3B). On an average, the number of Ki-67\u2013positive cells was increased ~2-fold when VEGF expression was induced. Together, the results depicted in Fig. 3A and B seem to be the first direct in vivo evidence that VEGF expression drives ER-positive, tamoxifen-responsive breast cancer to become less sensitive to tamoxifen treatment. Tumors in the group where VEGF was induced and also received tamoxifen treatment (group 3) seemed to grow even larger than those in the group that received only continued E2 supplement (group 2), although this trend did not quite meet statistical significance (P = 0.1). Comparing tumor growth in two groups that continued to receive E2 also indicates that the effect of VEGF expression on tumor growth might be additive to that of estrogen on ER-positive breast tumors as has previously been reported by others.Although the MCF-7 cell line was originally isolated from a metastatic breast cancer, it lacks the ability to form either macroscopic or microscopic metastasis in vivo. We therefore examined the effect of VEGF overexpression on the metastatic potential of C9 cells, which are a derivative of a MCF-7 subline, ML20, which was stably transfected with the bacterial lacZ gene encoding \u03b2-galactosidase. This allows X-gal staining of mouse tissues to detect metastatic lesions in different organs. X-gal staining of mouse lungs showed that the induction of tumor VEGF overexpression resulted in spontaneous lung metastases in the orthotopically implanted xenograft-bearing mice (Fig. 3C). Lung tissue H&E staining confirmed metastasis indicated by X-gal staining. VEGF induced lung metastases were observed in both E2-supplemented mice and mice that received tamoxifen treatment. Metastases in lymph nodes, liver, kidney, and femur were not observed. The incidence of lung metastases detected by X-gal staining in tumor-bearing mice is summarized in Table 1. When doxycycline was given to induce VEGF expression, lung metastases were observed in six of nine E2-supplemented mice and four of nine tamoxifen-treated mice (including both C9V4 and C9V18 xenografts). No lung metastases were observed in 18 mice that did not receive doxycycline in their drinking water. There were also no metastases detected in the group of six mice where VEGF overexpression was down-regulated by removal of doxycycline on day 11, although most of these tumors were of the same size or larger than some of the primary tumors in the doxycycline- and tamoxifen-treated groups that did give rise to metastases. Therefore, the exclusive presence of metastases in mice that underwent continued induction of VEGF expression is not simply a function of the larger mean tumor size observed in these groups. These results show that VEGF overexpression is sufficient to cause a nonmetastatic breast tumor to become metastatic.VEGF promotes in vivo growth through paracrine signaling mechanisms associated with the induction of a desmoplastic responseTo determine if the reduced tamoxifen efficacy observed in vivo with the VEGF-inducible transfected cell lines was related to either a possible reduction of ER\u03b1 expression levels or reduction of in vitro sensitivity to antiestrogens, we examined protein expression of ER\u03b1 by Western blotting and the in vitro growth characteristics of these lines. Protein expression levels of ER\u03b1 in C9, C9V4, C9V18, and the parental lacZ-transfected MCF-7 cell lines were all similar (data not shown). In addition, the in vitro growth characteristics of the C9V cell lines were similar to their parental MCF-7 cell line in either estrogen- or antiestrogen-containing conditions, and addition of doxycycline to the cultures had no effect on estrogen responsiveness or antiestrogen sensitivity (data not shown). These results indicate that an alteration in ER status or function is not related to the reduction of tamoxifen efficacy observed in vivo in this experimental system.Direct effects of VEGF on C9V cell proliferation and sensitivity to tamoxifen were examined by an in vitro cell proliferation assay. The results showed that in the presence and absence of recombinant human VEGF, C9V18 and the parental ML20 cell line grew at a similar rate and remained equally sensitive to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, an active metabolite of tamoxifen used for in vitro studies (Fig. 4A). These experiments showed that VEGF has no direct effect on C9V18 cells with respect to proliferation and sensitivity to tamoxifen, consistent with our finding that the MCF-7 derivative cell line ML20, C9V4, or C9V18 had non-detectable expression of VEGF receptor R1 and R2 proteins by Western blotting and ELISA (data not shown) or quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4B). The third VEGF receptor, NP-1, was found to be expressed in both C9V cell lines and ML20 cell line. Because NP-1 lacks intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, it is likely that NP-1 by itself is not a functional receptor for VEGF. Because VEGF was able to stimulate C9V18 cell proliferation in vivo resulting in tamoxifen-resistant tumor growth, and because VEGF had no effect on the same cell line in vitro on the cell growth or tamoxifen sensitivity, it can be concluded that the VEGF effect observed in this experimental system is mediated by a paracrine, rather than autocrine, signaling mechanism.It is well known that VEGF activates endothelial cells in the tumor environment. To study whether other cell types possibly mediate the paracrine signaling of VEGF involved in tamoxifen resistance and metastasis, the stromal content was delineated from the epithelial component by immunohistologic staining with a mixture of specific antibodies against the epithelial cell marker keratin, which was able to specifically label the C9V cells present within the tumor mass. The immunostaining results showed that VEGF expression significantly increased the stromal content in the tamoxifen-treated tumors. The stromal content associated with VEGF expression encompassed ~40% of tumor section areas as compared with only 10% of tumor areas when VEGF was not induced (Fig. 5A). Based on morphology, fibroblasts accounted for most of the stroma, which resembled desmoplasia, a clinical feature of human breast cancer. Activated stromal cells in the tumor environment can provide additional mitogenic stimuli to drive tumor growth.To begin to identify which stromal derived factors may be involved in promoting tamoxifen-resistant growth and metastasis, we examined FGF-2 levels in tumors from tamoxifen-treated mice by ELISA, as previous results from our laboratory linked FGF signaling to paracrine mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance. The results showed that the FGF-2 level was also increased by ~40% when tumor VEGF expression was induced by doxycycline (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the increase in FGF-2 levels possibly attributes to the increased fibroblastic stromal content within the xenografts. Because it has been reported that stromal cell\u2013derived factor 1 (SDF-1) is produced by carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, which also mimics the mitogenic effect of estrogen when added to MCF-7 cells in vitro, we also examined SDF-1 levels in tumor lysates by ELISA. However, unlike FGF-2, the levels of SDF-1 did not change when tumor VEGF expression was induced by doxycycline (data not shown), suggesting that SDF-1 levels were most likely not correlated with the observed reduction of tamoxifen efficacy in this experimental system.Overexpression of FGF family members as well as their receptors has been reported in a significant percentage of human breast tumors. FGF-1 and FGF-4 are both able to stimulate MCF-7 cell proliferation in the absence of the mitogenic stimulus provided by estrogen. The effect of FGF-2 on C9V18 cells was examined in the same experiment shown in Fig. 4A, which showed that VEGF had no effect on the in vitro growth of C9V18 cells. In contrast to VEGF, exogenous FGF-2 increased the proliferation of both tamoxifen-treated (FGF-2 + tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone; P < 0.01) and estrogen-depleted (FGF-2 versus control; P < 0.01) C9V18 cells. These results indicate that the stromal-derived FGF-2 possibly reduces tamoxifen sensitivity of C9V18 cells in vivo similar to that previously reported for FGF-1 and FGF-4. Tumor stroma is a rich resource of mitogenic growth factors and cytokines, which can stimulate tumor growth and confer drug resistance. The increased stroma content within VEGF-overexpressing tumors could be responsible for the observed reduction in tamoxifen efficacy.VEGF promotes metastatic colonization and desmoplasia in an experimental metastasis assayThe metastatic process consists of series of steps, all of which must be successfully completed to give rise to a metastatic lesion. A limiting step in this process is one wherein a cell disseminated from the primary tumor colonizes at a distant organ site. To investigate whether VEGF influences the step of colonization of disseminated tumor cells at a distant organ, C9V18 tumor cells were directly introduced into the mouse circulation by tail vein injection in an experimental metastasis assay. The presence of disseminated tumor cells in mouse lungs at various time points after the injection was visualized by immunostaining with antibodies against keratin. Two hours after the tail vein injection, many single tumor cells were present in the lungs taken from mice supplied either with or without doxycycline, confirming the success of the tail vein injection (Fig. 5C). Four weeks later, no tumor cells were detected in the lungs from the mice that did not receive doxycycline (n = 6), whereas keratin-positive C9V18 cell colonies were found in two of the three mice that were given doxycycline. Most interestingly, the tumor cell colonies were found to be densely surrounded by stromal cells. The small C9V18 cell colonies and their surrounding stroma were negative by immunostaining for the mouse endothelial cell marker PECAM-1, consistent with the idea that metastatic colonization occurred before angiogenesis. Histologic examination revealed that these stromal cells were fibroblasts, indicating that initiation of desmoplasia may precede angiogenesis.At 10 week s after tail vein injection, there were still no disseminated tumor cells or metastatic lesions in six mice that did not receive doxycycline, whereas two of the six mice treated with doxycycline developed macroscopic lung metastases. A mixed pattern of single tumor cells, tumor cell colonies, and metastatic lesions with a high level of desmoplasia was observed in the mouse lungs (Fig. 5C). Blood vessels were easily observed within the desmoplastic zone of metastatic lesions. Immunostaining with keratin antibodies showed that the majority of the area in the metastatic lesion was found to be occupied by desmoplastic stroma. Desmoplasia accounted for 50% to 90% of the total area of the lung metastatic lesions, similar to that found in the spontaneous metastatic lesions from orthotopically implanted tumor-bearing mice. These observations indicate that disseminated tumor cells that do not overexpress VEGF either undergo apoptosis or are cleared by macrophages and suggest that VEGF-overexpressing tumor cells are able to activate fibroblastic stroma, which then increases their potential for survival and colonization in a secondary organ before angiogenesis.DiscussionMCF-7 is an ER-positive breast cancer cell line that is unable to grow as a xenograft in ovariectomized mice without E2 supplementation. MCF-7 tumors also do not grow in tamoxifen-treated mice, are poorly invasive, and are unable to consistently disseminate to distant sites. Many attempts to increase its metastatic capabilities and to impart antiestrogen resistance have been made to develop models for the progression of human breast cancer. For instance, FGF-1 or FGF-4 overexpression in MCF-7 cells confers these cells with the ability to form highly vascularized tumors in tamoxifen-treated mice and also enhances their metastatic capabilities in the mice bearing these xenografts, exhibiting micrometastases in the lungs and lymph nodes. Overexpression of heregulin in MCF-7 induces antiestrogen resistance, promotes metastasis, and also induces preneoplastic transformation of the adjacent mouse mammary tissue. Whereas these cells exhibit lymphatic invasion and axillary lymph node metastases, no lung metastases were reported. It is suggested that heregulin imparts this aggressive phenotype on MCF-7, in part, via an increase in the expression of VEGF. Recently, angiopoietin-2 overexpression in MCF-7 tumors was also shown to stimulate angiogenesis and confer on these cells the ability to form lung metastases. As in the case of heregulin, angiopoietin-2 has also been suggested to stimulate angiogenesis via a VEGF-dependent mechanism.To directly address the role of VEGF in metastatic and antiestrogen resistance phenotypes, we developed a model system where VEGF expression in MCF-7 xenografts can be induced to clinically relevant levels for extended periods of time. This allowed us to study the biological effect of VEGF on tamoxifen resistance and metastasis in vivo. The results showed that overexpression of VEGF caused ER-positive breast tumors to grow in tamoxifen-treated mice, promoted metastatic colonization, and allowed the establishment of macroscopic lung metastases. VEGF expression in tumors also resulted in increased desmoplasia.A highly interesting and intriguing aspect of these findings is that VEGF imparts a more pronounced metastatic phenotype to these cells than FGF-1, another angiogenic growth factor frequently expressed in human breast cancer, which is as potent as VEGF in stimulating endothelial cell proliferation. Whereas both FGF-1\u2013 and VEGF-overexpressing MCF-7 xenografts are highly vascularized and both are quite capable of growing in tamoxifen-treated nude mice, the FGF-1\u2013overexpressing cells are incapable of establishing distant macrometastases owing to their inability to extravasate from blood vessels and proliferate in the parenchyma of organs such as the lungs. One reason for such a difference could be related to the critical role of VEGF receptor signaling in the establishment of a \u201cpremetastatic niche\u201d and subsequent neovascularization of these sites following tumor cell arrival. It has been shown that VEGF-R1\u2013expressing, bone marrow\u2013derived hematopoietic precursor cells home to sites in the target organ and precondition these sites before the arrival of tumor cells. VEGF-R2\u2013expressing circulating endothelial precursor cells are recruited to the nascent metastatic site as well. Preconditioning of these sites also involves VEGF-R1 signaling\u2013mediated production of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by activated macrophages and endothelial cells in the lung thereby facilitating tumor cell invasion on their arrival. Tumor-produced VEGF is also involved in the induction of expression of the chemokines S100A8 and S100A9 by myeloid and endothelial cells in the lung, which also facilitate the homing of tumor cells to this tissue and the establishment of a permissive environment for their docking and invasion. VEGF is also unique when compared with other angiogenic factors in that it also disrupts the endothelial barrier function, facilitating tumor cell extravasation.Although VEGF stimulates neovascularization, it is not clear how adequate oxygen and nutrient supply and waste product removal by blood circulation can be mechanistically linked directly with tamoxifen resistance. Previously reported studies indicate that mitogenic factors that can act in an autocrine as well as a paracrine manner, such as FGFs, are able to confer a tamoxifen-resistant phenotype to MCF-7 cells. In the present study, we have shown the presence of high levels of fibroblastic desmoplasia in the tumors from tamoxifen-treated mice only when VEGF expression is induced. Desmoplasia is rarely observed in xenograft models possibly due to the rapid overgrowth of epithelial tumor cells. Previous studies with H-ras\u2013transfected MCF-7 cells indicated that the desmoplasia observed in that system was only seen when estrogen was not provided and was related to PDGF production by the transfected cells. Whereas the effect of VEGF expression on PDGF production in MCF-7 cells remains to be determined, we have shown herein an increased FGF-2 level in xenograft tumors when VEGF expression was induced, concomitant with increased stromal content. We have also shown that exogenous FGF-2 can increase the growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro even when 4-hydroxytamoxifen is present. Therefore, the tamoxifen-resistant phenotype in this system could be, in part, a result of the direct effects of FGF-2 on MCF-7 cells. In addition to FGF-2, other growth factors, cytokines, or direct cell-cell interactions stimulated by VEGF paracrine signaling may also play a role in conferring tamoxifen resistance to breast tumor cells. Of particular interest is the recent finding that fibroblast-induced tamoxifen resistance of MCF-7 cells in a three-dimensional in vitro culture system that mimics the epithelial-fibroblast interactions that can occur in vivo is independent of IGF-I receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor signaling.Our investigation is the latest of a series of transfection studies that have explored the role of expression of various VEGF isoforms in ER-positive breast cancer cell lines. A consistent finding throughout all the studies reported thus far is the enhanced in vivo growth of VEGF-overexpressing xenografts in estrogen-supplemented animals. However, the effects on hormone dependence and antiestrogen sensitivity in vitro and in vivo have been variable depending on the particular study. Zhang and colleagues found that VEGF-A121 overexpression in MCF-7 tumors did not affect estrogen dependence or tamoxifen sensitivity. We have also previously shown that constitutive overexpression of VEGF in the same parental MCF-7 line that was also used herein failed to affect estrogen dependence in vitro or in vivo but did affect tamoxifen sensitivity in vivo. In contrast, Guo and colleagues recently reported that overexpression of either VEGF-A165 or VEGF-A121 in MCF-7 cells did promote estrogen-independent tumor growth in vitro or in vivo. Because additional transfected cell lines that produced less VEGF failed to exhibit an estrogen-independent phenotype, these authors attributed the phenotypic differences of their transfectants from those reported in other studies to differences in expression levels of VEGF, although VEGF levels in tumors were not measured. Owing to the lack of estrogen independence that we previously observed with our MCF-7 cells overexpressing VEGF in a constitutive manner, we did not directly address the question of estrogen independence in vivo in our inducible model. In addition, a direct comparison between our model and that described by Guo and colleagues cannot be made because the MCF-7 line used in their study expresses VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 mRNAs whereas our parental and transfected cells, MCF-7 derivative cell line, do not express detectable levels of these mRNAs. Autocrine loops involving VEGF and both VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 have been shown to promote growth as well as survival of breast cancer cell lines. Our cells do express mRNA for a NP-1 that has been proposed to facilitate metastasis and allow VEGF to act as a survival but not as a proliferation factor in other breast cancer cell lines. It is therefore possible that signaling through this receptor may be at least partially involved in the in vivo phenotypes we observe when VEGF is induced.Our study provides the first direct in vivo evidence that VEGF plays an important role in metastatic colonization of ER-positive breast cancer cells and suggests a new function of VEGF in mediating the desmoplastic response. Based on the results, we hypothesize that VEGF is involved in a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d of tumor/stromal cell interactions, in which tumor-released VEGF interacts with and recruits stromal cells, and stromal cells, in turn, provide mitogenic and angiogenic growth factors that stimulate both tumor cell and additional stromal cell growth. We anticipate that blockade of VEGF signaling may restore tamoxifen sensitivity and reduce metastatic potential. Combination of tamoxifen with an anti-VEGF signaling agent may inhibit both ER-mediated signaling and VEGF-stimulated stromal activation and angiogenesis and may be a more effective therapy for ER-positive breast cancer.

Conditioned media were collected from cell cultures of parental MCF-7, pBTE-transfected C9, C9V4, and C9V18, treated with or without 0.2 \u00b5g/mL doxycycline (Dox) for 48 h and Western blotted with a specific antibody against human VEGF (R&D Systems). The upper band of VEGF with higher molecular weight is most likely due to the posttranslational modifications. E. coli\u2013expressed human recombinant VEGF lacking posttranslational modifications was used as standard in the first two lanes. Each lane contains the equivalent VEGF secreted by ~500 cells over a 48-h period.VEGF expression increases tumor growth and vascularization. A, tumor growth in athymic nude mice. C9V4 cells (107), suspended in 200 \u00b5L of 50% phenol red\u2013free Matrigel (BD Biosciences), were inoculated into the inguinal mammary fat pad of four groups of ovariectomized athymic nude mice on day 0. A slow-release 0.72-mg E2 pellet (Innovative Research) was implanted into each mouse the day before the cell inoculation. The control group was provided with drinking water containing 2.5% sucrose only; three other groups were provided with 2.5% sucrose and 0.05 or 0.2 mg/mL of doxycycline (dox) starting the day before the cell inoculation. Doxycycline was removed from one of 0.2 mg/mL groups on day 11. There were six mice for each group (n = 6). Tumor sizes were measured twice a week. Symbols, mean tumor volume; bars, SE. B, relationship between tumor growth and VEGF levels. Cytosolic extracts were prepared from xenograft tumors as described in ref., and the amount of VEGF present was determined by ELISA (R&D Systems) and normalized to total protein concentration. The mean tumor volume at the end of the study is indicated by the red columns and the average tumor VEGF level of each mouse group (n = 6) is indicated by the green columns. C, VEGF overexpression is associated with increased tumor microvessel density. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples prepared from the animal study were sectioned and immunostained with a rat monoclonal antibody against mouse PECAM-1 (BD Biosciences). Representative images of tumor microvessels from two tumors, one with 0.2 mg/mL doxycycline induction of VEGF expression and the other without. Quantitative analysis, as shown in the histogram, was done by counting the number of PECAM-1\u2013positive blood vessels per microscopic field with five tumor samples for each condition and three microscopic fields per sample (\u00d710 magnification).Induction of VEGF expression results in tamoxifen-resistant tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastases. A, tumor growth in tamoxifen-treated mice. Four groups of E2-supplemented mice were inoculated with 107 C9V18 cells on day 0. The day before inoculation, doxycycline was supplied at 0.2 mg/mL in the drinking water for groups 3 and 4. On day 11, when the average tumor size in all groups reached ~200 mm3, the animals in groups 1 and 3 had their E2 pellet replaced with a tamoxifen pellet (5-mg 60-day release; Innovative Research). B, Ki-67 immunostaining. Paraffin-embedded tumor samples collected from tamoxifen (Tam)-treated xenograft mice were sectioned and immunostained with antibody against Ki-67 (Santa Cruz), a cell proliferation marker. The number of Ki-67\u2013positive cells per microscopic view is approximately doubled when VEGF was induced by doxycycline. Quantitative analysis, as shown in the histogram, was done by counting the number of Ki-67\u2013positive cells per microscopic field. Three microscopic fields (\u00d720 magnification) per tumor and six tumors per group were analyzed. C, macroscopic metastases. X-gal staining of the lungs (top) showed metastatic deposits of LacZ-tagged tumor cells in the tamoxifen-treated tumor-bearing mice that also received doxycycline (group 3). Top left, a mouse lung with a number of metastatic deposits. Top right, an image with higher magnification. Bottom, H&E staining of lung samples confirming the presence of metastatic lesions.Exogenous VEGF does not affect the sensitivity of C9V18 cells to estrogen or tamoxifen in vitro presumably due to the lack of VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor expression. A, in vitro cell proliferation assay. C9V18 cells were plated at a density of 104 per well in 24-well plates in 10% FBS IMEM. After 24 h, the culture media were exchanged with phenol red\u2013free IMEM containing 0.1% charcoal-stripped calf serum to remove the estrogens overnight. Then, three wells were counted on day 0, and the indicated reagents in 1% charcoal-stripped calf serum, phenol red\u2013free IMEM were added to the cultures in triplicate. The concentrations used were VEGF, 20 ng/mL; FGF-2, 20 ng/mL; 4-hydroxytamoxifen, 10\u22127 mol/L; and E2, 10\u22128 mol/L. The media were exchanged with the same conditions on day 4 and the cell numbers were counted with a Coulter counter on day 7. B, real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Expression of VEGF receptors R1, R2, and NP-1 was examined with quantitative RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. The number of cells in each culture used for mRNA isolation was determined to allow calculation of the specific number of mRNA molecules per cell. mRNAs of the receptors R1 and R2 were determined to be <1 molecule per cell in MCF-7 and C9V cells, whereas about 200 R1 mRNAs and 5,000 R2 mRNAs are expressed per cell in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).VEGF expression increased the extent of the desmoplastic response observed at both primary and metastatic sites and facilitates metastatic colonization in an experimental metastasis assay. A, cytokeratin immunostaining. Tumor samples collected from tamoxifen-treated mice were immunostained for an epithelial specific cell marker using mixed antibodies against cytokeratin (Keratin Pan Ab-1, NeoMarkers) and counterstained with hematoxylin. Because C9V tumor cells were cytokeratin positive, the cytokeratin-negative areas were considered to be the stromal-enriched compartment within the tumors. The fraction of the cytokeratin-negative stromal compartment within the total area of the microscopic view was analyzed microscopically with the aid of a counting grid and determining the stromal areas over the total areas for 5 primary tumors in each group using three sections per tumor separated by 100 \u00b5m. The results are plotted as percentage of stromal area over total counted areas. Increased desmoplasia correlated with doxycycline induction of VEGF expression. B, FGF-2 ELISA assay. Cytosolic tumor FGF-2 was determined by ELISA and normalized by protein concentration. Tumor FGF-2 levels correlated with the induction of tumor VEGF expression. C, experimental metastasis assay. C9V18 cells (0.5 \u00d7 106) were directly introduced into the blood circulation by tail vein injection. Doxycycline was provided in the drinking water at 0.2 mg/mL to one of two E2-supplemented mouse groups starting the day before cell injection. Mouse lung tissues were harvested at 2 h, 4 wk, and 10 wk after the tail vein injection. Paraffin-embedded lung samples were sectioned and immunostained with the cytokeratin antibodies to identify C9V18 cells.

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

        "content": "Suramin, a non-specific growth factor antagonist, is currently under investigation for treatment of cancer patients. We studied its action on 6 different human breast-cancer cell lines in vitro. In complete growth medium, pleiotropic effects were observed with respect to cell proliferation, i.e. suramin is stimulatory at low concentrations and inhibitory at higher concentrations, for 4 of the 6 cell lines studied. The various cell lines showed marked differences with respect to the antiproliferative action of suramin, the Evsa-T cells being by far the most sensitive ones. A suramin concentration of 100 micrograms/ml brought about a 100% stimulation of the proliferation of ZR/HERc cells, ZR 75.1 cells ectopically expressing a human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) cDNA. Although less pronounced (10 to 60% stimulation), a similar response was observed for the parent ZR 75.1 cells, as well as for T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells. The non-specificity of the action of suramin was established by the observation that suramin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation could be abolished by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and even by estradiol, both in complete growth medium and under defined serum-free conditions. Our data indicate that suramin exerts pleiotropic effects on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells in vitro, and confirm the non-specific nature of its action. The stimulatory effect of low concentrations of suramin on the proliferation of breast cancer cells may have important consequences for breast cancer patients treated with suramin.",

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

Similar to site of injury, tumors through production of paracrine and endocrine signals enrolled MSCs in their microenvironment (TME) that is seen as a \"wound that never heals\". The ability of MSCs to migrate to tumors makes them potential cargo for anticancer agents. Once reached the tumors, MSCs may exert opposite roles depending on tumor types, thus supporting cancer progression, as reported in breast, melanoma, prostate and colon carcinomas or suppressing it, as in malignant glioma. The main source of MSCs in adult is bone marrow, even if additional tissues have been identified as font. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) along with fibroblasts, pericytes, adipocytes, macrophages and immune cells play a crucial role into microenvironment of breast cancers, promoting extracellular matrix remodeling, cell migration and invasion, neo-angiogenesis, drug resistance and evasion of immunosurveillance. Once in TME, BM-MSCs can trans-differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) or vascular and perivascular cells switching from neutral role toward pro-tumorigenic behavior. Recently, we reported the ability of BM-MSCs to promote migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of osteosarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells through chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). In the last decade, different biomolecules have been found involved in BM-MSCs recruitment and activity into breast cancer including chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5); transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin 17B; CXCL10 and placental growth factor. Recently, it has been reported that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) signaling plays an important role in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. In addition, Dhawan et al. showed that platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) along with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are involved in bone marrow support in the dissemination of breast cancer cells.Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), representing ~15% of all breast cancers, are characterized by the absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and ErbB2, excluding the possibility of specific intervention for these tumors. They are biologically more aggressive and have a very poor outcome compared to other breast tumors.In this study, we investigated the role of PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSC homing and activity into the highly malignant and invasive mesenchymal-like (ML) TNBC subtype. We have recently demonstrated that cells of this subtype have a strong tendency to vasculogenic mimicry (VM) both in vitro and in vivo, and that targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 interaction by an anti-EGFR aptamer, results in inhibition of VM and tumor growth in ML TNBC.To interfere with the PDGFR\u03b2-mediated cross-talk between BM-MSCs and tumor cells, we used a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer, named Gint4.T, that we have previously characterized as high specific inhibitor of the receptor in human glioblastoma. The aptamer binds at high affinity (Kd: 9.6 nmol/l) to the extracellular domain of the PDGFR\u03b2 and impedes the ligand-dependent activation of the receptor both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it has been validated in vivo for its tumor targeting efficacy, resulting neither toxic nor immunogenic.Here we show that Gint4.T aptamer inhibits the migration of BM-MSCs towards TNBC cells and their trans-differentiation into CAFs. In addition, we used in vivo cell-tracking method to monitor instantly, noninvasively and in real time the inhibitory effect of the aptamer on BM-MSC homing to breast cancer xenografts, which ultimately results in interfering with BM-MSC-dependent pro-invasive activity. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic agent that blocks either the recruitment of BM-MSCs into TME and the tumor cell-stroma interactions thus hampering TNBC aggressiveness.Materials and MethodsCell lines and culture conditionAll human breast cancer cell lines came from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ ml penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. MCF-7 and U87MG cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were grown in RPMI 1640.For production of MDA-MB-231 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), lentiviral constructs and infection of cells were conducted as previously described. Briefly, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated on 12-well plates and infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 10% FBS and 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After 48 hours of incubation, infection efficiency was determined by analyzing GFP expression by flow cytometry.To obtain conditioned medium (CM) cells were grown in medium with 1% FBS for 48 hours. The medium was then collected, centrifuged at 1000 \u00d7 g for 10 minutes, and filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm filters (Millipore,Billerica, MA) before being used.The concentration of PDGF-BB in CM of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells was measured using the ELISA method as reported.Human BM-MSC isolation and cultureHuman BM-MSCs were provided by Dr. Lucarelli. Samples were taken from patients after obtaining informed consent according to a protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute. Isolation and culture condition of human BM-MSC was performed as previously described. BM-MSCs immunophenotypic characterization was performed by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD146 (staminal positive markers) and CD34 and CD45 (staminal negative markers). The BM-MSCs were used between passages 3-5.BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts and adipocytes has been evaluated as reported.BM-MSCs grown in the presence of MDA-MB-231 CM for 48 hours are referred as \"BM-MSCMDA-MB 231\".RNA isolation and Real time-PCRRNA isolation and Real time-PCR was performed as previously described. Briefly, total RNA from BM-MSCs was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and equal amount of total RNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II RNase H-reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green reaction mixture (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and an ABI Prism 7000 (robocycler was used for amplification Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene-specific primers used for the amplifications were as follows:PDGFR\u03b25'-AGGACACGCAGGAGGTCAT-3' (forward)5'-TTCTGCCAAAGCATGATGAC-3' (reverse)\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)5'-ACCCAGCACCATGAAGATCA-3' (forward)5'-AGAGACAGAGAGGAGCAGGA-3' (reverse)Fibroblast-specific Protein 1 (FSP-1)5'-CTCTCCTCAGCGCTTCTTCT-3' (forward)5'-GGGTCAGCAGCTCCTTTAGT-3' (reverse)Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP)5'-TACGTTTCATCACTGGCCCT-3' (forward)5'-CATCTGCTGTTCCGTGGATG-3' (reverse)\u03b2-actin5'-CAAGAGATGGCCACGGCTGCT-3' (forward)5'-TCCTTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCA-3' (reverse)Sox25'-AGAAGGATAAGTACACGCTGC -3' (forward)5'-TCCAGCCGTTCATGTGC -3' (reverse)Nanog5'-GAAATACCTCAGCCTCCAGC -3' (forward)5'-GCGTCACACCATTGCTATTC -3' (reverse)Aptamers and treatments2\u2032F-Py RNA aptamers (Gint4.T and Scrambled), developed by Camorani et al. , were synthesized by TriLink Biotechnologies and purchased from Tebu-bio srl (Magenta, Milan, Italy). Before each treatment, the aptamers were subjected to a short denaturation-renaturation step as reported.Gint4.T aptamer, PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitor: 5'-UGUCGUGGGGCAUCGAGUAAAUGCAAUUCGACA-3'. Aptamer used as a negative control and herein indicated as Scr: 5'-UUCGUACCGGGUAGGUUGGCUUGCACAUAGAACGUGUCA-3'.Cell lysate preparation and western blot analysesWhole-cell lysates and Western blots analyses were performed as previously reported. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3173, indicated as pPDGFR\u03b2), rabbit monoclonal anti-PDGFR\u03b2 (CST-3169), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (CST-9271, indicated as pAKT), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKT (CST-9272), rabbit polyclonal anti anti-phospho44/42 MAPK (CST-9101, indicated as pERK) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA); rabbit polyclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab5694, Abcam, Cambridge, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin (A4700, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO); rabbit polyclonal anti-Erk1 (sc-93) and goat polyclonal anti-vinculin (sc-7649) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of the targeted antibody was revealed by ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Densitometric analyses were performed on at least two different expositions to assure the linearity of each acquisition using ImageJ software (v1.46r). Blots shown are representative of at least three independent experiments.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and cell invasion were performed using a 24-well Boyden chambers (Corning, NY) containing inserts of polycarbonate membranes with 8 \u03bcm pores. For migration assays, all cells tested (0.3 x 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were plated into each upper chamber in the presence of different chemoattractants (lower chamber). After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, the non-migrating cells were removed from the top chamber using a cotton swab, and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the membrane insert were visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol and counted in 10 random fields/filter at 200x magnification. Results are expressed as the percentage of migrating cells considering the untreated control sample as 100%.To perform invasion assays, the top compartment of Boyden chambers was coated with 50 \u03bcl of diluted (1:3 in PBS) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After coating, chambers were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour to allow Matrigel to solidify. MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (0.5 \u00d7 105 in 100 \u03bcl serum-free medium per well) were then added to each top chamber. After incubation for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, invaded cells were visualized and analyzed as described above.Analysis of BM-MSC trans-differentiation into CAFBM-MSCs and TNBC cells were co-cultured in trans-well chambers with microporous-3\u00b5m membrane (Corning, NY). To this aim, BM-MSCs (1 x 106 cells) treated or no with Gint4.T and Scr were seeded into the lower chamber in a 6-multiwell. After incubation for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (50 x 105 cells) were added to each top chamber. After 5 days at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator in 5% CO2, total RNA was extracted from BM-MSCs and analyzed for CAF markers: \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1.NIR fluorescent BM-MSC-labelingVivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent (MW: 1173 gmol-1; A: 676 nm; Em: 696 nm) was commercially obtained from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA), dissolved in 1.3 mL of warm sterile PBS (final volume of 2.0 mL). BM-MSCs (1 x 106) were re-suspended in 200 \u00b5L of sterile PBS and incubated with VivoTrack 680 (ratio 1:1, v/v) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C under agitation in the dark. Afterwards, the suspension was washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS to remove excess cell labeling agent. At that time, VivoTrack 680-labeled cell viability was assessed microscopically by Tripan-blue exclusion (GibcoTM). To verify that the cells were successfully labelled, they were examined by flow cytometry (BD Accuri\u2122 C6), using appropriate lasers and filters for detection of 680 nm wavelength.Animal Tumor Models and treatmentAll experimental procedures complied with the European Communities Council directives (2010/63/EU) and national regulations (D.L. 116/92) and were performed in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommendations. The present study was approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization number 38/2015-01-28). MDA-MB-231 cells (10 \u00d7 106) were re-suspended in 0.1 ml of 1:1 mix of physiological saline and Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the flank of five-week-old Female Balb/c nude mice which weighed around 18-20 g (Charles River, Milan, Italy). Once tumors became palpable (established), approximately 50 mm3 [volume = 0.5 \u00d7 long diameter \u00d7 (short diameter)2], nude mice were randomized into 2 groups (3 mice for each group) for imaging studies.In order to develop a system that models the entire metastatic process, we injected MDA-MB-231/GFP cells (1\u00d7106) in presence or absence of BM-MSCs (1\u00d7106) in 150 \u00b5l of PBS Matrigel mixture (1:1, v:v) orthotopically into the mammary fat pads of severely immunocompromised NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. BM-MSCs were treated with Gint4.T (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours prior injection. Mice (3 mice for each group) were monitored for development of primary xenograft tumor with high-frequency ultrasound system (Vevo 2100 equipment; FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Sixty days post injection, mice were euthanized and tumors and organs were removed. They were either stored in 10% neutral buffered formalin for paraffin embedding/sectioning and H&E staining, or they were embedded in O.C.T. (Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound and 10 \u00b5m frozen sections were incubated with DAPI for 5 minutes to stain nuclei blue and subsequently prepared for fluorescent microscopy of GFP.In vivo tracking of BM-MSC to TNBC xenografts by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT)For FMT studies, tumor-bearing mice were maintained on a diet with a purified, alfalfa-free rodent chow for 15 days before fluorescent imaging to minimize fluorescence in the gut. VivoTrack 680 alone or BM-MSCs (1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) labeled with VivoTrack 680 and treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer (1600 pmoles) for 3 hours were administered to MDA-MB-231 xenografts by caudal vein injection. Mice under isoflurane anesthesia were analyzed at different time points by FMT 4000 imaging system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Epifluorescence (2D) and tomography (3D) datasets were both acquired and analyzed by FMT system software (TrueQuantTM v4.0) from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA). 3D regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around tumor regions, and a threshold was applied equal to 30% of the maximum value of fluorescence in the adjoining non-tumor area. The total amount (pmoles) of fluorochrome was automatically calculated relative to internal standards generated with known concentrations of the appropriate dye. After imaging studies, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and then harvested for FACS analysis of labeled BM-MSCs.Statistical analysisResults were obtained from at least three independent experiments and are expressed as the mean \u00b1SD. Statistical values were defined using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows by t-test. P value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.ResultsBM-MSCs promote TNBC cells migration and invasionTo investigate whether BM-MSCs have the ability to promote migration and invasion of ML MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells a trans-well assay was performed, in which each cancer cell line was exposed to BM-MSCs, added in the lower chamber (Figure 1A). We found that TNBC cells migrated much avidly when co-cultured with BM-MSCs for 24 hours (Figure 1B). Similarly, when TNBC cells were seeded on top compartment of trans-well coated with Matrigel a strong stimulation of their invasion was observed in the presence of BM-MSCs (Figure 1C). We also found increased expression of stem cell markers, such as Sox2 and Nanog in TNBC cells upon BM-MSCs co-culture for 5 days (Figure 1D).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits PDGFR\u03b2-mediated signaling pathway in BM-MSCsIn agreement with previous reports, we found that BM-MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 protein and mRNA (Figure 2A). Human PDGFR\u03b2-positive glioblastoma U87MG and PDGFR\u03b2-negative breast cancer MCF-7 cells were used as positive and negative control, respectively, in western blotting (left panel) and Real Time-PCR (right panel) analyses.Since several evidences show a critical role for PDGFR\u03b2 in BM-MSCs homing to tumor sites including malignant glioma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and colon carcinomas we wondered whether the Gint4.T RNA aptamer, that we previously validated as a specific inhibitor of PDGFR\u03b2, is able to interfere with this phenomenon. The aptamer binds to the extracellular domain of human PDGFR\u03b2 thus interfering with PDGF-BB ligand stimulation of the receptor. Firstly, we verified the aptamer ability to inhibit ligand-dependent PDGFR\u03b2 activation and downstream phosphatidyl-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways in BM-MSCs upon PDGF-BB stimulation (Figure 2B).It has been reported that inhibition of PDGFR\u03b2 and downstream ERK and AKT signaling inhibited human MSC osteogenesis in vitro . Accordingly, we found that the aptamer hampered BM-MSC differentiation into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes (Figure S1).The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSCs migration towards TNBC cellsNext, we determined whether the aptamer-mediated inhibition of intracellular signaling initiated by PDGFR\u03b2 results in impairment of BM-MSCs migration. As shown in Figure 3A, treating BM-MSCs with the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduced cell migration stimulated by serum, causing 44% inhibition as compared with the Scr aptamer. A similar effect was elicited by imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor acting on different tyrosine protein kinases including PDGFR\u03b2.MSCs have been recently described to home into breast carcinoma in response to numerous endocrine and paracrine signals. Importantly, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer caused a dramatic reduction of their migration toward PDGF-BB ligand as compared with controls treatment (Mock and Scr) (Figure 3B). Next, we analyzed the secretion of PDGF-BB in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 by ELISA. The data showed that PDGF-BB detected in BT-549 was 12,84 \u00b11.52 pg/ml whereas in MDA-MB-231 was 6.46 \u00b11,46 pg/ml. Accordingly, Gint4.T strongly inhibited BM-MSCs migration to both TNBC cell lines (Figure 3C).These results indicate that inhibiting PDGFR\u03b2 with Gint4.T hampers the homing of BM-MSCs to TNBC cell lines.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC trans-differentiation into Cancer Associated FibroblastsBecause CAFs are well known to play a key role in tumor progression and metastatic spread we wondered whether BM-MSCs when co-cultured with TNBC cells acquire the expression of CAF-specific markers. Interestingly, a significant increase of mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA, FAP and FSP-1 was observed when BM-MSCs were exposed up to 5 days to MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells, thus indicating that TNBC are able to induce BM-MSCs trans-differentiation into CAF-like cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, Gint4.T treatment strongly reduced CAF markers mRNA expression in BM-MSCs, co-cultured with MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4B, left) and BT-549 (Figure 4B, right) compared to Scr negative control, thus suggesting the aptamer ability to prevent BM-MSC differentiation into CAFs in TNBC microenvironment. Further, in order to assess the effect of the aptamer on the pro-invasive function of CAF-like BM-MSCs, BM-MSCs were grown for 48 hours in the presence of CM from MDA-MB-231 (BM-MSCMDA-MB 231) to induce a CAF-like phenotype (Figure 4C). Next, MDA-MB-231 cells invasiveness was assessed by using CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 as chemoattractant in the transwell invasion assay. As shown (Figure 4D), CM from BM-MSCMDA-MB-231 strongly increased the invasion rate of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to CM from na\u00efve BM-MSCs and, importantly, Gint4.T interfered with this event.These results indicate that blocking PDGFR\u03b2 on BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer not only decreased their ability to migrate towards TNBC cells but also their capability to trans-differentiate in CAFs and to induce a pro-invasive phenotype of TNBC cells.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts as assessed by Fluorescence Molecular TomographyTo follow the homing of BM-MSCs toward TNBC in vivo, we labeled the cells with VivoTrack 680 Fluorescent Cell Labeling Agent. As assessed by flow cytometry analysis, a total labeling efficiency was obtained at the experimental condition used (Figure 5A). First, we checked the absence of cell viability loss after labeling (data not shown). Then, nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts, were intravenously injected with VivoTrack 680-labeled BM-MSCs, treated with Gint4.T or the Scr aptamer, and analyzed by Fluorescence Molecular Tomography at different time-points (Figure 5B). 3D images were reconstructed and volumes of interest (VOIs) were generated around the tumor. The fluorescence signal of BM-MSCs was visualized in the tumor at 2 hours post-injection and remained visualized up to 24 hours (Figure 5C). Because VivoTrack 680 emits at NIR wavelength where autofluorescence and tissue absorbance are minimal, a low fluorescence was observed in the tissues around the tumor. As shown, the treatment of BM-MSCs with Gint4.T aptamer strongly reduced BM-MSC recruitment into MDA-MB-231 xenografts compared to the negative control (Figure 5C). Moreover, FACS analysis of NIR labeled BM-MSCs in cell suspension from tumors, revealed a significant decrease of BM-MSCs recruitment in tumors after their treatment with Gint4.T aptamer (Figure 5D), thus confirming the results of in vivo imaging. These findings prove the ability of the aptamer to inhibit tropism of BM-MSCs to TNBC targeting PDGFR\u03b2.The anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer inhibits BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivoIn agreement with previous report we found that the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells is not affected when breast cancer cells were co-injected with BM-MSCs in mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice (Figure S2). Conversely, BM-MSCs increased the metastatic potential of MDA-MB-231 cells in orthotopic model thus correlating with our in vitro findings. To investigate whether the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer has the ability to inhibit BM-MSC induced TNBC metastasis in vivo, GFP-labelled MDA-MB-231 were mixed with BM-MSCs, left untreated or prior treated with Gint4.T, and injected in mammary fat pad of mice. After 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and the lungs were extracted for analysis. Although no visible macro-metastatic lesions were observed in each experimental mouse group, GFP fluorescence was evident in the lung sections demonstrating microscopic metastasis. As shown (Figure 5E), BM-MSCs induced a significant enhancement in the number of detectable multifocal metastatic lesions that was counteracted by Gint4.T treatment.DiscussionSince the tumor microenvironment contributes to many aspects of carcinogenesis and cancer progression, the different stromal cell types, which play key roles in determining or enhancing several hallmark capabilities in different TMEs, should be taken into account to stimulate future anticancer drug development. In particular, the recent discovery that MSCs can be recruited into TME and promote cancer progression has led to consider MSCs as a suitable target for anti-cancer therapy. Importantly, tumor associated-MSCs contribute to tumor cell growth and metastatic behavior in a variety of cancers, including breast, prostate, osteosarcoma and colon cancers. The high tropism of MSCs for malignant tumors is largely similar to what observed for inflamed and injured tissues and involve the same growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. Tumor cells are able to produce a chemotactic gradient consisting of different chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12 and CXCL16, which is able to recruit MSCs.Jung et al. (2013) showed that MSCs were both recruited as well as transformed in CAFs by CXCL16 produced by prostate cancer cells. In turn, MSC-like CAFs secreted CXCL12 that binding to CXCR4 on tumor cells induced an EMT, which ultimately promoted metastasis to secondary tumor sites.Many growth factors such as PDGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), TGF-\u03b2 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been found to effectively mediate MSC homing to TME.Interestingly, several studies reported PDGF-BB as a critical mediator of MSC tropism to gliomas. It has been reported that recruitment of MSCs towards pancreatic tumors in response to PDGF, EGF and VEGF, can be inhibited by Glivec, Erbitux and Avastin, respectively. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that bFGF and downstream ERK/Smad3 signaling pathway are involved in BM-MSC tropism to 4T1 breast cancer cells by using a specific neutralizing antibody.An increasing number of evidence has shown that MSCs in primary tumors can differentiate in active components of the tumor microenvironment such as CAFs, which are known to play a key role in tumor progression, neo-angiogenesis, EMT and metastatic spread. Therefore, great interest has been shown in developing therapeutic targeting strategies aimed to inhibit MCS support thus improving therapeutic efficacy in treating cancer. Thus, in this scenario, the starting point for MSC targeted therapy is the identification of specific molecular pathways involved in pro-tumorigenic cross-talk between MSCs and cancer cells. The delineation of key molecular pathways that underlie this important interplay has improved the knowledge of the biology of TME, tumor spreading, and carcinogenesis. Over past years, several studies have shown that MSCs express high levels of PDGFR\u03b2 suggesting that it could play a crucial role in processes in which MSCs are involved. In fact, it is widely reported that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in specifying MSC commitment to mesenchymal lineages as well as in MSC proliferation and self-renewal. Furthermore, PDGFR\u03b2 signaling has emerged as a predominant pathway in recruitment of MSCs towards tumor sites. Hata et al. , for example, have demonstrated that PDGFR\u03b2 is involved in MSC tropism for malignant gliomas, providing direct evidence that tumor is capable of attracting MSCs in an intracranial glioma model through PDGFR\u03b2 pathway. Furthermore, it has been reported that PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC recruitment into TME, contributed to enhance the aggressive and invasive properties of many other tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colon carcinomas. However, although PDGFR\u03b2 inhibitors have already been tested for their capability to target and interfere with receptor activity in MSCs, no studies have still demonstrated the possibility to target PDGFR\u03b2 to prevent pro-tumorigenic effect of MSCs into tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the current class of PDGFR\u03b2 drugs consists of small molecule TKIs that show limited specificity and modest efficacy whereas no antibodies have entered the clinic. This study reports, for the first time, an innovative therapeutic tool, an anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer able to prevent BM-MSC recruitment and activity into TNBC microenvironment. Recent evidences have widely shown that BM-MSCs can integrate into the tumor-associated stroma and promote the progression of TNBC through the activation of different mechanisms involving HIFs, TGF-\u03b2 and CCL5. Up to now, no work has demonstrated the involvement of PDGFR\u03b2 pathway in MSC homing toward TNBC microenvironment, as well as MSC-mediated TNBC progression. Interestingly, in this study we show that the anti-PDGFR\u03b2 aptamer strongly reduces both in vitro BM-MSC migration stimulated by two different TNBC cell lines and in vivo BM-MSC recruitment into TNBC xenografts, as assessed by FMT. These results underline the importance of PDGFR\u03b2 in mediating MSC migration towards TNBC site and highlights Gint4.T aptamer to specifically prevent PDGFR\u03b2-mediated MSC tropism for TME. Finally, recent evidence has demonstrated that MSCs selectively proliferate in TME and trans-differentiate in pro-tumor supporting CAFs. Although the effect of MSCs on growth of breast cancer is controversial and probably depends on the experimental setting of the animal model, conversely, it is well established that MSCs have a significant impact on promoting breast cancer metastasis. Our data demonstrated that Gint4.T aptamer not only hampers PDGFR\u03b2 downstream signaling in BM-MSCs, but it also interferes with their recruitment into TNBC and with their differentiation into CAF thus preventing metastatic lung lesions (Figure 6).ConclusionsTumor microenvironment recruits MSCs from the circulation, adjacent tissues and bone-marrow thus educating these cells to adopt pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. MSCs in tumor cause a formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and can also enhance the proportions of cancer stem cells, promote EMT, and stimulate tumor angiogenesis. These effects contribute to tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Our aptamer-based approach to interrupt the cross-talk between cancer cells, MSCs and the inflammatory tumor microenvironment will likely provide new anti-cancer opportunities.Abbreviations\u03b1-SMA\u03b1-smooth muscle actinbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorBM-MSCsbone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cellsCAFcarcinoma-associated fibroblastCCL5chemokine C-C motif ligand 5CLLchronic lymphocytic leukemiaCXCL10C-X-C motif chemokine 10CXCR4chemokine receptor type 4DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumEMTepithelial-mesenchymal transitionERK 1/2extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2FAPfibroblast activation proteinFBSfetal bovine serumFMTFluorescence Molecular TomographyFSP-1Fibroblast-specific Protein 1MLmesenchymal-likeMSCsmesenchymal stem cellsPDGF-BBplatelet-derived growth factor BBPDGFR\u03b2platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2PI3Kphosphatidyl-3-kinaseROIsregions of interestTAMstumor-associated macrophagesTMEtumor microenvironmentTNBCtriple-negative breast cancerTGF-\u03b2transforming growth factor \u03b2VOIsvolumes of interestSupplementary MaterialInteraction of MSC with tumor cellsMesenchymal stem cells within tumour stroma promote breast cancer metastasisBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and the tumor microenvironmentMesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.

        "content": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P &lt; 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.",

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

F Biodistribution of the DID-labeled liposomes in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at different time points after intravenous injection. G Ex vivo imaging of dissected tumors 24\u00a0h after injection of C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD, respectively. H Semi-quantitative ROI values of mean fluorescence intensity at tumor sites. **p\u2009<\u20090.01; Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of three technical replicates; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01C, D, the glycosyls of Rg3 at the C3-position were oriented towards the water molecules and sticked out of the surface of the liposomal membrane, which could potentially interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation. A Concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1-cultured medium (CM) after the treatment of PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

H Flow cytometry analysis of activated CAFs in tumor after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively. (n\u2009=\u20093) *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAs cancer cell-derived TGF-\u03b2 is a prominent CAFs-inducer, TGF-\u03b2 secretion in 4T1 conditioned medium (CM) was measured by ELISA assay after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Scale bar: 2\u00a0mm. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Unpaired t-test was used for analysis of differences between two groups. Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

All animals were treated according to the Guide for the Care and Laboratory Animals and all experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Fudan University (certificate number: 2020-04-YJ-WJX-01).Preparation and characterization of liposomesThe formulation in which PL-100\u00a0M/ Rg3 (or cholesterol)/docetaxel dissolved at the weight ratio of 10:3:1 in the organic solution (chloroform: ethanol 1:1) was prepared. The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484). Then, a larger mixed bilayer system consisting of 300 DSPC and 90 Rg3 molecules was generated with memgen tool. a total of 300\u00a0ns simulation was conducted for the system. The CHARMM36 force field was applied through MD simulations,. NPT ensemble was applied for the simulation with the Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat to keep the temperature at 300\u00a0K and the Parrinello\u2013Rhaman method to maintain a constant pressure of 1\u00a0atm. LINCS algorithm was applied for the constraint of H-bonds lengths. Partical-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was utilized to calculate the long-rang electrostatic interactions with PME grid of 0.12\u00a0nm in the reciprocal-apace interactions and cubic interpolation. The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score. The optimal docking conformation was determined based on the docking score and hydrogen bonding interactions. PyMol was utilized to generate the ribbon/surface view of docked complexes.Intracellular uptake assay of the liposomes by 4T1 cells2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well. In Rg3-Lp/C6\u2009+\u2009glucose, Rg3-Lp/C6\u2009+\u2009WZB117 groups, the medium was aspired after 12\u00a0h. 20\u00a0mM glucose solution and 10\u00a0\u03bcM WZB117 was added and incubated with cells for 1\u00a0h, respectively. The cells were then treated with C-Lp loaded with C6 (C-Lp/C6) and Rg3-Lp loaded with C6 (Rg3-Lp/C6) respectively (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL) for 4\u00a0h. The cells were then collected, washed three times with pre-chilled PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Intracellular uptake of liposomes by Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cellsGlut 1 siRNA (5\u2019- CCAACUGGACCUCAAACUUTT -3\u2019) and siRNA mate were mixed in opti-MEM medium to form siRNA complexes. Then siRNA complex was added in cell culture medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 72\u00a0h. Then, C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 was added in the medium respectively for 4\u00a0h (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL). The cells were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). For confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) observation, the cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained and imaged as described previously.In vitro cytotoxicity studiesThe cytotoxicity of free DTX and different DTX formulations against 4T1 cells was examined with MTT cytotoxicity assay. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 4T1 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. After 12\u00a0h, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, mixture of Rg3 and DTX (Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX within a certain DTX concentration range was added in the medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 48\u00a0h, respectively. 50 \u03bcL of MTT (2\u00a0mg/mL) was then added and incubated for another 4\u00a0h. Then, the medium was aspirated and 200 \u03bcL DMSO was added. After shaking for 30\u00a0min, the optical density (OD) value of each well was measured at 490\u00a0nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Trading Co., Ltd., Switzerland). The cell viability rate was calculated according to the following formula:Control: Untreated cells (viability rate 100%); Blank: (the wells with no cells).Cell apoptosis assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well. DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX was added in the medium and incubated with 4T1 cells, respectively (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Then the cells were collected and washed with PBS. Next, the cells were further stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. The apoptosis rate of the cells was then analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).At the same time, the 4T1 cells suspension (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105/ mL) was inoculated into 12-well plate with prepared cell sheets (0.1\u00a0ml cell suspension every cell sheet). The drug solution was changed according to the group described before after 24\u00a0h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33,342 and PI after 48\u00a0h of induction, then mounted with glycerol jelly mounting medium and exposed to inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) for qualitative observation and photo taking.Culture and polarization induction of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM)Bone marrow cells were collected from 6\u20138-week old specific pathogen-free male Balb/c mice as described above. Bone marrow cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 20\u00a0ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 96\u00a0h to induce bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) differentiation. Interferon-\u03b3 (20\u00a0ng/mL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500\u00a0ng/mL) were added to the medium for 24\u00a0h to induce the polarization toward M1 phenotype.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-cultured medium after different treatment was then collected. Then, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated for 24\u00a0h with 4T1-CM plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor or with different 4T1 cultured medium collected from 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX). 3T3 cultured medium collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with PBS (3T3-CM), 4T1-CM (3T3-CM @ 4T1-CM), 4T1-CM/SB-431542 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM/SB-431542)), 4T1-CM@DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@DTX)), 4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX)), 4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM)), 4T1-CM@Rg3 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3)), 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), 4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX)) or 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX)) were collected.

Sterilize under high pressure for 30\u00a0min. After sterilization, the agarose solution was added to a 96-well plate with 50 \u03bcL per well. The 4T1 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were then digested, mixed and added to a 96-well cell culture plate containing agarose gel at 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL and 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 cells/100 \u03bcL per well respectively. It was placed in a 37\u00b0 C incubator for cultivation. The fluid was changed every other day, and the tumor sphere grew to about 500\u00a0\u03bcm after 10\u00a0days. C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 were then administered, respectively. After incubating for 12\u00a0h, the tumor spheres were washed three times with PBS buffered saline solution, then transferred to a small dish, fluorescence of C6 was observed with CLSM (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) from the top layer of the tumor sphere to the bottom layer, a tomographic scan is performed every 10\u00a0\u03bcm. After the scanning, the penetration depth of the nanoparticles is analyzed and counted by the ZEN software provided by the instrument.Immunofluorescence staining of \u03b1-SMA1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX concentration, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), respectively. 4T1-conditioned medium after different treatment was obtained for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA assay) after 24\u00a0h. The 3T3 cells after different treatment were then IF stained and imaged with primary anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam) and Cy3-labeled fluorescent secondary antibody (33108ES60, Yeasen) according to the procedure as described before.In vivo imaging of tumor bearing mice5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were orthotopically injected into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of Balb/c female mice to develop the orthotopic TNBC model. Treatment was initiated at about 7\u00a0days after inoculation. The tumor bearing mice were divided randomly into two groups and were injected intravenously with C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD respectively. In vivo fluorescent images were taken under in vivo imaging system (IVIS) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24\u00a0h after injection. After 24\u00a0h, the mice were killed. Tumors, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys were then collected and imaged under IVIS system.In vivo antitumor efficacyOrthotopic TNBC model was developed by injecting 4T1 cells into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of BALB/c female mice. After 7\u00a0days, the mice were divided randomly into 8 groups (n\u2009=\u20096 per group) and each treated group was injected intravenously with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX (10\u00a0mg/kg of DTX) every 4\u00a0days for 20\u00a0days respectively. The length and width of tumors and the body weight were measured simultaneously. The tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following formula:Length (L) is the longest diameter and width (W) is the shortest diameter perpendicular to length. At Day 20, all mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were harvested for photo imaging and histological examination. For the histological analysis of apoptosis cells and CAFs in tumor tissue, the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and \u03b1-SMA staining of tumor slices was performed and full-scanned, In addition, for the histological analysis of the collagen in tumor tissue, MASSON staining was conducted and five randomly chosen microscopic fields were selected and semi-quantified by ImageJ software.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-CM after different treatment was then collected. The concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in the different medium was detected with ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction. The results were read using a microplate spectrophotometer at 450\u00a0nm (Thermo Multiskan MK3, USA). Tumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy and homogenized with pre-cooled PBS (5\u00a0ml PBS/1\u00a0g tumor). The prepared homogenate was centrifuged at 5000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min and the TGF-\u03b2 concentration in the supernatant was detected with the ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction.Western Blot (WB) assay3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The protein of the cells was then harvested according to the procedures described previously. 50\u00a0mg of protein per lane were loaded on the polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
