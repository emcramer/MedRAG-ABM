    "I cannot provide rules for the signal \"Tnn\" in the context of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) because the provided documents do not contain information about this specific signal. The documents focus on various aspects of CAFs and their interactions with other cells in the tumor microenvironment, but they do not mention \"Tnn\" as a signal or factor. To generate rules for \"Tnn\" in CAFs, I would need additional information about this signal, such as: * **What is \"Tnn\"?** Is it a specific protein, a cytokine, a growth factor, or another type of molecule? * **What is its known function?** How does \"Tnn\" affect cells, particularly CAFs? * **What research papers or studies provide evidence for its role in CAFs?** Once I have this information, I can generate potential rules for \"Tnn\" in CAFs, following the format you provided, and with justifications based on the available research.
