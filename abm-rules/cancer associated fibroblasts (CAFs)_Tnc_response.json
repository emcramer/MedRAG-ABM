    "## Potential Rules for Tenascin-C (Tnc) in Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Tnc increases migration speed. **Justification:** Tenascin-C (Tnc) is a complex multifunctional protein that has been shown to promote cell migration [Document 14]. This rule reflects the known ability of Tnc to enhance cell motility, which is a key characteristic of CAFs. **Rule 2:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Tnc increases transform to activated. **Justification:** Tnc is frequently up-regulated in the matrix around solid tumors [Document 14]. This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can become activated upon encountering cancer cells, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. **Rule 3:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Tnc increases MMP-13 secretion. **Justification:** Tnc has been shown to regulate MMP gene expression [Document 14]. This rule reflects the observation that Tnc up-regulates expression of MMP-13, which is a key enzyme involved in ECM remodeling and tumor invasion. **Rule 4:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Tnc increases TIMP-3 secretion. **Justification:** Tnc has been shown to regulate MMP gene expression [Document 14]. This rule reflects the observation that Tnc up-regulates expression of TIMP-3, which is a tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases and can modulate MMP activity. **Rule 5:** In cancer associated fibroblasts, Tnc increases transform to epithelial. **Justification:** Tnc is a complex ECM protein that frequently is up-regulated in the matrix around solid tumors [Document 14]. This rule reflects the observation that CAFs can revert to a less activated state, potentially due to the influence of the tumor microenvironment or other factors. This less activated state can promote tumor dormancy and reduce metastasis. **Note:** These rules are based on the provided documents and are intended to be a starting point for your agent-based model. You may need to adjust these rules based on your specific model and the specific type of triple-negative breast cancer you are modeling. "
