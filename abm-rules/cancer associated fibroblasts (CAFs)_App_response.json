    "## Potential Rules for CAFs and App: **Unfortunately, the provided documents do not contain information about the interaction of CAFs with App.** App is not mentioned in any of the provided research papers. Therefore, I cannot generate any rules for CAFs and App based on the provided documents. **To generate rules for CAFs and App, you would need to find research papers that specifically investigate the interaction between these two.** **Here are some general considerations for designing rules for CAFs and App:** * **App's function:** First, you need to understand the function of App in the context of triple-negative breast cancer. Is it a growth factor, a cytokine, or a signaling molecule? What are its known targets and pathways? * **CAF response to App:** Once you understand App's function, you can investigate how CAFs respond to it. Do they upregulate or downregulate specific behaviors in response to App? * **Contextual factors:** Consider the context in which App and CAFs interact. For example, are there specific conditions (e.g., hypoxia, inflammation) that influence their interaction? **Example of a potential rule:** \"In cancer-associated fibroblasts, App increases migration speed.\" **Justification:** This rule could be justified if research shows that App acts as a chemoattractant for CAFs, promoting their migration towards the tumor cells. **Remember to always base your rules on solid scientific evidence from relevant research papers.** "
