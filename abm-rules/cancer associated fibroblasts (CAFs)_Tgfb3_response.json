(Document [59]) **Rule 64:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of fibroblasts present in the tumor model. (Document [60]) **Rule 65:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory factor from 0 towards 10 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by CAFs. This can lead to increased inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, which can promote tumor growth and invasion. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific types and levels of TGF-\u03b2 present in the tumor model. (Document [61]) **Rule 66:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 decreases secretion of anti-inflammatory factor from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can suppress the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors by CAFs. This can lead to a decrease in the immune response and promote tumor growth. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific types and levels of TGF-\u03b2 present in the tumor model. (Document [62]) **Rule 67:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 increases migration speed from 1 towards 2 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the migration of CAFs. This can lead to increased invasion and metastasis of the tumor. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific types and levels of TGF-\u03b2 present in the tumor model. (Document [63]) **Rule 68:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 increases cycle entry from 7.2e-05 towards 0.00036 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.25 and Hill power 2. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the proliferation of CAFs. This can lead to increased tumor growth and invasion. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific types and levels of TGF-\u03b2 present in the tumor model. (Document [64]) **Rule 69:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 increases transform to activated from 0 towards 0.01 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.01 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the activation of CAFs, potentially due to the release of factors or the interaction with the tumor microenvironment. This activated state can promote the growth and invasion of the tumor. This rule can be adjusted based on the specific density and type of fibroblasts present in the tumor model. (Document [65]) **Rule 70:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Tgfb3 increases secretion of pro-inflammatory factor from 0 towards 10 with a Hill response, with half-max 5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** This rule reflects the observation that TGF-\u03b2 can promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by CAFs. This can lead to increased inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, which can promote tumor growth and"
