Taken together, these data provide new insights into the role of miR-9 as an important player in the cross-talk between cancer cells and stroma.Tumorigenesis is not considered anymore a tumor cell-autonomous mechanism triggered by accumulation of somatic aberrations, but fostered by a two-way interaction between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment.Cancer cells are indeed integrated in a biologically complex stroma, composed of different cell types (such as immune system components, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and adipocytes) as well as extracellular matrix (ECM), which originates the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). It is known that a permissive TME has a key role in tumorigenesis.Fibroblasts, which represent the majority of the stromal cells, are very active in the ECM synthesis, regulation of inflammation and wound healing. Even though the communication between cancer cells and fibroblasts has been extensively described, it is still currently unclear how this interaction promotes the activation of quiescent fibroblasts in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). It has been reported that breast carcinoma-associated stroma differs from its paired normal in deregulated expression of cytokines, ECM molecules and metalloproteinases.Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Clinically, this heterogeneous disease is categorized into four major molecular subtypes: luminal-A, luminal-B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing and triple-negative/basal-like. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) constitutes approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer cases, with the worst outcome of all subtypes.In breast cancer, the biological characteristics and genetic heterogeneity between CAFs and their paired normal fibroblasts (NFs) have been described. Breast CAFs are characterized by stronger ability in proliferation and cell motility in comparison with NFs and, consistently with this biological behavior, gene expression profiling showed the abnormal regulation of key signaling pathways as cell adhesion and secreting factors in CAFs.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play an important role in various biological processes. Their extracellular presence as the major RNA component of exosomes suggests an internalization process by TME cells, thus mediating the cancer\u2013host communication and participating in cancer metastasis by adapting the cell niches. To date, little is known about miRNA expression differences between CAFs and NFs. Array data of primary cultures of CAFs versus their paired NFs from resected breast tumor tissues identified 11 dysregulated miRNAs, and their predicted target genes resulted mainly related to adhesion, migration, secretion and cell\u2013cell interaction. A set of three miRNAs has been described to be involved in reprogramming NFs to CAFs in ovarian cancer and, very recently, miR-200s were found to contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodeling.In the present work, our attention focused on miR-9 as a possible player in the cross-talk between breast cancer cells and stroma. Numerous evidence supports this hypothesis: miR-9 has been described as metastamiR in breast cancer and it resulted markedly upregulated in breast cancer cells compared with normal mammary tissues. MiR-9 directly targets E-cadherin (CDH1) leading to increase cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Even more interestingly, miR-9 was found to be secreted by different human tumor cell lines, packaged into microvesicles and directly delivered to endothelial cells where it is able to promote migration and neovascularization activating JACK\u2013STAT pathway. These observations suggest that tumor-secreted miRNAs can be involved in intercellular communication. Moreover, recent data showed that miR-9 overexpression is associated with epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and poor prognosis in breast cancer, leading to its possible use as a biomarker for cancer progression and a target for treatment.Our data revealed a higher expression of miR-9 in primary triple-negative breast CAFs versus NFs isolated from patients. Cell motility assays of immortalized NFs overexpressing miR-9 and CAFs where the miRNA was inhibited showed miR-9's ability to affect the fibroblast behavior. Furthermore, tumor-secreted miR-9 can be transferred via exosomes to recipient NFs and this uptake resulted in enhanced cell motility. Gene expression profiles allowed us to identify a subgroup of molecules differentially expressed in NFs overexpressing miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) mainly involved in cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling. Moreover, miR-9-mediated downmodulation of its known target CDH1 in breast cancer cells cultured in conditioned medium from NFs/miR-9 indicated that miR-9 is also released by fibroblasts and transferred to tumor cells, and provided details regarding the biological mechanisms that could explain both the stronger motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells observed in vitro, and the improved in vivo growth following co-injection with NFs/miR-9.ResultsMiR-9 is overexpressed in triple-negative breast CAFs compared with NFs and contributes to acquisition of NFs to a CAF phenotypeTo investigate whether a different expression of miR-9 could play a role in the acquisition of normal fibroblasts to a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, the level of mature miR-9 was first evaluated in couples of primary NFs/CAFs isolated from patients with different breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2 and triple negative). Interestingly, qRT-PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher level of miR-9 only in triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart (Figure 1). To study the functional role of miR-9, we decided to use immortalized NFs and CAFs. To verify the purity of the fibroblasts, we tested by western blot analysis the expression of the well-recognized marker \u03b1SMA, which, as expected, showed expression at a higher level in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S1). Since it was demonstrated that breast CAFs are characterized by stronger cell motility than their paired NFs, we performed migration, via transwell or wound healing (Figure 2a), and invasion assays (Figure 2b) of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control (NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control). The overexpression of the miRNA promoted fibroblast motility. Then, in order to clarify if the modulation of miR-9 also affects CAF properties, the reverse experiment was performed inhibiting miRNA with LNA-9. The transient transfection of CAFs with the inhibitor reduced their migration and invasion compared with control (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that miR-9 is involved in the acquisition of a CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.Tumor-secreted miR-9 is transferred to NFs via exosomes and increases cell motilityIn order to elucidate if tumor-secreted miR-9 is delivered to the cellular components of the stroma via exosomes, first TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-9 or control, then the conditioned medium, changed 8\u2009h post-transfection, was collected from transfected cells at 48\u2009h and processed for exosomal purification. MiR-9 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in transfected cells (Figure 3a) and in the isolated exosomes (Figure 3b) to verify the transfection efficiency and the levels of the miRNA released, respectively. The biochemical characterization of the isolated exosomes revealed the purity of the samples (Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 3c, the incubation with tumor-secreted exosomes resulted in increase of miR-9 level in recipient NFs compared to control, thus indicating that the recipient NFs can indeed uptake the exosomes and their cargo. Similar results were obtained with the MDA-MB-468 cell line (Supplementary Figures S3A\u2013C). The biological effect of the exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9 was investigated performing migration and invasion assays on recipient NFs. The internalization of this miRNA resulted in stronger cell motility (Figure 3d). To confirm that the miR-9 internalized by NFs was specifically delivered from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells, we repeated the experiment in exosome-deprived medium. No significant difference was detected in miR-9 transfer to recipient NFs (Supplementary Figures S4A\u2013C). Furthermore, to exclude the presence of micelles, we repeated the same approach introducing an additional \u2018medium change step' 24\u2009h post-transfection. The conditioned \u2018post-change' medium (pcm) was then collected after additional 24\u2009h and exosomes were isolated. The additional \u2018medium change step' did not affect miR-9 expression in recipient NFs, and led to a similar motility improvement in the presence of miR-9 containing exosomes (Supplementary Figures S4D and E).NFs overexpressing miR-9 stimulate tumor cell migration by reducing E-cadherinSince we demonstrated that miR-9 is delivered from breast cancer cells to the microenvironment promoting the neoplastic progression, and considering that the tumor\u2013stroma cross-talk is a two-way communication, we also investigated if the miRNA could be released by fibroblasts to tumor cells. For this reason, co-culture experiments of TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines in conditioned medium derived from NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control were performed. The migration ability of cancer cells was assessed and, as shown in Figure 4a, miR-9 internalization resulted in stronger motility. MiR-9 uptake in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 was evaluated by qRT-PCR as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Since it has been reported that co-culture with CAFs induces in tumor cells downregulation of E-cadherin, known miR-9 direct target, we therefore hypothesized that the increase in tumor cell motility induced by miR-9 internalization could be explained, at least in MDA-MB-468 cell line, by modulation of this molecule. Indeed, we detected by western blot analysis the downmodulation of E-cadherin protein in MDA-MB-468 grown in contact with the supernatant from NFs overexpressing miR-9 (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we also observed that the miR-9 released by NFs/miR-9 induced recipient NFs themselves to enhance migration and invasion (Figure 4c), thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Taken together, these results demonstrated that miR-9 can be delivered from microenvironment to neoplastic cells, where it is able to enhance tumor progression.Identification of differentially expressed genes in NFs upon miR-9 transfectionTo clarify the molecular alterations triggered by miR-9 to induce the acquisition of breast NFs to a CAF phenotype, gene expression profile of NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 or control was performed. We identified 11 downregulated and 20 upregulated genes in NFs overexpressing miR-9 compared with NFs/control based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05 (Figure 5a). We selected 17 genes (8 downregulated and 9 upregulated) related with cell motility pathways and ECM remodeling to be validated by qRT-PCR in NFs/control versus NFs/miR-9 (Figure 5b). Downregulated genes encode for proteins mainly involved in ECM organization, whereas upmodulated molecules are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and response to extracellular stimuli (Figure 5c). EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1, collagen type 1 alpha 1, sprouty homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-1, retinal cadherin, phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (EFEMP1, COL1A1, SPRY2, MMP1, CDH4 and PMAIP1, respectively) showed significant differential expression, consistently with the microarray analysis.To assess whether the deregulation of our selected genes was detectable in human clinical specimens, we analyzed public gene expression data of epithelial and stromal cells from breast cancer patients compared with their normal counterparts. We decided to test the expression status of EFEMP1, COL1A1 and MMP1, assuming their relevance in the pathways of our interest. In data set GSE10797 (Figure 5d), we observed significant downregulation of EFEMP1 and upregulation of MMP1 in stromal cells of 28 breast cancer patients compared with stromal cells from 5 normal individuals who received reduction mammoplastic surgery. These results were consistent with the modulation observed in gene expression data of NFs transfected with miR-9 compared with control. On the contrary, COL1A1 displayed an opposite behavior if compared with our gene profiling results. Moreover, the same gene expression patterns were observed in the epithelial cells from the same patients, suggesting that these genes play their role in both cell types (Supplementary Figure S6). In a second gene expression data set of 7 breast tumor and 15 normal stroma samples (GSE8977; Figure 5d), we observed the same differential expression for EFEMP1 and MMP1. Again, COL1A1 resulted differentially expressed but with an opposite behavior in comparison with in vitro data. Taken together, these results show that some of the transcriptional alterations identified in NFs after transient transfection with miR-9 are also detected in stroma of breast cancer patients.NFs overexpressing miR-9 promote in vivo tumor growthSeveral studies revealed that the conversion of NFs into CAFs may occur at the initiation phase of breast cancer, inducing malignant transformation of adjacent mammary epithelial cells. Our results show that the exosome-vehicolated-miR-9 released from transfected fibroblasts promoted tumor cell aggressiveness in vitro, modulating genes involved in cell motility and ECM remodeling. To confirm the capability of miR-9 overexpressing NFs to affect cancer progression, we monitored in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected with NFs/miR-9 or control in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice (6 mice for group). Moreover, a control group of six mice was injected with parental MDA-MB-468 cells to evaluate tumor development and progression. We measured tumor volumes for 2 weeks and, as shown in Figure 6, tumor growth was significantly increased in mice co-injected with MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs transiently transfected with miR-9 compared with the control group. In conclusion, these data confirm that a higher expression of miR-9 in the TME plays an important role in breast cancer progression.DiscussionIt is well supported that miRNAs are involved in the progression of cancer, acting as tumor suppressors as well as oncogenes depending on the target molecules; however, their activity in the tumor stroma needs to be further investigated. Emerging reports of miRNA abilities in reprogramming normal into cancer-associated fibroblasts have been described. MiRNA microarrays of CAFs and NFs in breast cancer identified a small group of differentially expressed miRNAs, including miR-200\u2009s, which have been recently demonstrated to be direct mediators of NFs reprogramming into CAFs and ECM remodeling.In the present work, we show that miR-9 acts as an important player in the communication between breast cancer cells and the cellular component of the TME and it is able to promote the conversion of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype.Zhao and colleagues did not report miR-9 as deregulated in breast CAF/NF couples obtained from patients; however, we observed a significantly higher level of this miRNA in primary triple-negative CAFs compared with the normal counterpart. This first evidence is consistent with the association of miR-9 with aggressive breast cancer phenotype and with our own data (unpublished).In line with the genetic heterogeneity between breast CAFs and NFs, our expression profile identified in NFs overexpressing miR-9 a signature of differentially expressed genes correlated with cell motility and ECM organization: specifically members of matrix metalloproteinases, fibulins and collagens. MMPs are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving the ECM components, growth factors, cytokines, cell surface-associated adhesion and signaling receptors. In particular, we observed the up-modulation of MMP1, which is reported to be highly expressed in poor-outcome breast carcinomas and associated with breast tumor progression. Downmodulation of EFEMP1, a member of fibulin family, secreted proteins associated with the ECM scaffold and regulators of cell proliferation and migration, which is consistent with the reduction observed in a cohort of sporadic breast cancer and the recently demonstrated decrease during breast tumor progression. Intriguingly, we also detected the downregulation of COL1A1, the major structural component of ECM which drives the fundamental physiological processes that allow to adapt the microenvironment to changing functional demands, and which is reported as a direct target of MMP1 activity. The degradation of type I collagen by MMP1 was indeed shown to be associated with rapid progression, poor overall survival and secondary metastasis, and it appears that this process may have a pivotal role in the acquisition of invasive characteristics in breast cancer. Whereas the in silico analysis of EFEMP1 and MMP1 expression in human series confirmed that the same modulations are also detected in stromal component of breast cancer patients, COL1A1 showed an opposite behavior. This discordance could be explained by the heterogeneity of stromal tissue, which contains immune and endothelial cells beside fibroblasts and by the different breast cancer subtypes of patients analyzed.Our data demonstrated that the modulation of gene expression profile and the acquisition of a CAF-like phenotype in recipient fibroblasts can be induced by tumor cells through exosome-mediated delivery of miR-9. This is not surprising, since circulating miRNAs seem to be mainly associated to exosomes, and exchanged between different cell types as a communication tool. Moreover, tumor-secreted miR-9 has been demonstrated to affect also endothelial cell proliferation, thus suggesting that this miRNA is probably exploited by tumor cells as a sort of \u2018signal' to convert the microenvironment into a pro-tumoral niche.Even more interestingly, we demonstrated the existence of a positive circuitry, where \u2018converted' fibroblasts are in turn able to promote tumor growth and aggressiveness: our results revealed that conditioned medium derived from NFs overexpressing miR-9 increased the aggressiveness of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, consistent with the well-established role of CAFs in promoting cancer cell progression. We demonstrated that this stronger cell capability could be caused, at least in MDA-MB-468, by the reduction of the E-cadherin, calcium-dependent cell\u2013cell adhesion glycoprotein that has been demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-9. In MDA-MB-231, where E-cadherin is epigenetically silenced, other molecules are probably regulated by miR-9 in order to obtain the observed biological effect.Multiple studies focused on the cancer invasion- and progression-promoting role of breast CAFs. In contrast to NFs, mammary CAFs induce local invasion of primary tumor cells trough epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition and ECM remodeling and co-implantation tumor xenograft models demonstrated that CAFs from human breast cancer significantly induce tumor growth than NFs from the same patients. Even though the mechanisms by which NFs are converted into CAFs are still unclear, here we show that the overexpression of miR-9 in normal fibroblasts was sufficient to increase tumor growth in mouse models, corroborating the capability of this miRNA to reprogram NFs into CAFs, thus promoting tumor initiation and progression.In conclusion, the involvement of miR-9 in reprogramming the microenvironment, activating tumor-promoting abilities in normal fibroblasts, as migration and invasion, in addition to its tumor-intrinsic pro-metastatic role, confers to this miRNA a relevant potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.Materials and MethodsIsolation of primary fibroblasts and cell culturePrimary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimens belonging to patients who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. Surgically resected tumor and normal tissues were sampled by pathologists immediately after surgery and then enzymatically digested with Collagenase/Hyaluronidase (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) overnight at 37\u2009\u00b0C in agitation. After filtration through a 100-\u03bcm pore filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), cells were plated using fibroblast growth in FGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Immortalized NFs and CAFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium. TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1610-medium (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MDA-MB-468 cell line was cultured in DMEM (Euroclone) with 10% FBS. Breast cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). All cells were maintained at 37\u2009\u00b0C under 5% CO2.RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reactions by using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or TaqManMicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qRT-PCR with Fast SYBRGreen Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate the expression of the genes and GAPDH as an internal control. All the primer sequences are reported in Table 1. MicroRNA expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR performed with TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mir-21 or RNU44 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as an internal control. qRT-PCR assays were performed in StepONEPlus Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the relative expression was calculated using the comparative 2\u2212\u0394Ct method.Mimics and inhibitorsMiR-9 precursor and negative control were purchased as Pre-miR precursor molecules (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) against miR-9 and the corresponding control were purchased from EXIQON (Vedbaek, Denmark). Briefly, fibroblasts and breast cancer cells were transfected for 24 or 48\u2009h, respectively, with 25\u2009nM miRNA precursor or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Preparation of conditioned medium and exosome extractionThe media from breast cancer cells and fibroblasts were collected and centrifuged at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 10\u2009min and the supernatants resulted as conditioned media. Cancer-secreted exosomes were extracted using the ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TCExosome Precipitation Solution was added to the breast cancer conditioned medium and refrigerated overnight. The sample was first centrifuged at 1500\u2009r.p.m. for 30\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C and then at 3000\u2009r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. The exosome pellet was resuspended in 250\u2013500\u2009\u03bcl of appropriate cell medium and incubated 72\u2009h with recipient cells. Exosome-deprivated medium was obtained upon 25 000\u2009r.p.m. ultracentrifugation for 90\u2009min.Migration, wound healing and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion were performed in Transwell Permeable Support 8.0\u2009\u03bcm (Corning, Kennebunk, ME, USA). Briefly, 1.5 \u00d7 105 cells in 300\u2009\u03bcl of serum-free medium were seeded in the top of the chamber, for invasion experiments in the presence of Matrigel (Corning). Medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 6, 12 or 24\u2009h of incubation at 37\u2009\u00b0C the migrating/invading cells on the opposite side of the filter were fixed with cold ethanol and stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK), then counted with the Image-Pro Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For wound-healing assays, 3.0 \u00d7 105 fibroblasts were seeded in six-well plates. An artificial gap was created on the confluent cell monolayer with a plastic tip and the images of the wound area were captured in the following 24\u2009h.Protein extraction and western blot analysisWhole-cell lysates and total exosomal proteins were prepared using RIPA buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Fifteen micrograms total proteins were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b1SMA, anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked, anti-Vinculin, anti-\u03b1Tubulin (1\u2009:\u2009500; 1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000 and 1\u2009:\u20091000, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), anti-CDH1, anti-Rab5B (1\u2009:\u20091000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-Flot1 (1\u2009:\u20091000; Cell Signalling, Boston, MA, USA), anti-Lamp2, anti-CD63, anti-COL1A1 (1\u2009:\u20091000, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1\u2009:\u200910\u2009000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The signals were visualized by ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).Gene expression profiling and analysis of public data setsTotal RNA derived from three independent biological samples of immortalized NFs transiently transfected with control (NFs/control) or miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) was isolated using QIAzolLysis Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA quantity was spectrophotometrically determined and the quality was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Only the samples with RNA Integrity Number greater than 8.0 were further processed for microarray analysis. For gene expression profiling, 800\u2009ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed, biotin-labeled and amplified using Illumina TotalPrepRNA Amplification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One microgram of each cRNA amplified sample was added to Hyb E1 hybridization buffer containing 37.5% (w/w) formamide and hybridized to array HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) at 58\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009h. Arrays were washed and stained using 1\u2009\u03bcg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Image files were quantified in Illumina BeadStudio version 3.3.8 and raw data were analyzed (variance stabilizing transformation, log2 transformation and quantile normalization) in R statistical environment using the lumi package implemented in Bioconductor. To reduce the non-biological experimental variation or batch effects we applied ComBat adjustment method to the normalized data. In all, 28\u2009668 mRNAs were evaluated with HumanHT-12 V4 (Illumina). Gene expression data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository (GEO) with accession number GSE76996. To identify differentially expressed genes between NFs/miR-9 and NFs/control, a moderate t-test was performed using limma package. Significant genes were selected based on a minimum log2 fold change of 0.7 and P<0.05. To define a significantly enrichment of Gene Ontology and pathways of the differentially expressed genes in the miR-9 transitory transfection model, the DAVID annotation chart tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and Reactome tool (http://www.reactome.org) were used and analyzed in Cytoscape. The significantly enrichment processes were defined based on the P<0.05. For public gene expression data of stromal breast tissues raw CEL files were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE10797 and GSE8977. Raw data were processed using the frozen robust multi-array average (frma) method as implemented in the \u2018frma' package of Bioconductor. ProbeSets annotation was retrieved from the hgu133plus2.db package and for probesets mapping on the same gene the one with highest mean expression across samples was selected. Differential expression of selected genes was assessed by two-tailed Student's t-test and a P-value <0.05 was considered for statistical significance.Tumor growth analysis in orthotopic xenograftsAll animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee for the Animal Experimentation of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan. Immortalized NFs (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) were transiently transfected with miR-9 precursor or control for 24\u2009h and co-injected with TNBC MDA-MB-468 (5.0 \u00d7 106 cells/mouse) in the mammary fat pad of 8-week-old female SCID mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA). Cells were resuspended in 200\u2009\u03bcl final volume of FGM-2 medium at a ratio 1\u2009:\u20091 with Matrigel. Tumor growth was monitored every 3\u20134 days until the time of killing and the volume (VT) was calculated according with the formula: VT=(S2 \u00d7 L)/2, where S and L correspond with the short and long dimension, respectively. Tumors were harvested after 16 days from the inocule.

As primary and metastatic tumors grow, the secretion of a considerable number of unbalanced factors is able to trigger the formation of new vessels through the process of angiogenesis. One of these factors, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), is a key mediator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis and a validated target for antiangiogenesis therapy in the clinic. However, extensive clinical experience targeting VEGF-VEGFR agents has shown that this is not always the case. For example, several phase III clinical trials failed to provide evidence of overall survival (OS) benefit in bevacizumab arms for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Small molecule antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), mainly against VEGFR2, have not shown efficacy in breast cancer treatment until today . These considerations, combined with the observation that tumor vessels can develop resistance to anti-VEGF therapy, highlight the need to identify effective anti-angiogenesis therapies that are based on VEGF-independent targets and can be used in combination with anti-VEGF independent therapy to improve outcomes for patients.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major stromal residents and a main producer of paracrine signals, are highly involved in the development of tumors through the secretion of cytokines and angiogenic factors. On the one hand, studies have revealed that CAFs may activate multiple signaling pathways in endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis by secreting versatile signaling molecules in addition to VEGFA. CAFs promote angiogenesis by recruiting endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into invasive human breast cancers, an effect mediated in part by SDF-1. Functionally, coculture of FAP-positive CAFs with endothelial cells can stimulate angiogenesis as measured by sprouting in colorectal cancer. Interestingly, CAFs from resistant EL4 tumors can also mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy via VEGF-independent PDGF-C signaling. On the other hand, the tumor stroma exhibits drastic changes at the transcriptional level, which can be useful prognostic predictors of cancer progression. Activation of the pleiotropic transcription factor STAT3 in CAFs promotes colorectal tumor development and correlates with poor prognosis. Strikingly, STAT3 effects in colorectal neoplasia may be at least partially due to modulation of proangiogenic signaling. Transcription factor ZEB1 deletion in stromal CAFs reduces the expression and secretion of a variety of paracrine signaling molecules, including FGF2, FGF7, VEGFA and IL6, to suppress tumor initiation, progression and metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer partially associated with decreased angiogenesis. However, the complicated mechanism underlying how breast CAFs promote VEGF-independent angiogenesis in transcriptional addiction is not well understood.Fos-like antigen 2 (FOSL2/FRA-2) belongs to the activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor family, which includes the various isoforms of Fos and Jun. FOSL2 exerts a specific function in bone development and systemic sclerosis (SSc) and appears to have selective physiological and pathological roles in diverse processes, including the development of immune cells and endocrinology processes. In addition, enhanced FOSL2 expression has been documented in some carcinomas, such as colon, hepatocellular, ovarian and breast cancer.Remarkably, FOSL2 transgenic mice resemble the core clinical features of SSc, as they display fibrotic and destructive microvascular manifestations of SSc. Increased local FOSL2 levels in cardiac perivascular adipose tissue (C-PVAT) possibly contribute to perivascular angiogenesis, inflammation, and fibrosis. AP-1 transcription factors (including FOSL2) act in concert to drive ischemia-induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) transcription, which plays an essential role in angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. However, the role of tumor stroma-derived FOSL2 signaling in tumors has not been clarified.Wnt5a, a secreted glycoprotein, belongs to the noncanonical Wnt family. Wnt5a and its downstream signaling pathway can regulate fundamental cellular processes, including specification of cell fate, proliferation, and survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that Wnt5a exhibits dual effects on tumor progression. For example, Wnt5a plays a pro-tumorigenic role in gastric cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, in contrast to thyroid and colorectal cancer. However, the role of Wnt5a in breast cancer is controversial and depends on the availability of key receptors and intercellular interactions among different cell types. Recently, new evidence has indicated that Wnt5a may play a role in angiogenesis and chemoresistance. Our mRNA expression profile suggested high expression of Wnt5a in breast CAFs. The interesting question of whether stromal Wnt5a in breast CAFs is involved in angiogenesis remains to be determined.Here, we are the first to probe the expression patterns of FOSL2 in breast CAFs and investigate the underlying mechanism, in which FOSL2 is critical for VEGF-independent angiogenesis by transcriptionally regulating Wnt5a. Moreover, we unveiled the clinical significance of the FOSL2/Wnt5a axis to gain insights into its pro-angiogenic function in the development and progression of breast carcinoma, suggesting potential novel therapeutic strategies for anti-angiogenic therapy.Material and MethodsClinical samples, stromal fibroblast isolation, immortalization, and cell cultureHuman breast tumor tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues (at least 5 cm away from tumor) were obtained from patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. All the patients involved in this study did not receive any radiotherapy or chemotherapy previously. The experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University.The isolation, immortalization, identification and culture of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from breast tumor patients were previously well established as described in our previous publication. NFs and CAFs were cultured in DMEM medium (GIBCO, USA) with 10% FBS (GIBCO, USA) at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HUVECs and MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% FBS at 37 \u00b0C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.RNA interference, plasmids, and reagentsFOSL2- or Wnt5a-knockdown cells were produced by lentivirus-mediated transduction using synthetic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) oligonucleotides (GenePharama, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were used to transiently knock down CYP19A1 or FZD5 (GenePharama, Shanghai, China). The sequences of shRNA and small interfering RNA used are listed in Table S1. FOSL2 overexpressing lentivirus were purchased from GeneCopoeia (Guangzhou, China), and viral supernatant was used to infect NFs in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene according to the manufacturer's instructions.The pcDNA3.1(+)-FOSL2 plasmid was created by amplifying FOSL2 from CAFs and was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) vector. The synthesized nucleotide wild type (WT), truncated or mutant (Mut) Wnt5a promoter was inserted into pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (GenePharma, China), respectively. The reagents used in this study are as follows: the neutralizing antibody against VEGF (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech, Switzerland), 0.2 mg/mL; axitinib (Selleck, USA), 5 nM; CCK8 (Beyotime, China), 5 mg/mL; SQ22536 (Selleck, China), 100 \u00b5M; H89 (Selleck, China), 5 \u00b5M; rWnt5a (R&D Systems, USA), 5 \u00b5g/mL; BOX5 (Merck Millipore, USA), 5 \u00b5M. The usage of rWnt5a and BOX5 in xenografts was described in animal experiments in detail.RNA extraction and qRT-PCRTotal-RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Takara, China) and was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara, China) by CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, USA). The primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in the Table S2.Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)The deparaffinized tissue sections at 4 \u00b5m thickness were heated for antigen retrieval at 95 \u00b0C in citric acid buffer (pH 6.0). After treating with 3% H2O2, the sections were blocked with 5% goat normal serum, and incubated with primary antibody against CD31 (1:100, ab9498, Abcam, UK) and FOSL2 (1:800, ab124830, Abcam, UK), separately. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by CD31 staining as described previously. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on preprepared coverslips for 24 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, treated by 0.1% triton-100, and incubated with 5% goat serum. The specific antibodies against \u03b1-SMA (1:150, ab5694, Abcam, UK), FAP (1:100, #66562, CST, USA) and CD31 (1:80, ab9498, Abcam, UK) were employed in the IF staining. The normal rabbit IgG was the negative control. The nuclei were stained with DAPI and the images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Japan).Luciferase assayCAFs (1\u00d7105 per well) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured overnight. The cells were transfected with the Wnt5a promoter vectors (pGL3-Wnt5a-WT, pGL3-Wnt5a-truncated, pGL3-Wnt5a-Mut), control vector pGL3 and internal control pRL-TK (Promega, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000. After culture for 30 h, the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega, USA), and luciferase activity was measured. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.Western blotting and ELISA assaysCell lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The specific primary antibodies used in western blotting analysis were as follows: FOSL2 (1:1000, ab124830, Abcam, UK), Wnt5a (1:1000, ab179824, Abcam, UK), VEGFA (1:1000, ab1316, Abcam, UK); p-VEGFR2 (1:800, D155165, Sangon, China), T-VEGFR2 (1:1000, D151118, Sangon, China); T-AKT (1:1000, #9272, CST, USA), p-AKT (1:1000, #2965, CST, USA), T-ERK (1:1000, #9102, CST, USA), p-ERK (1:1000, #4348, CST, USA), T-P65 (1:1000, #8242, CST, USA), p-P65 (1:1000, #3033, CST, USA) and \u03b2-actin (1:1000, Biosharp, China).For detection of secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of NFs and CAFs, proteins contained in the supernatant were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra15 Centrifugal Filter Device (Merck Millipore, USA). Concentrated supernatants (30 \u03bcL) were used for western blotting analysis. For ELISA, conditioned medium was collected from 1\u00d7106 NFs or CAFs in a 6-well plate, and the concentrations of VEGFA (Raybiotech, USA) and cAMP (R&D System, USA) were determined by a standard ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize the effect of cell number on the concentration of secreted proteins, supernatants from fibroblasts seeded at the same cell density were collected after a short incubation period (24 h), and cell numbers were counted at the CM collection time point. For detection of Wnt5a in patient serum and cellular Wnt5a of tumors, patients' peripheral venous blood was collected before surgery, and the blood and tumor tissue lysate were centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min to collect supernatants. The supernatants from serum and extracts of fresh tumor tissues were used to detect Wnt5a levels using an ELISA kit (Wuhan Purity Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and VEGF-neutralizing antibody treatmentThe stromal fibroblasts (1\u00d7106) were seeded into a 6-well plate in growth medium for 6 h. After removing the growth medium, FBS-free medium (1 mL) was added to further culture the cells for 24 h, and the supernatant was collected as conditioned medium (CM). To exclude the potential side effects of cell proliferation of CAFs and NFs (e.g., the engineered CAFs and NFs, and their control cells) on CM, cell proliferation, and protein concentration (using Bradford assay kit, Beyotime, China) of CM were carefully determined at the CM collection time point. For neutralization experiments, the neutralizing antibody against VEGF was preincubated at 4 \u00b0C with 1 mL supernatant for 6 h, and the removal of the VEGF effect in the supernatant was proved by ELISA assay. Then, the supernatant was used for HUVEC coculture in tubulogenesis or sprouting experiments. To rule out protein differences in the potential number of cells at the terminal time point of CM harvest, the protein concentration of CM derived from stromal fibroblasts was normalized using the protein concentration deviation value between the test fibroblasts and their control fibroblasts and adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration of control cells to diminish the personal error of cell planting.Invasion assaysStromal fibroblast-mediated HUVEC invasion was evaluated using an 8 \u00b5m pore chamber (Millipore, USA) coated with Matrigel (Corning, USA) as described previously. Cells were allowed to invade toward the medium in the lower chamber, and the invaded HUVECs on the opposite side of the filter were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and counted after 16 h.Tubule formation and three-dimensional sprouting assaysGrowth factor-reduced Matrigel basement membrane matrix (Corning, USA) was slowly thawed on ice, and 50 \u00b5L of Matrigel was added to each well of a 96-well plate for polymerization. A total of 1\u00d7104 suspended HUVECs were added on top of the Matrigel matrix and treated with the supernatants from CM pretreated with or without VEGF-neutralizing antibody, axitinib, rWnt5a (5 \u00b5g/mL) or BOX5 (a Wnt5a antagonist, 5 \u00b5M) for 24 h. After incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h, pictures were captured in a 40\u00d7 field and analyzed using ImageJ software. For endothelial cell sprouting assays, HUVECs (1\u00d7103) were cultured with medium containing 0.24% carboxymethylcellulose in nonadherent round-bottom 96-well plates overnight. Spheroids were collected by centrifugation at 400 \u00d7 g and mixed with 2 mg/mL collagen type I (Corning, USA) and FBS-free medium. The three-dimensional fibrin gel was then covered with CM and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for at least 24 h. Endothelial sprouting was analyzed with at least 10 spheroids per group and quantified by recording the branch number under a microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assayChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin IP Kit (Magnetic Beads) #9005 (CST, USA). Three primer sets were designed to flank the related putative FOSL2-binding sites in the promoter region of VEGF (Table S3). Briefly, FOSL2-transfected NFs (1.2\u00d7107) were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and sonicated (60 W). Then, the chromatin associated with FOSL2 was pulled down using an anti-FOSL2 antibody or control human IgG. The amounts of the specific DNA fragments were then quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and normalized to the genomic DNA prepared from the same cells. Each group was analyzed in triplicate.E2 production assayCells were seeded in six-well plates (2\u00d7106 cells/well) and cultured to 50% confluence. Testosterone was added at 100 nM. The cells were cultured for 48 h, and the medium was harvested for E2 detection using the Access E2 Immunoassay System (Beckman Coulter, USA) in the Endocrinology Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.Orthotopic xenograftsThe orthotopic tumor xenograft models were generated as described previously. Animal experiments were approved by the animal care ethics committees at Chongqing Medical University. MDA-MB-231 cells (1\u00d7106) were mixed with an equal number of CAFs/scramble, CAFs/shFOSL2, NFs/vector or NFs/FOSL2 in 200 \u00b5L of PBS:Matrigel at a 1:1 ratio and subcutaneously injected into 4-week-old female nude mice (7 mice per group). Tumor size was measured by calipers every 4 days; volume was calculated ((L \u00d7 W2) \u00d7 0.5). When the tumor volume was approximately 50 mm3, a group of mice implanted with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/scramble or CAF/shFOSL2 was separately intraperitoneally administered anti-VEGF antibody (5 mg/kg, twice a week; for 5 consecutive weeks) (Bevacizumab; Roche/Genentech); a group of mice injected with mixtures of MDA-MB-231 and CAF/shFOSL2 was treated with rWNT5A (1 ng/1 g body weight, twice weekly, for 5 consecutive weeks); and a group of tumor burden mice with MDA-MB-231 and NF/FOSL2 was injected with BOX5 (0.5 \u00b5g/1 g body weight, once per day, for 5 consecutive weeks). The mice were sacrificed, and xenografts were harvested at 40 days. At the end of animal experiments, tumors were serially sectioned into 4 \u03bcm sections and stained with CD31 for subsequent blinded evaluation of MVD.ResultsHigh FOSL2 expression in breast stromal CAFs is closely associated with tumor angiogenesis and clinical progressStudies investigating the link between CAFs and angiogenesis have been increasingly revealing and demonstrating that the crosstalk between CAFs and endothelial cells facilitates multiple hallmark processes in angiogenesis, where CAFs can even mediate resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. To better understand the characteristics and functions of CAFs associated with tumor angiogenesis, we set out to investigate the transcriptome of breast stromal fibroblasts by microarray analysis using primary CAFs and NFs derived from breast tumor tissues. A set of transcription factors was found to be upregulated in CAFs. Among them, 20 transcription factors were inversely downregulated in preeclampsia (PE) (Figure 1A). The placental phenotype of PE is largely attributed to vascular dysfunction of the placenta, which has been driven by an imbalance of angiogenic signals. PE is concomitant with significantly altered decreased angiogenic factors (VEGF, placental growth factor (PLGF), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2)) and increased soluble antiangiogenic factors (e.g., soluble fmslike tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and soluble endoglin (sEng)). As shown in the heatmap of the 20 TFs from the mRNA microarray (Figure 1B), FOSL2, SATB1 and GATA6 in CAFs were identified as candidate transcription factors in the progression of angiogenesis in breast cancer. We isolated 12 pairs of primary CAFs and corresponding NFs from breast cancer and noncancer tissues, and the purities of CAFs were identified by the activated fibroblast biomarkers \u03b1-SMA, FAP and vascular endothelial marker CD31 (a biomarkers of endothelial cells as control) as previously reported (Figure S1A). After analysis of other conventional CAF marker genes (e.g. S100A4, PDGFR\u03b2, PDPN, and CAV1), S100A4 and CAV1 were found to be increased in primary breast CAFs compared with NFs at the mRNA level (Figure S1B). The expression of three candidate transcription factors was then verified in 3 cases of primary mammary fibroblasts from breast reduction surgery and 12 paired primary breast CAFs and NFs by qRT-PCR, and FOSL2 had the most significant and stable expression in primary CAFs (Figure S1C). Subsequently, the high level of FOSL2 protein was almost confirmed in 12 paired primary CAFs by western blotting analysis (Figure 1C). Likewise, the high level of FOSL2 in immortalized CAFs was also detected by qRT-PCR (Figure S1D) and western blotting (Figure 1D), which had a similar expression pattern as in primary CAFs (thus, the immortalized CAFs could be used as a cell model in this study). To further understand the expression of stromal FOSL2 in breast tumor tissues and evaluate the correlation of stromal FOSL2 with the clinical characteristics of breast cancer, FOSL2 proteins were examined in 117 paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Detailed information on stromal FOSL2 expression and the clinical characteristics of breast cancer patients are listed in Table S3. The high level of stromal FOSL2 was significantly related to tumor stage (Figure S1E and Figure 1E). In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that the expression of stromal FOSL2 was inversely correlated with the overall survival of patients (Figure 1F). Meanwhile, the denser microvessel density (MVD), which was evaluated by CD31 staining, was greater in stromal FOSL2 highly expressed tumor tissues than in stromal FOSL2 low expressed tissues (p<0.001) (Figure 1G-H). The correlation between the levels of FOSL2 mRNA and the microvessel biomarker CD31 was discerned from the analysis of bulk data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the results revealed a positive correlation between FOSL2 mRNA expression and CD31 expression (Figure 1I). Using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, we found that the FOSL2-regulated gene signature was positively correlated with the enrichment of angiogenesis-related gene signaling (Figure 1J, and Figure S1F). Collectively, these data indicate that FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts potentially affects angiogenesis in breast tumors.Enhanced FOSL2 in CAFs contributes to breast tumor angiogenesisTo examine the role of FOSL2 in angiogenic behavior, we successfully established endogenous FOSL2 stably knocked down CAFs (CAFs/shFOSL2) and ectopic FOSL2 stably expressed NFs (NFs/FOSL2), which were confirmed at both the mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2A-B). Ectopic FOSL2 in NFs or FOSL2 silencing in CAFs led to activation of NFs or inactivation of CAFs, as identified by \u03b1-SMA (Figure S2A). By employing a coculture system including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and conditioned medium (CM) derived from CAFs or NFs, we observed a significant decrease in the invasion potential of HUVECs and the cumulative number of tubes in the coculture group treated with supernatant derived from FOSL2-silenced CAFs compared with the group treated with supernatant derived from the control CAFs (Figure 2C, top panels; Figure 2D-E). To better mimic in vivo blood vessel formation, we conducted HUVEC spheroid sprouting assays in 3D culture. The results showed that the cumulative sprout length (CSL) was significantly shorter in the system group treated with supernatant from FOSL2-knockdown CAFs than in the control group (Figure 2C, top panels; Figure 2F). In contrast, the invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting abilities of HUVECs were dramatically enhanced by CM from FOSL2-overexpressing NFs (Figure 2C, bottom panels; Figure 2D-F). To adequately understand the pro-angiogenic functions of the CM derived from the engineered CAFs or NFs, we evaluated the different types of vectors on the cell proliferation of CAFs or NFs and the protein concentrations in the medium at the terminal time point of the experiment. The proliferation of CAFs or NFs was not significantly influenced by FOSL2 expression (Figure S2B). The protein concentrations between NFs and CAFs in FBS-free medium or in 10% FBS-containing growth medium also had no significant differences at the terminal time point of CM (Figure S2C-D), indicating that the pro-angiogenic behavior of CM was just induced by FOSL2 levels in CAFs or NFs. Previous studies revealed that FOSL2 was abundantly expressed in breast tumor cells. The effect of CM derived from CAFs or NFs on tumor cells was evaluated. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 breast cancer cells cocultured with CM from FOSL2-silenced CAFs had reduced proliferation (Figure S2E-F) and invasive ability (Figure S2G-I) in comparison with CM from control CAFs. In contrast, the proliferation (Figure S2E-F) and invasion (Figure S2G-I) abilities of breast tumor cells were increased by CM from FOSL2-overexpressing NFs. Taken together, these results suggest that FOSL2 in breast CAFs plays a positive role in angiogenesis.FOSL2 promotes CAF angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent mannerAmong the known angiogenic regulators, VEGFA is a key mediator. We thus evaluated whether FOSL2 can regulate VEGFA expression in breast CAFs. Loss of endogenous FOSL2 in CAFs or transduction of ectopic FOSL2 into NFs had almost no effect on VEGF expression (Figure 3A, and Figure S3A). Consistently, FOSL2 expression was found to be extremely limited in association with VEGFA levels analyzed using TCGA database (Figure S3B, r=0.17, p<0.001). Concomitantly, knockdown of FOSL2 in CAFs or overexpression of ectopic FOSL2 in NFs had no effect on VEGFA secretion in the supernatants derived from these engineered fibroblasts and the corresponding control cells (Figure 3B). Indeed, CM derived from CAFs or ectopic FOSL2-expressing NFs maintained the ability to promote tubule formation and sprouting of HUVECs in the presence of anti-VEGF antibody (Figure 3C-F) or axitinib (an inhibitor of VEGFR) (Figure S3C-F). These data suggest a VEGF-independent proangiogenic function of FOSL2 in CAFs.FOSL2 is regulated by estrogen/cAMP/PKA signalingThe mammary gland is a complex organ that undergoes hormonally regulated changes. CAFs are the major cell type in stroma that converts androgens into estrogen by aromatase, a critical, rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of estrogen in the breast cancer microenvironment. As expected, the mRNA level of aromatase (CYP19A1) (Figure 4A and Figure S4A) and the amount of synthesized estrogen (E2) were notably higher in CAFs than in NFs (Figure 4B). Our previous study found that E2 could efficiently activate downstream signaling through the cAMP/PKA axis in breast stromal fibroblasts. Indeed, more intracellular cAMP production was detected in CAFs or in NFs treated with E2 (Figure 4C). We asked whether FOSL2 expression could be regulated by the estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in CAFs. Astoundingly, the increased FOSL2 levels in immortalized or primary CAFs were notably reduced by SQ22536 (a cAMP inhibitor) (Figure 4D, and Figure S4B) and H89 (a PKA inhibitor) (Figure 4E, and Figure S4C); conversely, a higher level of FOSL2 was detected in immortalized or primary NFs stimulated by E2 (Figure 4F, and Figure S4D). Furthermore, efficient knockdown of CYP19A1 in CAFs (Figure 4G) led to decreased FOSL2 (Figure 4H-I). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the local estrogen/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in breast CAFs is involved in regulating FOSL2 expression.FOSL2 transcriptionally activates Wnt5a and leads to increased Wnt5a secretion from CAFsTo further explore the functions of stromal FOSL2 in regulating angiogenesis, we identified target genes of FOSL2 by merging the data acquired from targets predicted by the Cistrome database (http://cistrome.org/db/) with the potential genes associated with angiogenesis and secretion of extracellular proteins from the AmiGO database (http://amigo.geneontology.org/). Sixty-eight candidates that may be regulated by FOSL2 and related to angiogenesis were identified (Figure 5A). After comparison with our mRNA expression profile of CAFs/NFs, 14 candidate genes were aberrantly expressed in breast CAFs (Figure 5B). Using a protein network analysis, we found that Wnt5a was in the core of the network among these potential transcriptional targets of FOSL2, indicating that Wnt5a is a major candidate target of FOSL2 (Figure S5A). In accordance with this finding and our previous RNA-sequencing data of CAFs/NFs, Wnt5a was markedly upregulated in breast tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumor tissues using a public database including 1085 cases of tumors and 291 cases of normal tissues (Figure S5B), suggesting increased Wnt5a in the tumor stroma. Further analysis proved that Wnt5a was significantly changed at the mRNA and protein levels in FOSL2-knockdown CAFs or FOSL2-overexpressing NFs (Figure 5C-D). To further understand whether Wnt5a is a direct transcriptional target of FOSL2, a bioinformatics analysis and sets of experiments were carried out. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there were three potential FOSL2 binding consensus sequences (E1, E2 and E3) in the Wnt5a promoter (Figure 5E). Checked by luciferase reporter assay, we found that the reporter containing E2 (Figure 5E) had high transcriptional activity (Figure 5F, upper panel), and mutation of the E2 motif (Figure 5E) notably decreased luciferase activity (Figure 5F, down panel), which was further confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 5G), suggesting that consensus E2 is essential for FOSL2-mediated transcriptional activity of Wnt5a. Consistently, more Wnt5a-secreting CAFs were detected than NFs, and the concentration of Wnt5a secreted in the supernatant was significantly reduced in FOSL2-knockdown CAFs compared with that in control CAFs. Conversely, there was increased Wnt5a secretion in FOSL2-overexpressing NFs compared with that in control NFs (Figure 5H). These data demonstrate that FOSL2 can directly regulate Wnt5a expression.Wnt5a plays an essential role in the FOSL2-mediated promotion of angiogenesis in CAFsTo investigate the pro-angiogenic role of Wnt5a in breast CAFs, we transfected a retrovirus-mediated shRNA specifically against Wnt5a in CAFs and an ectopic Wnt5a construct into NFs. Wnt5a overexpression in NFs (NF/Wnt5a) or loss of endogenous Wnt5a in CAFs (CAFs/shWnt5a) resulted in marked changes in the invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting abilities of HUVECs (Figure S5C), indicating that Wnt5a, as a downstream target of FOSL2, is essential for CAF-promoting angiogenesis function. Next, we examined the Wnt5a-dependent angiogenesis role of FOSL2 in CAFs. Treatment of HUVECs with supernatant derived from FOSL2-silenced CAFs reduced the cell invasion (Figure 6A, upper panels; Figure 6B, left panel), tube formation (Figure 6C, upper panels; Figure 6D, left panel) and spheroid sprouting (Figure 6E, upper panels; Figure 6F, left panel) potential of HUVECs. The addition of rWnt5a into the supernatant from FOSL2-silenced CAFs rescued the cell invasion, tube formation and spheroid sprouting potential of HUVECs, which resulted from the loss of FOSL2 in CAFs (Figure 6A-F). In contrast, the promoting effects on cell invasion, tubule formation and spheroid sprouting of HUVECs were observed in CM derived from ectopic FOSL2 NFs and mitigated by treatment of the CM with BOX5, a Wnt5a antagonist (Figure 6A, 6C and 6E, down panels; Figure 6B, 6D and 6F, right panels). Thus, this evidence supports the Wnt5a-dependent angiogenesis role of stromal FOSL2 in breast cancer.Wnt5a derived from CAFs activates FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling in endothelial cellsWnt5a can induce signal transduction in target cells by binding to its receptors, the Frizzled family (FZDs), a cysteine-rich seven transmembrane receptor family. We asked whether CAF-derived Wnt5a could bind to FZD5, a potential member of the Frizzled family in HUVECs, and stimulate possible downstream signaling pathways. Efficient knockdown of FZD5 in HUVECs (Figure 7A) abolished the cell invasion and tubule formation abilities of HUVECs even in the presence of rWnt5a (Figure 7B-D), suggesting that FZD5 is necessary for Wnt5a in angiogenesis. Several signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, ERK and AKT, are potential downstream signaling pathways of FZDs; thus, the activation of NF-\u03baB, ERK and AKT signaling in HUVECs was examined. As shown in Figure 7E, loss of FOSL2 or Wnt5a in CAFs significantly quenched the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK in HUVECs stimulated by CAF CM. Similarly, loss of FZD5 in HUVECs rendered NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling unable to respond to CAF CM, and addition of rWnt5a in FBS-free medium directly activated these signaling pathways in HUVECs (Figure 7E-F). However, the activation of VEGFR2 was not affected by silencing FOSL2, Wnt5a, or FZD5 or by exogenous supplementation with rWnt5a. Meanwhile, Wnt5a, as a representative member of the noncanonical Wnt proteins, has been reported to play dual roles in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. We found that Wnt5a could stimulate the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in HUVECs (Figure 7F) and thereby promote angiogenesis. These data demonstrate that the Wnt5a/FZD5 axis stimulates the activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK signaling in HUVECs.CAFs promote breast tumor angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner to fuel breast tumor growth in vivoTo further investigate the proangiogenesis function of the FOSL2/Wnt5a signaling axis in vivo, a mixture of the indicated cells was subcutaneously injected into nude mice. Compared with the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, the tumor burden mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells mixed with FOSL2-silenced CAFs had fewer blood vessels on the tumor surface and less CD31 staining in tumor tissue; the tumor burden mice injected with a mixture of MDA-MB-231 and FOSL2-overexpressing NFs had more blood vessels and a large tumor size (Figure 8A and Figure S6A). To confirm the number differences of blood vessels attributing to angiogenesis, the mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (CDH5), a strictly endothelial marker, and prosperohomeobox protein1 (prox1), a biomarker for lymphatic endothelial cells were detected in the tumor samples (Figure S6B). The high level of VE-cadherin closely related with microvessel density based on CD31 staining rather than prox1 expression. In contrast to blockage of VEGF signaling alone by anti-VEGF antibody, FOSL2 knockdown in CAFs combined with VEGF signaling inhibitors could augment the suppressive efficiencies to tumor angiogenesis, indicating that FOSL2 acted as an obviously proangiogenic effector in the VEGF-independent pathway. Consistently, treating mice with Wnt5a, the critical pro-angiogenic factor regulated by FOSL2, could partly rescue blood vessels and tumor growth of tumor burden mice injected with FOSL2-silenced CAFs (labeled CAF/shFOSL2 + rWnt5a) in comparison to their control tumors (labeled CAF/shFOSL2). The tumor burden mice injected with NFs had fewer blood vessels and small tumors, and ectopic FOSL2 in NFs could significantly promote blood vessels and tumor growth. However, treatment of tumor burden mice injected with FOSL2-overexpressing NFs using BOX5 (Wnt5a antagonist) mitigated FOSL2-stimulated blood vessels and tumor growth (Figure 8B-C and Figure S6C). In addition, we found that knockdown of FOSL2 in CAFs could increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to VEGF inhibitors in vivo (Figure 8A-C, Figure S6A-C). Similarly, loss of Wnt5a, the direct target of FOSL2, in CAFs significantly decreased tumor blood vessel formation and tumor growth (Figure S6D-F). To further evaluate the clinical value of FOSL2-regulated Wnt5a involved in angiogenesis, we detected secreted Wnt5a levels in serum from 71 breast cancer patients and Wnt5a levels in corresponding tumor tissues or secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of primary stromal fibroblasts isolated from 12 pairs of nontumor and tumor samples and the corresponding FOSL2 expression and vessel density of tumors. High levels of secreted Wnt5a were detected in patient serum, and enhanced serum Wnt5a was positively correlated with microvessel density in breast tumors (Figure 8D). The FOSL2 protein levels in tumor tissues were closely related to the Wnt5a concentration in tumor extracts (Figure 8E). Moreover, the FOSL2 levels in primary stromal CAFs were much higher than those in the corresponding primary NFs, and the enhanced stromal FOSL2 was almost correlated with a high concentration of secreted Wnt5a in the supernatant of CAFs (Figure 8F and S6G), confirming that FOSL2-regulated Wnt5a in stromal CAFs was close to clinical angiogenesis. Collectively, the current study reveals a novel function of breast CAFs. The increased FOSL2 in CAFs plays a pivotal role in promoting angiogenesis by regulating Wnt5a, thus stimulating activation of the downstream FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling axis in vascular endothelial cells to fuel tumor angiogenesis VEGF-independent patterns.DiscussionThe identification of angiogenesis as a prerequisite for the outgrowth of solid tumors boosts the field of angiogenesis research. However, enthusiasm for angiostatic therapy has been hampered due to the limited beneficial effect of these anti-angiogenesis agents on patient survival, especially in breast cancers. The tumor microenvironment (TME) has been considered to play an important role in tumor angiogenesis. In particular, CAFs are gradually viewed as the chief architects of the TME due to their multiple functions, including tumor angiogenesis with intimate crosstalk between endothelial cells. In this study, we identified that the transcriptional factor FOSL2 may act as a novel tumor angiogenesis target in breast CAFs. The enhanced FOSL2 in breast CAFs was induced by endogenous aromatase through the E2/cAMP/PKA pathway. Furthermore, the activated CAFs induced by FOSL2 could not promote VEGF but could promote Wnt5a expression, which stimulated angiogenesis through FZD5/NF-\u03baB/ERK signaling, even under the blockage of classical VEGF signaling by anti-VEGF antibody and axitinib. Collectively, the current study suggests that targeting FOSL2 in stromal CAFs may be an effective alternative to overcome tumor refractoriness to anti-VEGF signaling treatment.Transcription factors (TFs) coordinate the expression of target genes typically through cis-regulatory DNA elements. A small set of lineage-specific master TFs dictate the core transcriptional programs governing cell identity and malignant state. Elucidating the core transcriptional regulatory mechanisms is necessary to understand the fundamentals of molecular carcinogenesis. A more recent study has revealed that stomach and intestinal lineage-specific programs are reactivated in Sox2high/Sox9high and Cdx2high cancers by comparing the gastrointestinal lineage-specific transcriptome to human gastrointestinal cancer data, which highlights the importance of developmental lineage programs reactivated by gastrointestinal TFs in cancer. Strikingly, a novel study has determined that TFs of the FOS family are significantly variable for single E18 fetal mouse mammary cells when compared with the permutated background, suggesting that these factors may contribute to cellular differentiation programs. Herein, we found that FOSL2 was upregulated in activated CAFs of breast cancers. The links between FOSL2-mediated breast development and breast tumor angiogenesis suggest that targeting FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts may have significant value for breast cancer therapy. Meanwhile, we found that FOSL2 was downregulated in preeclampsia (PE) by analyzing the transcriptome of PE, which was ascribed to decreased angiogenesis signaling. These works support our findings that FOSL2 in breast CAFs plays a crucial role in angiogenesis.The role of CAFs in tumor angiogenesis architecture is increasingly dominant in breast tissues. The focus of our study on breast CAFs in angiogenesis is promising. Recently, in an MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer, the issue of heterogeneity of CAFs was distinguished by the global gene expression profile using single-cell RNA sequencing. Of note, there are three subtypes of mouse CAFs, including vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs), that are significantly enriched by gene ontology (GO) sets. The vCAF signatures, close to vascular development and angiogenesis, are highly conserved in patient samples of breast tumors. Therefore, antagonizing CAFs as an antiangiogenic treatment modality for breast cancer opens the possibility for biomarker-driven development of drugs for precision therapy.Stromal CAF populations, which engage in pleiotropic processes in tumor angiogenesis, are pivotal to the resistance of VEGF blockade. It has been shown that resistance to antiangiotherapy is partly involved in angio-stimulatory growth factor redundancy and multiplicity. In a seminal paper, compression-induced expression of glycolysis genes in CAFs correlates with angiogenesis gene expression in breast cancer. Tumor-induced compression might inevitably be a sustained driver for angiogenesis-related gene expression to cause the redundancy of angiogenesis growth factors. Meanwhile, tumor angiogenesis can become VEGF independent at a more advanced stage because of the production of other proangiogenesis molecules and thus respond poorly to VEGF blockade. The release of multiple angiogenesis factors, such as SDF-1 and PDGF-C, by CAFs contributes to resistance. Our studies support that, likewise, although VEGFA is considerably expressed in breast CAFs, FOSL2 is one of the key players in promoting angiogenesis in a VEGF-independent manner. FOSL2 in stromal fibroblasts promotes angiogenesis by inducing Wnt5a transcription.Aberrant Wnt5a signaling is an important event in tumor progression, with oncogenic or tumor-suppressing effects dependent on tumor types. In breast cancer, the respectable evidence supports that Wnt5a has oncogenic activity. For example, elevated Wnt5a was detected in basal-like breast cancer cells at both the mRNA and protein levels, and loss of Wnt5a could efficiently inhibit tumor growth in SUM1315 cells in vivo . In addition, GLIS1, a novel hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, was reported to increase the migration and invasion capacities of breast cancer cells by upregulating Wnt5a, and Wnt5a levels were associated with poorer prognosis in breast cancer patients. Notably, several studies reported that Wnt5a was highly expressed in breast stromal cells and associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. For example, enhanced Wnt5a was proven in breast tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which induced invasiveness of breast cancer cells and production of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in macrophages. A whole-transcriptome analysis of selectively retrieved engulfing breast cancer cells identified a gene signature of mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) engulfment consisting of Wnt5a, which enhanced distant metastasis. Another study revealed that Wnt5a in breast CAFs was significantly downregulated after 1,25D (1alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) treatment, in which 1,25D elicited obvious tumor suppressive effects. In addition, the role of Wnt5a is emerging in the promotion of proinflammatory and immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, Wnt5a signaling has been found to be required for the pathological angiogenesis. In a study, the reduced vascularization of matrigel plugs in conditional deletion of the Wnt secretion factor Evi in mouse ECs (Evi-ECKO) could be rescued by introduction of non-canonical Wnt5a. The release of Wnt5a from infiltrating monocytes is especially important to drive angiogenesis in inflamed vessels. In addition, Wnt5a has been disclosed to play essential role in tumor angiogenesis, such as melanoma and glioblastoma. However, whether Wnt5a derived from stromal cell acting a role in angiogenesis has poor understanding. In one research, CD163 positive tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) may induce angiogenesis via crosstalk with malignant epithelial cells to promote Wnt5a expression. Here, we confirmed that the increased stromal Wnt5a plays a crucial role in VEGF-independent angiogenesis in breast cancer. Our findings provide important evidence for its oncogenic role in the breast tumor microenvironment, which suggests that targeting Wnt5a in the breast TME may provide a potential option for antiangiogenesis therapy in breast cancer.Together, our study supports the notion that stromal CAFs promote VEGF-independent pro-angiogenesis processes in breast cancer, and FOSL2-mediated Wnt5a expression and activation of downstream signaling are crucial for VEGF-independent angiogenesis of breast CAFs. The elucidation of reciprocal interactions of breast CAFs with endothelial cells may inspire the development of conceptually novel targeted therapeutics with the aim of thwarting the FOSL2/Wnt5a axis of breast tumor angiogenesis.Supplementary MaterialTumor angiogenesis: therapeutic implicationsVEGF in Signaling and Disease: Beyond Discovery and DevelopmentResistance and escape from

According to immunohistochemical typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), breast cancer can be divided into 4 types: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a special type of breast cancer in which ER, PR, and HER2 expressions are all negative. Due to this characteristic, efficient therapy for breast cancer, such as endocrine therapy and Herceptin targeted therapy, cannot be used for TNBC in clinical practice. The most common treatment for primary TNBC patients is surgical therapy, followed by chemotherapy. With treatment, patients can quickly achieve complete remission; however, tumor metastasis can easily occur in lungs, liver, bones, and brain, and metastasis is the most common cause of treatment failure and mortality.To solve this clinical problem, numerous studies have been performed. One theory considers that tumor cells do not exist separately, but rather grow in a \u201ctumor microenvironment (TME)\u201d in vivo, and various cells and cytokines cooperate with each other in this microenvironment, activating many aspects of tumorigenesis. One such cells type is fibroblasts, which are the most abundant cellular components in TME; they can transform into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) once activated by tumor cells. The characteristics of CAFs are expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1), while expressions of these proteins is nearly negative in normal fibroblasts (NFs). Many researchers reported that CAFs play an important role in malignant tumor initiation, progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis by producing a plethora of chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.CAFs can affect the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells in different ways, such as promoting breast cancer cells to engage in the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. A previous study by our team found that the EMT process can be induced in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by overexpression of Beclin 1 gene (an autophagic regulator gene), thus enhancing the autophagic level of cells. As autophagy is a conservative lysosomal degradation pathway that mediates the clearance of cytoplasmic components in most kinds of cells, autophagy can also happen in CAFs. However, because CAFs affect breast cancer cell progression in different ways, the precise effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells is still unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether CAFs autophagy can enhance the metastatic potential of TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, which might be useful for the clinical treatment of TNBC in the future.Material and MethodsSpecimensFresh specimens were collected under sterile conditions from 5 patients who had primary invasive TNBC and who accepted radical mastectomy at Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University. Written consent was obtained from the patients and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital.CAFs and NFs cultureFresh specimens and adjacent normal breast tissue samples (>3\u20135 cm away from the tumor) were collected from 5 TNBC patients in Zhujiang Hospital. The specimens were sectioned into 1-mm3 pieces and digested with 1 ml 0.12% collagenase A in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2 for 8 h, after which the digestion was stopped by supplementation with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, Gibco, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA). Tissue debris was removed and cells were collected and cultured in a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Once cells reached 80% confluence, they were harvested and reseeded.CAFs conditioned medium (CAFs-CM) and NFs conditioned medium (NFs-CM) were prepared as follows: CAFs and NBFs in logarithmic growth phase were harvested, cell density was adjusted to 1\u00d7106/mL, and a total of 20 mL cells were inoculated in a 75-cm2 cell culture flask. When cells reached 80\u201390% confluency, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, then the suspension was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until use.TNBC cell lines cultureBT-549, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were obtained from the Cell Bank of Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and cultured within a 37\u00b0C humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2.Immunofluorescence stainingCAFs and NFs were seeded on the coverslips and cultured routinely. Once cells reached 50\u201370% confluence, they were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS for 3 times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mL Triton-100 (0.5%) for 20 min and blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Jiawei, China) for 20 min. Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-\u03b1-SMA 1: 300, anti-E-Cadherin, and anti-vimentin 1: 200 100 \u03bcl) at 4\u00b0C for 8\u201310 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (GeneCopoeia, USA) for 1\u20132 h. Nuclei were stained by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, GeneCopoeia, USA). Cells were observed using a fluorescence inverted microscope (IX71 Olympus, Japan), cytoplasmic staining was excitated with a 495-nm wavelength laser, and nucleus staining was excitated with a 358-nm wavelength laser.CAFs autophagy inhibition evaluationCAFs were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FBS, as well as 5 mM 3-Methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitors) for 24 h, then culture medium was removed and DMEM plus 10% FBS was added again. Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I conversion were evaluated by Western blot at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h.TNBC cell migration and invasion analysisFor migration and invasion assay, 8-uM pore size Transwell inserts (BD Biosciences, USA) were used. Invasion ability of TNBC cells was evaluated by Matrigel-coated Transwell and migration ability was evaluated by Transwell inserts. We added 2.5\u00d7104 TNBC cells in 200 \u03bcl to the upper chamber. For the CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added into the lower chamber. For the 3-MA-CAFs group, 5\u00d7104 CAFs in 600 \u03bcl was added by 5 mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed to DMEM plus 10% FBS. For the NFs group, 5\u00d7104 NFs in 600 \u03bcl was added. For the control group, 600 \u03bcl DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. Cells were routinely co-cultured for 48 h. Migrating or invading cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, followed by crystal violet indicator (Sigma, USA) staining. Cell numbers were counted under a microscope at \u00d7400 magnification.TNBC cell growth assayTNBC cell growth was assessed by 3-(4,5-Dimet-hylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Amresco, USA) assay. We cultured 2.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells in 96-well plates. For the CAFs-CM group, 200 ul CAFs-CM was added. For the 3-MA-CAFs-CM group, CAFs was added by 5-mM concentration of 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS and a total of 200 ul medium was added. For the NFs-CM group, 200 ul NFs-CM was added. For the control group 200 ul DMEM plus 10% FBS was added. At 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, 20 \u03bcl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 200 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma, USA) was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorption (optical density [OD] value) was measured at 570 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, USA).Western blot assayHarvested cells were lysed with newly-prepared protein lysis buffer for 20\u201325 min on ice, and homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 25 min at 4. Supernatants were collected and protein content was qualified by use of a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Beyotime, China) according to the protocol: Copper was chelated with protein and reacted with BCA, and the BCA/copper complex exhibited a strong linear absorbance at 562 nm with increasing protein concentrations. Each sample of proteins (20 \u03bcg) was separated and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Germany). Then, the membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat milk dissolved in phosphate buffer solution with Tween-20 (PBST) at room temperature for 2 h and was incubated with primary antibodies anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-Beclin 1, anti-E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, and anti-P-GSK-3\u03b2 (Santa Cruz, USA) or 1: 1000 anti-\u03b2-Tubulin (Cell Signal Technology, USA) overnight at 4\u00b0 on a rotator. FITC-labeled secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was added, and the membrane was incubated and protected from light for 2 h on a rotator. Protein signals were visualized sing the Odyssey Scan system (LI-COR, USA) in 700\u2013800 nm channel, band intensities were quantified by the software of image j1.44, and fold changes in the intensity of protein signals were the mean value of the results.StatisticsThe data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard error for at least 3 separate determinations. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for the results of Western blot, cell migration, and cell invasion assay, and repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine the difference between groups for the results of MTT. Data were processed with SPSS 13.0 software. P<0.05 was considered as significant.ResultsCAFs isolated from breast cancer tissues exhibited characteristics of CAFsWestern blot showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin could be detected but epithelial marker E-cadherin could not be detected, both in CAFs and NFs. Particularly, myofibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA was significantly higher in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 1A).Immunofluorescence staining also showed \u03b1-SMA and vimentin expressions were significantly higher in CAFs cytoplasm than in NFs cytoplasm (P<0.05) (Figure 1B, 1C). However, E-cadherin expression was negative in CAFs and NFs (Figure 1B, 1C).CAFs autophagic level could be detected by relevant proteinsBeclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion, which represented the level of cell autophagy, was detected in CAFs by Western blot and was higher than the level of NFs (P<0.05). P62, which is a downstream protein regulated by LC 3, was significantly lower in CAFs than in NFs (P<0.05) (Figure 2A). However, the expression of Beclin 1, LC3-II/I conversion, and P62 was reversed by 3-MA, indicating that the autophagic level of CAFs can be inhibited by 3-MA (Figure 2B). To detect the duration of the 3-MA inhibiting effect on CAFs autophagy, CAFs were first added to 3-MA for 24 h, then the medium was changed into DMEM plus 10% FBS, Beclin 1, and LC3-II/I conversion levels at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h were significantly lower than without 3-MA (P<0.05) (Figure 2C).CAFs autophagy enhanced migration and invasion of TNBC cellsCell migration assay indicated the numbers of cells in BT-549 were 40.8\u00b12.14 in the control group, 40.2\u00b12.32 in the NFs group, 64.0\u00b12.12 in the CAFs group, and 38.6\u00b11.85 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. The number of cells in the CAFs group was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3A, 3B, Table 1). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3B, Table 1).Cell invasion assay indicated there were 34.2\u00b11.72 cells in the BT-549 control group, 33.4\u00b11.50 in the NFs group, 51.8\u00b11.92 in the CAFs group, and 32.8\u00b11.67 in the 3-MA-CAFs group. There were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, there were significantly more cells in the CAFs group than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 3C, Table 2).CAFs autophagy enhanced TNBC cells proliferationMTT assay indicated that the proliferation rates in the 4 groups of cells in BT-549 were significantly different; among them, the CAFs group rate was the highest and the 3-MA-CAFs group was the lowest (P<0.05) (Figure 4A). The same phenomenon was observed in MDA-MB-231 (P<0.05) (Figure 4B). For MDA-MB-468, the CAFs group rate was significantly higher than in the other 3 groups (P<0.05) (Figure 4C), while the 3-MA-CAFs group was not significantly lower than in the NFs or control groups.CAFs autophagy promoted the EMT process in TNBC cellsWestern blot assay indicated vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels were upregulated and E-cadherin protein level was downregulated in BT-549 when the cells were co-cultured with CAFs-CM, compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed when CAFs were previously cultured with 3-MA for 24 h (Figure 5A). Further study showed \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2, which are key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, were upregulated in the CAFs-CM group compared with the control group (P<0.05). This effect was reversed by 3-MA (Figure 5A). For MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, the same phenomenon was also observed (Figure 5B, 5C). The results demonstrate that CAFs autophagy can promote TNBC cells to engage in the EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway.DiscussionAutophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal process whereby cytoplasmic organelles and macromolecules are enveloped in autophagosomes and degraded by fusion with lysosomes for energy recycling. Recent studies show the contradictory roles of autophagy for tumor cells, which means autophagy not only facilitates cell survival and delays apoptotic death under stress, but also promotes a specific form of cell death called autophagic cell death. The same effects of autophagy on breast cancer cells can also be found in the literature, so whether autophagy promotes or protects breast cancer cells from death depends on various conditions. In a previous study by our team, we demonstrated that elevated autophagic level play a double role in TNBC BT-549 and MDA-MB-231 cell growth in vitro. However, as TNBC cells are not isolated in vivo, but are living in TME, TNBC cells have numerous connections with other cytokines and cells. Among these cells, fibroblasts are thought to be important as they are the most abundant cellular components in TME and they can transform into CAFs when activated by tumor cells. Because autophagy is conservative for most cells and CAFs is a key regulator of paracrine signaling required for cancer progression, autophagic characteristics of CAFs and effects on TNBC cells growth were evaluated in this study.As \u03b1-SMA is a marker of CAFs and its expression is higher than NFs derived from normal breast tissues, CAFs obtained from TNBC tumors were identified by \u03b1-SMA expression in our study. CAFs autophagic level was detected, showing that Beclin 1 and LC3-II/I protein conversion levels were upregulated and P62 level was downregulated, indicating that the CAFs autophagic level was higher than that of NFs for TNBC tumors. However, as CAFs were harvested from 5 patients in our study, whether CAFs autophagic level is higher than NFs for all TNBC patients needs to be further evaluated. We also found CAFs autophagy improves migration, invasion, and proliferation of TNBC cells, demonstrating the promoting effect of CAFs autophagy on TNBC cells metastasis. Because autophagy is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d for cell growth, CAFs autophagy might have a negative effect on TNBC cells growth, which depends on the tumor microenvironment.The activation of CAFs is a key event in tumor metastasis, but the exact mechanisms of metastasis caused by CAFs in breast cancer vary. For example, one study demonstrated that CAFs enhanced metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through EMT process induced by paracrine TGF-b signaling. Another study indicated that CAFs synthesized ECM, which is a mediator of invasion and migration of cancer cells with EMT phenotype, promoting cancer cells metastasis. Yet another study showed that CAFs can promote aggressive behavior of TNBC cells by inducing EMT in a CXCL12/SDF-1-dependent manner. From these results, we know that the EMT process is an important mechanism for tumor cell metastasis caused by CAFs. Because we already proved that a higher autophagic level improves the EMT process in TNBC cells through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, we also hoped to find whether there is a relationship between CAFs autophagy and TNBC cells EMT process. The present study shows that CAFs autophagy enhances the EMT process for TNBC cells by leading to upregulation of vimentin and N-cadherin protein levels, and by downregulation of E-cadherin. Further analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin and P-GSK-3\u03b2 protein levels in TNBC cells were also upregulated, indicating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway might be induced by CAFs autophagy. In fact, the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is just one type of mechanisms for tumor progression, and there are various mechanisms induced by CAFs autophagy in breast cancer. For example, TGF-\u03b21 induced an upregulation of \u03b1-SMA in CAFs and protected breast cancer cells from nutrient deprivation; BRCA1 gene knocked-down CAFs demonstrated an increase in markers of autophagy and increased ketone body production, promoting MDA-MB-231 cells progression. From these results, we know that when tumor cells are in starvation or in other stress conditions, CAFs autophagy can provide nutrition for tumor cells by paracrine signal pathways, by which tumor cells can survive in such conditions. However, most of these results came from in vitro experiments; in vivo research on TME would be more complicated and uncontrollable, so more signal pathways might be found in TNBC cells induced by CAFs.ConclusionsWe obtained CAFs from TNBC tumors and found that CAFs autophagic levels were higher than in NFs. We found that CAFs autophagy enhanced the migration, invasion, proliferation, and EMT process of TNBC cell lines, and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be a mechanism induced by CAFs autophagy for EMT process of TNBC cells.Competing interestsThere are no conflicts of interest.Source of support: This study was supported by a grant from the Youth Cultivation Foundation of Southern Medical University (No. PY2014N062)ReferencesGlobal cancer statisticsTriple-negative breast cancerIniparib plus chemotherapy in metastatic triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy inhibition re-sensitizes pulse stimulation-selected paclitaxel-resistant triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosisMiR-940 inhibited cell growth and migration in triple-negative breast cancerTriple-negative breast cancer: Therapeutic optionsResponse and resistance to BET bromodomain inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancerXBP1 promotes triple-negative breast cancer by controlling the HIF1alpha pathwayCDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction in triple-negative breast cancerImpact of tumor microenvironment and epithelial phenotypes on metabolism in breast cancerAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentCancer-associated fibroblasts from invasive breast cancer have an attenuated capacity to secrete collagensCancer associated fibroblasts have phenotypic and functional characteristics similar to the fibrocytes that represent a novel MDSC subsetIdentification of cancer-associated fibroblasts in circulating blood from patients with metastatic breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts induce high mobility group box 1 and contribute to resistance to doxorubicin in breast cancer cellsCancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells through paracrine TGF-beta signallingStromal cells in tumor microenvironment and breast cancerBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsInduction of autophagy and inhibition of tumorigenesis by Beclin 1Autophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerAutophagy protects ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts against oxidative stressAutophagy is involved in TGF-beta1-induced protective mechanisms and formation of cancer-associated fibroblasts phenotype in tumor microenvironmentThe autophagy inhibitor chloroquine targets cancer stem cells in triple negative breast cancer by inducing mitochondrial damage and impairing DNA break repairApogossypolone induces autophagy and apoptosis in breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and in vivoTargeting the prodeath and prosurvival functions of autophagy as novel therapeutic strategies in cancerEnhanced autophagy reveals vulnerability of P-gp mediated epirubicin resistance in triple negative breast cancer cellsPolyphenol-rich extract of Pimenta dioica berries (Allspice) kills breast cancer cells by autophagy and delays growth of triple negative breast cancer in athymic miceAutophagic regulation of cell growth by altered expression of Beclin 1 in triple-negative breast cancerStromal miR-200s contribute to breast cancer cell invasion through CAF activation and ECM remodelingOxidized ATM promotes abnormal proliferation of breast CAFs through maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis and activating the PI3K-AKT, MEK-ERK, and Wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathwaysMesenchymal stroma: Primary determinant and therapeutic target for epithelial cancerp16(INK4A) represses the paracrine tumor-promoting effects of breast stromal fibroblastsMetabolic reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by TGF-beta drives tumor growth: connecting TGF-beta signaling with \u201cWarburg-like\u201d cancer metabolism and L-lactate productionDownregulation of stromal BRCA1 drives breast cancer tumor growth via upregulation of HIF-1alpha, autophagy and ketone body productionAnti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer is induced by the tumor microenvironment and can be overcome by inhibiting mitochondrial function in epithelial cancer cellsGPER in CAFs regulates hypoxia-driven breast cancer invasion in a CTGF-dependent mannerCatabolic cancer-associated fibroblasts transfer energy and biomass to anabolic cancer cells, fueling tumor growthCAFs identification by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.

Its major role in a multitude of degenerative diseases such as autoimmune diseases, gastric inflammation, and several cancers, such as gastric, lung, breast and colon cancer, has resulted in the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors targeting COX-2. However the side effects of these agents have diminished the prospects of their use in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, COX-2 remains one of the most important targets in cancer, especially for cancers that are COX-2-dependent. The promise of molecular agents such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), that are more specific than pharmacological interventions, provides renewed hope for exploiting this target.In breast cancer, several studies have highlighted the importance of COX-2 in tumor development, progression, invasion, and metastasis. Uncovering mechanisms by which COX-2 regulates these processes can provide new insights and identify novel targets. In a study of 127 patients, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was found to be an independent predictor for COX-2 overexpression. Silencing COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 metastatic TNBC cells inhibited tumor onset and growth in an orthotopic xenograft model, and inhibited pulmonary colonization in an experimental model of metastasis. These changes were attributed to reduced invasiveness, reduced angiogenic capabilities, and reduced expression of pro-metastatic components of the extracellular matrix (ECM). COX-2 inhibition has been found to significantly reduce the expression of degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and alter the expression of ECM components such as hyaluronan and lumican that play a role in intra-fibrillar collagen spacing. The role of prostaglandins produced by COX-2 in promoting cancer cell adhesion in the ECM has been extensively reviewed.More recently, COX-2 has been investigated within the context of ECM modification. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 was found to reduce collagen deposition and tumor growth in the MMTV-PyMT or MMTV-PyMT/Col1a1 mouse models, and invasion during mammary gland involution. The alignment of collagen fibers perpendicularly to the tumor boundary was also associated with decreased disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. The role of COX-2 mediated collagen deposition and remodeling in breast cancer metastasis is also being actively investigated. A high density of collagen 1 (Col1) fibers in the tumor ECM has been identified as a predictor of increased metastasis.Here we investigated the role of COX-2 expression by TNBC cells in shaping the structure and function of the tumor ECM. Studies were performed in triple negative MDA-MB-231 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 downregulated by stable expression of COX-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and in triple negative SUM-149 tumors derived from cells with COX-2 overexpressed following lentiviral transduction. These tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, vascular parameters, and macromolecular transport, using MRI, and Col1 fiber distribution, using second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscopy. We investigated the ability of these cells to spontaneously metastasize to the lymph nodes and to establish metastatic nodules in lungs in an experimental model of metastasis. Col1 fiber patterns in the lung nodules were characterized. While cancer cells shape Col1 fiber patterns through the secretion of various enzymes, Col1 fiber is primarily synthesized by activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor. We therefore quantified the number of activated CAFs in the tumors using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA).We identified significant differences in vascular permeability and macromolecular transport in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors together with a significant decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that explained the decrease of vascular permeability detected with MRI. Sparser Col1 fibers were evident with COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors together with fewer and smaller metastatic nodules. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules contained fewer CAFs.COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 tumors displayed increased Col1 fiber density with a higher number of CAFs. These data expand upon the role of COX-2 in modifying the structure and function of the ECM, and identify the potential role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts in the tumor.RESULTSCOX-2 levels were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 Clone 13 cells; these cells could only be moderately induced to express COX-2 with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Figure 1A), and secrete the COX-2 product prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) following induction with TPA (Figure 1B). Injection of COX-2-reduced Clone 13 cells with Matrigel in the mammary fat pad gave rise to tumors with significantly delayed onset as shown in growth curves (Figure 1C) that correlated well with shRNA-mediated reduction of COX-2 and COX-2-catalyzed PGE2 formation. The decrease in COX-2 expression in tumors derived from Clone 13 cells were confirmed from protein expression (Figure 1D) and mRNA levels (Figure 1E).A. COX-2 expression in cells. B.

This allowed us to derive macromolecular transport parameters as well as evaluate the permeability of the tumor vasculature to this contrast agent. Representative MR derived images of permeability (Figure 2A, top), influx rate (Figure 2A, middle) and efflux rate (Figure 2A, bottom) show the effect of COX-2 reduction on permeability and macromolecular transport. Quantification of these parameters is shown in Figure 2B for permeability (top), influx rate (middle) and efflux rate (bottom). Permeability and macromolecular transport were significantly lower in COX-2 downregulated Clone 13 tumors. The scale in the efflux rate panel is inverted with cooler colors reflecting faster draining of the contrast agent. A significant decrease of VEGF protein (Figure 2C) and mRNA (Figure 2D) was observed in Clone 13 tumors.A.

Representative images of Col1 fibers from a z-stack are displayed in Figure 3A that demonstrate the reduced Col1 fiber content in Clone 13 tumors compared to MDA-MB-231 tumors.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with COX-2 reduced Clone 13 (N=3) cells had significantly larger inter-fiber distance (p-value = 0.053) and significantly lower percent fiber volume (p-value = 0.049) compared to COX-2 containing parental MDA-MB-231 mice (N=5). Values represent Mean \u00b1 SEM. *p \u2264 0.05. E. Representative photomicrographs of H&E stained sections of lymph nodes with cancer cells. Four of five MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes and one of four Clone 13 tumor-bearing mice had cancer cells detected in the axillary lymph nodes.Metastatic lung nodules established by Clone 13 cells had fewer Col1 fibers in the nodules compared to nodules established by COX-2 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). Quantification of inter-fiber distance and fiber volume shown in Figure 4D revealed a significant difference of both parameters in lung nodules following COX-2 reduction. To establish a relationship between COX-2 downregulation in primary tumors and lymph node metastasis, H&E stained axillary lymph node sections were analyzed for presence of cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4E, 80% of animals were positive for presence of cancer cells in axillary lymph nodes in the MDA-MB-231 tumor group compared to 20% in the Clone 13 tumor group.COX-2 downregulation decreased the presence of CAFs in primary tumors. Representative images of \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 tumors are shown in Figures 5A and 5D respectively. Magnified FOVs showing immunostained CAFs and the image segmentation used to identify the fibroblasts are presented in Figures 5B and 5C for the MDA-MB-231 tumor section, and in Figures 5E and 5F for the Clone 13 tumor section. Since smooth muscle cells also express \u03b1-SMA, vessel regions were excluded in the analysis. Quantification of immunostaining identified higher CAFs in MDA-MB-231 tumors compared to Clone 13 tumors, as shown in Figure 5G.

Lung nodules obtained from mice injected with MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in the tail vein revealed a significant correlation between nodule size and the number of CAFs. A significant correlation was observed between the sum of metastatic nodule pixels (reflecting total nodule area) and the sum of strongly positive pixels (reflecting number of CAFs) in lungs obtained from each mouse (Figure 6E), supporting the role of CAFs in the formation of metastasis.Representative 5 \u03bcm-thick H&E and corresponding \u03b1-SMA immunostained sections obtained from lungs of mice injected with A, B.

Empty vector transduced SUM-149 cells (SUM-149-EV) were used for comparison. Higher basal and TPA-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression were confirmed in these cells (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B). To evaluate the functionality of overexpressed COX-2 in the cells we measured secreted PGE2 levels and observed significantly higher basal and TPA-induced PGE2 secretion in these cells (Figure 7A). Tumors derived from these cells also expressed increased mRNA transcript and expressed higher COX-2 protein (Supplementary Figures 1C and 1D).A.

Representative high-resolution 20X images of lung showing pulmonary metastatic foci following intravenous injection of SUM-149-EV cells (left) and SUM-149-COX-2FL (right).To further validate the role of COX-2 expression in modifying the ECM, SHG microscopy was performed on sections obtained from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cell derived tumors. Denser Col1 fibers were observed in SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections compared to SUM-149-EV tumor sections as shown in the representative Col1 fiber images in Figure 7B. Quantification of fiber volume and inter-fiber distance confirmed a significant increase of fiber volume and a significant decrease of inter-fiber distance with COX-2 overexpression (Figure 7C).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 tumors increased the number of CAFs detected in the tumors as shown in the representative images obtained at 1X and 20X from SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL tumor sections stained for \u03b1-SMA (Figure 7D). This increase was confirmed following quantification of immunostained sections (Figure 7E). To further understand the role of COX-2 on changes in Col1 fiber content, human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were exposed to PGE2 and Col1A1 expression levels were determined. Exposure to PGE2 resulted in increased Col1A1 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).COX-2 overexpression in SUM-149 cells did not significantly increase spontaneous metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes (data not shown). Both SUM-149-EV and SUM-149-COX-2FL cells formed emboli in the vasculature, and pulmonary metastasis. COX-2 overexpression did not increase the size of the emboli or pulmonary metastasis, following intravenous injection of the cells (Figures 7F and 7G). COX-2 overexpression did, however, significantly increase (p<0.05) the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Mean \u00b1 SEM values of the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules established by SUM-149-COX-2FL cells was 5.4\u00b11.56, n=5, versus 2\u00b10.83, n=5, established by SUM-149-EV cells.DISCUSSIONHere we have shown that downregulating COX-2 expression significantly impacted ECM structure, by reducing Col1 fiber volume, and ECM function, by altering permeability and macromolecular transport, in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Decrease of VEGF was identified as a mechanism by which vascular permeability decreased. COX-2 downregulation reduced the ability of these TNBC cells to form metastatic lung nodules and to metastasize to lymph nodes. Additionally, a significant decrease of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic lung nodules established by COX-2 downregulated cells. To identify the cause of Col1 fiber reduction, we determined the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. Consistent with the decrease of Col1 fibers, a significant reduction of CAFs was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors with a similar trend in metastatic nodules. A significant correlation was observed between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs, identifying the importance of activated fibroblasts in the formation of metastasis, and the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts.Downregulating COX-2 resulted in a significant delay of tumor onset of several days as well as slower growth. Although significant, the delay was not as profound as the delay of several weeks observed when COX-2 was completely silenced further confirming the critical dependence of tumors on the prostaglandins produced by the enzyme for growth and progression.Prostanoids produced by COX-2 such as PGE2 have been observed to mediate changes in angiogenesis, and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to have an antiangiogenic effect. Silencing of COX-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells downregulated several angiogenesis related transcripts. COX-2-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells failed to promote the characteristic self-association patterns of endothelial cells in a co-culture model. Here, a significant decrease of permeability and VEGF was observed in COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors. PGE2 is a major regulator of vascular permeability, and the decrease of vascular permeability is consistent with the decrease of PGE2 and VEGF production observed in these tumors. Interestingly, macromolecular transport through the ECM was also significantly reduced with COX-2 downregulation, indicating functional modulation of the ECM by COX-2.Previous studies have shown a marked alteration of the degradome and invasion associated transcripts, including a several fold down regulation of MMP1, following COX-2 silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells. Here, COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells showed a marked decrease in the ability to invade and colonize the lungs. Colonization of lymph nodes was also attenuated. These data further support the use of COX-2 inhibition to attenuate the metastatic cascade for those tumors that are COX-2 dependent.We observed that the COX-2 downregulated MDA-MB-231 tumors had significantly sparser Col1 fiber distribution. These data further confirm earlier observations that COX-2 pharmacological inhibition reduces collagen deposition during mammary gland involution. Col1 fiber density and orientation are increasingly being linked to breast cancer metastasis and increased collagen content may contribute to the negative prognostic value of COX-2 expression in breast cancer patients. Col1 fibers were identified as channels that facilitate the ameboid movement of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Reduced Col1 fibers have been previously associated with decreased macromolecular transport, and the reduced Col1 fibers in COX-2 downregulated tumors may have altered macromolecular transport in these tumors. Reduction of Col1 fibers was observed in metastatic nodules established by Clone 13 cancer cells following intravenous injection, suggesting that Col1 fibers are also important in the establishment of metastasis following extravasation.Further confirmation of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM was evident from the significantly increased Col1 fiber density and volume observed in tumors derived from COX-2 overexpressing SUM-149 cells. COX-2 overexpression resulted in a significant increase of the number of pulmonary metastases, further supporting the role of COX-2 in establishing metastasis.We used the expression of \u03b1-SMA to detect CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic lung nodules. CAFs are a major source of Col1 fibers in the tumor stroma and contribute to the reactive desmoplastic tumor stroma. CAFs play an active role in breast cancer metastasis. Here, for the first time, we observed that COX-2 downregulation in TNBC cells resulted in a significant decrease of CAFs in primary tumors derived from these cells, and in metastatic lung nodules. Conversely, COX-2 overexpression resulted in an increase of CAFs in primary SUM-149 tumors derived from these cells. The COX-2 dependent increase or decrease of CAF numbers may primarily explain the decrease in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 downregulation and the increase in Col1 fiber content with COX-2 overexpression. These data are consistent with a significant reduction of Col1 fibers observed following treatment of tumors with the antifibrotic agent Pirfenidone that eliminated CAFs. PGE2 formed by COX-2 also increased Col1A1 expression in HMFs, although opposing effects have also been observed depending upon the type of fibroblast investigated.Our studies were performed with TNBC cells, but future studies with ER/PR/HER2 positive breast cancer cells should further expand our understanding of the role of COX-2 in modifying the ECM and CAF numbers.The role of CAFs in the establishment of metastasis was evident from the strong correlation between the size of the nodule and the number of CAFs present in the nodule. These results are also consistent with recent studies identifying the symbiosis between cancer cells and CAFs in tumor progression. In addition to identifying the role of COX-2 in activating fibroblasts, our data suggest that including CAF immunostaining of breast cancer specimens may assist in identifying more aggressive cancers. The data also support disrupting cancer cell-fibroblast interactions as a strategy to arrest tumor growth and metastatic dissemination.Collectively these data expand our insights into the role of COX-2 in breast cancer and its impact on the structure and function of the ECM. These insights are important as changes in the ECM and CAFs may occur during the course of treatments that upregulate COX-2. Our data identify a close dependence between COX-2 expression and the number of CAFs in primary tumors and metastatic nodules, and identify cancer-cell fibroblast signaling disruption as a potential treatment strategy to prevent metastatic dissemination.MATERIALS AND METHODSStable expression of the COX-2 shRNA-containing plasmid in MDA-MB-231 cellsMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The COX-2 shRNA-coding plasmid was constructed and placed under the control of the U6 promoter as previously described. Individual clones were selected for G418 resistance and analyzed for PGE2 production from the supernatant using the PGE2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Kit-Monoclonal as described by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were induced for COX-2 expression by exposure to 50 nM TPA for twenty-four hours. Clone 13 cells were selected based on their significantly reduced basal and inducible COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.Overexpression of COX-2 in SUM-149 breast cancer cellsSUM-149 breast cancer cells were obtained from Asterand (Asterand, Inc., Detroit, MI) and maintained in Ham's F12 medium (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) with 5% calf serum, insulin (5 \u03bcg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 \u03bcg/ml). An ~1.8Kb region of the coding sequence of the human COX-2 gene (NM_000963.3) was PCR amplified and cloned into the PCR2.1 Topo vector (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and later subcloned between Xho1 and Kpn1 restriction sites in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of a pHAGE-pGK-MCS-Gtx-GFP lentivirus vector. 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were co-transfected with the pHAGE-COX-2FL-Gtx-GFP plasmid, the \u0394R8.2- packaging plasmid, and a plasmid expressing vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) to produce virions. Supernatant containing virions was added to SUM-149 breast cancer cells to derive cells stably expressing the COX-2 gene (SUM-149-COX-2FL). An empty vector without the gene was used to derive control cells (SUM-149-EV). Stable increase of COX-2 expression was verified by PCR and western blot analysis.Effect of PGE2 on Col1A1 expression in HMFsHMFs kindly provided by Dr. Gary Luker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (SIGMA, St. Louis, MO). For Col1A1 protein expression, HMFs were seeded in three 100mm dishes at 1.3\u00d7106 cells per dish. Once the cells attached to the dish, cells were serum starved for twenty-four hours. At the end of serum starvation, PGE2 was added to two dishes at 3 ng/ml or 30 ng/ml in serum-free DMEM for an additional forty-eight hours. Untreated and PGE2 treated cells were analyzed for Col1A1 expression.Protein and mRNA expressionExpression levels of COX-2, \u03b1-SMA, Col1A1, and VEGF were determined by immunoblotting after blocking with 5% nonfat milk, with goat anti-COX-2 antibody (1:500, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), a monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-SMA (Clone 1A4, 1:1000), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Col1A1 (ORIGENE, Rockville, MD), or an anti-VEGF polyclonal antibody (1:2000, Millipore Temecula, CA), and visualized with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (1:50,000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as loading control.Total RNA was isolated from cells and tumor samples using the QIAshredder and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was prepared using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). cDNA samples were diluted 1:10 and real-time PCR was performed using IQ SYBR Green supermix and gene specific primers in the iCycler real-time PCR detection system (Quanta Bioscience, Gaithersburg, MD). All primers were designed using Beacon designer software 7.8 (PREMIER Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA). The expression of target RNA relative to the housekeeping gene HPRT1 was calculated based on the threshold cycle (Ct) as R = 2-\u0394(\u0394Ct), where \u0394Ct= Ct of target - Ct of HPRT1.Tumor studiesTumors derived from parent MDA-MB-231 and Clone 13 cells, with lower basal and inducible COX-2 expression levels and SUM-149 cells expressing an empty vector (SUM-149-EV) or overexpressing COX-2 (SUM-149-COX-2FL) were studied in vivo. Approximately 2-3 \u00d7 106 cancer cells in 0.05 ml of Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were inoculated in the mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Growth curves were obtained using cells inoculated in 0.05 ml of Matrigel solution (8.8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich). Orthotopic tumors were used to investigate the relationship between COX-2 expression, macromolecular transport using MRI and Col1 fiber density and volume using SHG microscopy. Lymph nodes excised from euthanized tumor-bearing mice were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 \u03bcm thickness, and stained with H&E to evaluate for spontaneous metastasis. Separate sets of mice were injected intravenously with 106 MDA-MB-231 or Clone 13 cells in 0.05 ml of HBSS. Tail vein injected mice were euthanized eight weeks later and metastatic burden and Col1 fibers in the metastatic nodules were evaluated from 0.5% agarose infused lungs that were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned.All surgical procedures and animal handling were in accordance with protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.MRIMice were imaged once tumor volumes were approximately 400-500 mm3. Mice were anesthetized, and a home-built catheter was inserted in the tail vein to inject the macromolecular contrast agent, albumin-gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (albumin-GdDTPA). MRI was performed on a 4.7 T Bruker spectrometer using a home built solenoid coil placed around the tumor. The respiration rate was monitored, and an isoflurane mask was used to maintain stable anesthesia during the 140 min of MRI scan time. The MRI acquisition was performed on volume-matched tumors as previously described. Briefly, multi-slice relaxation rates (T1-1) were acquired using a saturation recovery technique with fast-T1 SNAPSHOT FLASH imaging (flip angle = 10 degrees, echo time = 2 ms). At the end of the MRI acquisition, blood T1 was determined from 20 microliters drawn from the tail vein. Images of the central 4 slices (slice thickness of 1 mm) of the tumor were acquired (128 \u00d7 128 matrix, 16 mm field of view, number of average = 8) for three relaxation delays (100, 500 and 1000 ms). A multislice map of completely relaxed magnetization (M0 map) was also acquired with a recovery time of seven seconds. The in-plane resolution of the MR images was 125 \u03bcm x 125 \u03bcm. Macromolecular transport parameters were measured from quantitative T1 maps obtained before and following intravenous administration of albumin-GdDTPA (500 mg/kg dose). Images were acquired in two \u201cphases\u201d. The \u201cearly phase\u201d acquisition images included a pre-contrast image, and a 3-minute post-contrast image that was repeated every 5 minutes over the initial 30 minutes to characterize the tumor vascular volume and permeability surface area product. A second block of MR data, acquired up to 140 minutes post-contrast, was used to characterize the macromolecular transport parameters through the ECM. These transport parameters included the number of draining and pooling voxels, draining and pooling rates, and exudate volumes, derived as previously described. A draining voxel was defined as a voxel in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate lower than the permeability surface area product (PS), and a pooling voxel was one in which the contrast agent accumulated at a rate higher than the PS. After identifying the draining and pooling voxels, the influx and efflux rates were calculated. All quantification analysis was done in a home-built program written in IDL (ITT Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Herndon, VA) and AFNI (NIH software).MicroscopyMultiphoton microscopy was used to detect the SHG signal from Col1 fibers in 1 mm thick fresh tissue slices. SHG imaging was performed as previously described. Briefly, we used a 25\u00d7/0.8 LD LCI PlanApo multi-immersion lens on a Zeiss 710 LSM NLO Meta multiphoton microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc, Thornwood, NY). 3-dimensional (3D) image stacks were acquired from at least 10 randomly selected fields of view (FOVs) for each tumor. Following optical imaging, 5 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections were obtained from the optical slice and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody as detailed in the immunostaining section.Inflated lungs from mice in the experimental metastasis study were fixed with formalin. Five \u03bcm thick sections were obtained and stained with H&E or with anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody. Multiphoton microscopy was used to detect SHG signal from Col1 fibers in the H&E sections of the lungs from at least five randomly selected FOVs from each lung, using an Olympus Laser Scanning FV1000MPE multiphoton microscopy (Olympus Corp., Center Valley, PA) with a 25Xw/1.05XLPLN MP lens.Col1 fiber distribution analysis was performed as previously described by quantifying inter-fiber distance and percent fiber volume using a customized program written in Matlab (MATLAB 7.4.0, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).Metastatic burden was calculated as [(Total area of metastatic foci in \u03bcm2)/(Total lung area in \u03bcm2)]x100 from high-resolution digital scans of the H&E sections obtained using ScanScope (Aperio, Vista, CA). Images were processed with ImageScope software (Aperio). Col1 fiber distribution in these sections was performed as described earlier using SHG microscopy data acquired from size-matched metastatic lung nodules to avoid nodule size bias.Fibroblast immunostainingImmunohistochemistry of tumor sections was performed using the streptavidin\u2013peroxidase technique and the DAKO EnVision System (Dako Cytomation, Hamburg, Germany) as previously described using the alkaline conjugated monoclonal anti-\u03b1-SMA antibody (clone 1A4) primary antibody (Sigma; 1:200 dilution, 4\u00b0C overnight).High-resolution digital scans of the immunostained sections were obtained using ScanScope (Aperio). Images were processed and nuclei and membrane intensity quantified with ImageScope software using the algorithm supplied by the manufacturer (Aperio). The number of CAFs was quantified by computing the fraction of intensely stained pixels in the FOVs. Intensities from vessel regions were excluded for quantification.Statistical analysisStatistical significance was determined using an unpaired Students t-test performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). P values \u2264 0.05 were considered significant unless otherwise stated. To determine if the total metastatic nodule area was associated with strong \u03b1-SMA expression, i.e. the number of activated fibroblasts, we computed the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between these data for both tumor types.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTNone.FUNDINGThis work was supported by NIH R01CA82337, P50CA103175, R01CA136576, R01CA138515, R01CA73850, and P30CA006973.Author's contributionsBK, IS, SK, MFP, DJ, MS, AP and ZMB participated in the experimental design, imaging, and analysis of the data.

        "content": "The effects of 1\u03b1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) on breast carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are still unknown. This study aimed to identify genes whose expression was altered after 1,25D treatment in CAFs and matched adjacent normal mammary associated fibroblasts (NAFs). CAFs and NAFs (from 5 patients) were cultured with or without (control) 1,25D 100 nM. Both CAF and NAF expressed vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1,25D induction of the genomic pathway was detected through up-regulation of the target gene CYP24A1. Microarray analysis showed that despite presenting 50% of overlapping genes, CAFs and NAFs exhibited distinct transcriptional profiles after 1,25D treatment (FDR&lt;0.05). Functional analysis revealed that in CAFs, genes associated with proliferation (NRG1, WNT5A, PDGFC) were down regulated and those involved in immune modulation (NFKBIA, TREM-1) were up regulated, consistent with anti tumor activities of 1,25D in breast cancer. In NAFs, a distinct subset of genes was induced by 1,25D, involved in anti apoptosis, detoxification, antibacterial defense system and protection against oxidative stress, which may limit carcinogenesis. Co-expression network and interactome analysis of genes commonly regulated by 1,25D in NAFs and CAFs revealed differences in their co-expression values, suggesting that 1,25D effects in NAFs are distinct from those triggered in CAFs.",

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an important histological subtype of breast cancer. Abnormal GPER expression has been reported in human breast cancer. However, the functional mechanism of GPER through carcinoma-associated fibroblast (CAF) in TNBC needed further investigations. The proliferation and cycle progression of the MDA-MB-231 cells were respectively analyzed by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, while cell migration and invasion were examined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. GPER expression in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells was investigated by RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Collagen-1 was measured using ELISA. In addition, the role of GPER through CAF was investigated through cells were transfected with GPER interference plasmid and treated with GPER agonist, respectively. The transfection effects were verified by RT-qPCR. The results demonstrated that CAF could promote proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells compared with normal fibroblast (NF). GPER expression was decreased in TNBC tissues and MDA-MB-231 cells in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues and MCF-10A cells. GPER expression could affect the expression of <iColl-1</i in CAF. Downregulation of GPER inhibited <iColl-1</i expression in CAF, thereby inducing the decrease of cell proliferation, arrest of S phase and suppression of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, while GPER agonist could be resulted in the opposite effects. In conclusion, the present data demonstrated that GPER promoted proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells through CAF. Furthermore, GPER expression was positively related to the prognosis of TNBC.",

TNBC tends to more frequently affect younger patients. TNBC has more aggressive biological behaviours and poorer long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. The risk of distant recurrence peaks at ~3 years. Furthermore, the average survival in metastatic TNBC is 12 months, and the majority of women with metastatic TNBC will ultimately die of the disease despite treatment. The therapeutic strategy for breast cancer is largely based on the tumoral expression of three cell surface markers. In the absence of approved targeted therapies, radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy remain the mainstay treatments with suboptimal outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for the exploration of novel approaches for TNBC treatment.The extracellular matrix (ECM), as a crucial component of the tumour microenvironment, provides mechanical support for cell growth, survival and migration, and plays a key role in cancer cell malignancy. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a member of the leucine-rich repeat superfamily, which is involved in cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, including adhesion and receptor-ligand binding. It is expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and stromal cells in various types of solid tumours, such as breast cancer, as well as directly in cancer cells in tumours of mesenchymal origin, such as sarcomas. High LRRC15 expression is significantly associated with worse metastasis-free survival in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. LRRC15 is one of the genes known to be associated with breast cancer invasion. However, the effect of CAF-derived LRRCC5 on the migratory and invasive abilities of TNBC cells remains unclear.A variety of studies have evaluated the associations between several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-2, MMP-7 and MMP-9, and breast cancer cell metastasis. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of the Wnt signalling pathway, is phosphorylated by the GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognised by \u03b2-transducin repeats-containing proteins (\u03b2-TrCP1). CAFs activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells.In the present study, the role of LRRC15 in TNBC was explored. The aim of this study was to identify the combined role of LRRC15 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in the development of TNBC.Materials and methodsCell cultureCAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from the TNBC and adjacent normal tissues of three female patients (age, 41\u201359 years) undergoing surgery at Dongying People's Hospital (Dongying, China) between April 2017 and March 2019. The adjacent tissues were >2 cm away from the cancer tissue. The patients were women who were diagnosed as TNBC. Those who had received preoperative radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded. The experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Dongying People's Hospital (approval no. DYYX-2020-023). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The TNBC and adjacent tissues were cut into small pieces and placed in 0.1% type I liberase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for enzymolysis at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. The digested cell mixture was filtered through a cell strainer (Corning, Inc.) and then centrifuged at 198 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The supernatant containing the fibroblasts was further centrifuged at 198 g for 9 min at 4\u00b0C. NFs and CAFs were identified in the presence of CAF-specific markers [\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA)]. The final pellet was resuspended in DMEM/F12 (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) containing 20% foetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone; Cytiva), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.Construction of LRRC15 overexpression and knockdown fibroblastsThe CAFs were seeded in a six-well plate until they reached 80% confluence. LRRC15-targeting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids were designed and synthesised by Guangzhou RiboBio Co., Ltd. The sequences of the siRNAs are listed in Table SI. CAFs cells (1.5\u00d7106 cells/ml) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 45 nM siRNA and plasmid using Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Non-targeting siRNA (siNC) and empty vector were used as negative controls. After 48 h, the CAFs transfected with the pcDNA3.1-LRRC15 plasmids or LRRC15-targeting siRNA (siLRRC15) were used to treat TNBC MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Migration and invasion assayFor cell migration, 2\u00d7104 MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium were added into the upper chambers (24-well, pore size 8 \u00b5m; Corning, Inc.) and CAFs in medium containing 10% FBS were added to the bottom of the insert. After incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 25\u00b0C and stained with 0.5% crystal violet blue for 5 min at 25\u00b0C. The migrated cells were photographed and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, magnification, \u00d7100). For the cell invasion assay, Transwell filters were pre-coated with BD Matrigel at 37\u00b0C for 60 min (BD Biosciences). 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor, MedChemExpress) treated cells for 24 h at 37\u00b0C.Luciferase assayTo evaluate \u03b2-catenin/TCF-dependent transcriptional activity, luciferase reporter assay was performed. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (5\u00d7104) were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h with CAFs at a density of 70\u201380%. The cells were transfected with the \u03b2-catenin-responsive Firefly TOP-FLASH or the negative control FOP-FLASH reporter plasmids (VECT75319, Huayueyang Biotech Co., Ltd.) using FuGENE\u00ae 6 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega Corporation) 24 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's instructions. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was normalised to Firefly luciferase activity.Western blottingTotal protein was extracted using a lysis buffer. The Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Isolation Kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extraction according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein-assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 30 \u00b5g proteins (Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic proteins) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated protein bands were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (MilliporeSigma) and blocked using 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (1:1,000) against LRRC15 (cat. no. ab151482; Abcam), \u03b1-SMA (cat. no. 19245; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP2 (cat. no. ab92536; Abcam), MMP7 (cat. no. ab5706; Abcam), MMP9 (cat. no. ab38898; Abcam), \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab32572; Abcam), phosphorylated (p)-\u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37; cat. no. 2009; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-TrCP (cat. no. 4394; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Axin (cat. no. 2087; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), GSK-3\u03b2 (cat. no. 9315; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), p-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9; cat. no. 5558; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), cyclin D1 (cat. no. 2922; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (cat. no. 9402; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), \u03b2-actin (cat. no. 4970; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Histone H3 (cat. no. 4499; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing three times, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (1:5,000, cat. no. bs-40295G-HRP, Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the protein bands were visualized using an ECL Kit (Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.). Protein expression was quantified using Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc.).Bioinformatic analysisThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; ). Survival curve was generated with the R package \u2018survival\u2019 (version 3.6.1, ).Statistical analysesStatistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). All experiments were conducted three times. All continuous data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD. Data were statistically analysed using unpaired Student's t-test (two-tailed) and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance between two groups. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsHigh LRRC15 expression is associated with poor prognosis in patients with TNBCThe LRRC15 expression data of 235 patients with TNBC and 208 normal samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analysed and it was found that the TNBC tissues exhibited significantly higher LRRC15 expression compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). There was no significant difference in LRRC15 expression between the three TNM stages (Fig. 1B). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with TNBC with high LRRC15 expression had poor overall survival (OS; Fig. 1C), disease-specific survival (DSS; Fig. 1D), disease-free interval (DFI; Fig. 1E), and progression-free interval (PFI; Fig. 1F).LRRC15 induces MMPs to mediate migration and invasionThe results of western blotting indicated that the expression of LRRC15 and \u03b1-SMA was higher in the CAFs compared with NFs (Fig. 2A and B). To elucidate the mechanism by which LRRC15 regulates migration and invasion as well as its mechanism of action, LRRC15 was knocked down or overexpressed in CAFs (Fig. 2C) and it was found that LRRC15 expression was lower in siLRRC15-2 group than that in siLRRC15-1 group; therefore siLRRC15-2 was used for subsequent experiments. LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas its knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of both cell lines (Fig. 2D). In agreement with these results, the expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown, respectively, in CAFs (Fig. 2E).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels and transcriptional activityThe ratio of p-\u03b2-catenin/\u03b2-catenin was not significantly changed by LRRC15 overexpression or LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs. \u03b2-TrCP1 were increased in the MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs, whereas their levels were decreased by LRRC15 knockdown (Fig. 3A). Compared with that in the vector cells, the amount of \u03b2-catenin was increased in nuclear fractions by LRRC15 overexpression, whereas was significantly decreased in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by LRRC15 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 3B). To evaluate whether the increased nuclear \u03b2-catenin was transcriptionally active, paired TOP-Flash and FOP-Flash control luciferase reporters were used and it was found that the transactivity of \u03b2-catenin was increased upon LRRC15 overexpression, but decreased upon LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs (Fig. 3C).LRRC15 promotes \u03b2-catenin levels by downregulating the destruction complex protein Axin1LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs resulted in decreased expression of Axin1 and increased expression levels of GSK3\u03b2 and p-GSK3\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas LRRC15 knockdown in CAFs showed the opposite results (Fig. 4A). In agreement with these results, the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in both cell lines were either upregulated or downregulated by LRRC15 overexpression or knockdown in CAFs, respectively (Fig. 4B).LRRC15 induces migration and invasion via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signallingThe migratory and invasive abilities of the two cell lines were observed after the addition of 10 \u00b5mol/l XAV939 (Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway inhibitor) (Fig. 5). It was found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, whereas treatment with XAV939 reduced the migration and invasion of both cell lines compared with the LRRC15 overexpression group.DiscussionTNBC is associated with poor long-term outcomes compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Therefore, it is essential to discover effective tumour biomarkers to improve the prognosis and treatment for TNBC. LRRC15 is highly expressed in CAFs of multiple solid tumours or is directly expressed in the cancer cells of mesenchymal origin. Increased expression of LRRC15 is observed in ovarian cancer with bowel metastasis and knockdown of LRRC15 significantly inhibits tumour progression in mice. LRRC15 is also upregulated in bone-specific breast cancer metastasis. In this study, it was highly expressed in the CAFs of patients with TNBC. A previous study suggested that the overexpression of LRRC15 is positively correlated with tumour grade and is independently associated with worse metastasis-free survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcomas. The present study found that high LRRC15 expression in TNBC tissues was not associated with TNM stage, but with poor prognosis in patients with TNBC.CAFs play a central role in facilitating tumour progression and metastasis in TNBC. They are responsible for the secretion of proteins and cytokines that regulate ECM modifications, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. MMPs are zinc-containing endopeptidases that can degrade various components of ECM proteins. ECM degradation is the initial step toward tumour cell invasion. MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 have been well-studied as proteins related to TNBC cell migration and invasion. For instance, peptidyl arginine deiminase type 1 inhibition prevents metastasis and decreases MMP2/9 expression in TNBC cells. Cadherin-11 knockdown decreases \u03b2-catenin, Met, c-Myc and MMP7 expression and attenuates TNBC cell migration and invasion. Knockdown of galectin-1 in CAFs notably inhibits CAF-conditioned medium-induced cell migration and invasion, most likely by inhibiting the expression of MMP-9. Consistent with these results, the current study found that LRRC15 overexpression in CAFs induced MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells.Previous reports have shown that Wnt signalling is associated with metastasis in TNBC. Kwon et al reported that homeobox protein TGIF1 knockdown inhibits Wnt target genes and in vitro cell invasion, suggesting that TGIF1 may inhibit the invasion of TNBC cells. Silencing of paired-related homeobox 1b suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. In the present study, it was found that LRRC15 promoted the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells by regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway, and that this function of LRRC15 could be reversed by XAV939.It is well-established that endogenous \u03b2-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Additionally, abnormal activation of Wnt signalling often leads to \u03b2-catenin nuclear stabilisation and translocation and promotes cyclin D1 gene expression. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin transcriptionally activates the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor family proteins that drive tumour formation. Axin, adenomatous polyposis coli, casein kinase I\u03b1 and GSK-3\u03b2 constitute the destruction complex. \u03b2-catenin stability is controlled by the destruction complex and subsequent binding by the E3 ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP for targeted ubiquitylation and degradation. With the knockdown of small ubiquitin-like modifier specific peptidase 7 in mammary epithelial cells, the interaction between Axin1 and \u03b2-catenin ceases and \u03b2-catenin escapes ubiquitylation-dependent proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of Axin1 decreases the association of c-myc with GSK-3\u03b2. Morrow et al reported that Merlin alters the localisation of \u03b2-catenin and significantly reduces the protein levels of \u03b2-catenin by targeting it for degradation through the upregulation of Axin1. Consistent with these results, the current results demonstrated that LRRC15 promoted \u03b2-catenin expression in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions and that \u03b2-catenin could be degraded via GSK-3\u03b2-mediated phosphorylation at the residues Ser33/37.The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of LRRC15 in TNBC development, but there are limitations of this study. These findings give an idea of the expression and possible compensatory roles of other members of the LRRC family in the process of TNBC development. However, the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were only determined via western blotting. The use of zymography to assess the expression levels would have improved the methodology of this study. In addition, zymography could have been performed to assess the activation status of the enzymes. In summary, these findings showed that high LRRC15 expression was associated with poor prognosis of patients with TNBC. LRRC15 promoted cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells and played a role in the regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway.Supplementary MaterialFundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYY conceived and designed the present study, and wrote the manuscript.

In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, the signaling pathways found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs likely contribute to the enhanced migration of breast cancer cells in transwell assays and may contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of Her2+ breast cancer.ConclusionsThese data demonstrate that in addition to the distinct molecular profiles that characterize the neoplastic cells, CAF gene expression is also differentially regulated in distinct subtypes of breast cancer.BackgroundGene expression profiling of whole breast tumors has stratified breast cancer into several molecular subtypes that largely correlate with the expression status of three receptors in the tumor cells, namely estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Her2-neu (Her2) . The most common breast cancer subtype expresses either ER or PR but lacks Her2 expression. Breast cancers that do not express any of the 3 receptors, known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and those that express Her2 (Her2+) are less common, comprising approximately 15% and 25% of all breast cancers respectively. Her2+ and TNBC have less favorable prognosis compared to ER\u2009+\u2009cancers . How cancer cells acquire a specific molecular phenotype is uncertain. It has been postulated recently that the tumor stroma and the cancer cells may co-evolve to support the selection or enrichment of a specific cancer subtype .Much of the earlier gene expression profile analyses of breast cancer were performed using RNA extracted from tumor samples comprised of at least 50% of tumor cells, with the tumor stromal cells being a minor but important component. As tumor cell survival and tumor progression are dependent on the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the symbiotic relationship between neoplastic cells and stromal cells is crucial to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease . This interdependency is reinforced by the recent identification of a stroma-derived gene signature that correlates with prognosis suggesting that the tumor stroma contributes significantly to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells . A unique breast cancer stroma signature has also been observed in women of African American descent compared to European American descent , while a stromal gene signature has been reported to predict response to chemotherapy . These observations support the suggestion that intrinsic heterogeneities between the tumor stroma may correlate with patient-specific characteristics, prognosis, therapeutic response, and, perhaps, tumor subtypes. However, breast cancer subtype-specific differences have not yet been reported for the tumor stromal cells even though multiple studies have shown that the gene expression profiles of breast cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are distinctly different from their normal counterparts. None of these prior studies had stratified their results based on tumor subtypes .In this study, we isolated CAFs from twenty primary breast cancer samples representing three main subtypes (ER\u2009+\u2009(n\u2009=\u20097), TNBC (n\u2009=\u20097), Her2+ (n\u2009=\u20096)) and performed gene expression profile analyses on RNA isolated from these early passage CAFs. Subtype-specific gene expression profile differences were observed that distinguished CAFs derived from Her2+ cancers and TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009cancers. Several genes, e.g. ITGA3, ITGA5, CFL1, and RHOA, that were found to be selectively up regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ but not ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers are known to be involved with pathways associated with integrin and RhoA signaling suggesting that CAFs may contribute to the invasiveness of Her2+ breast cancer . Migration of breast cancer cells,T47D, was significantly enhanced by CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer compared with ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC. Our findings suggest that CAFs might contribute to the biology of the disease in a subtype-specific manner. Our findings are also consistent with the recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis .qRT-PCR validation. qPCR was used to validate microarray results for 6 genes found to be significantly different in either Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs TNBC or ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC comparison in microarrays data. Expression for arrays and qPCR were normalized separately over average value across absolute expression for Her2\u2009+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC groups. Error bars represent standard error of mean for the group.MethodsPatients and clinical characteristics of study cohortWomen with primary operable breast cancer undergoing breast surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were asked to participate in our tissue banking protocol approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Our study cohort included 20 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2008 and 2011. Breast tumors were stratified into three subgroups according to receptor expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as described previously : 1) ER\u2009+\u2009denotes breast cancer which expresses either ER or PR and lacks Her2 expression (n\u2009=\u20097); 2) TNBC denotes breast cancer that lacks expression of ER, PR, and Her2 (n\u2009=\u20097); and 3) Her2+ group (n\u2009=\u20096) denotes breast cancer which expresses Her2 as determined by IHC and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization with (n\u2009=\u20091) or without expression of ER or PR (n\u2009=\u20095). All data collection and analyses were adherent to Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Clinical characteristics, including age at diagnosis, race, histology, tumor size, tumor grade, and number of involved (+) axilla nodes were compared. Pair-wise comparison was done using two-tail t-test for age and tumor size, and Fisher\u2019s exact test for race (Caucasian vs. African-American), histology, tumor grade (II vs. III) and number of (+) axilla nodes (none vs. one or more).Tissue dissociation and cell cultureAfter our surgical pathologists completed gross examination and inking of the tumor specimen, fresh tumor tissue was taken from the center of the tumor without interfering with margin assessment as determined by the pathologists. The tissues were stored in ice cold medium DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin. The fresh tumor tissue was kept on ice at 4\u00b0C until ready for processing within 6\u2009hours from the excision time. If the tumor tissue weighed less than 0.5 gram (n\u2009=\u20095) (TB160 \u2013 TB165), the tissue was mechanically dissociated by mincing with scalpel and scissors to 1\u20132\u2009mm3 in a 10\u2009cm tissue culture plate. Fibroblast growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS penicillin and streptomycin) was then added. After several days, outgrowth of spindle shaped cells was observed. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed and medium changed between day 2\u20134. For tissues (n\u2009=\u200914) weighing more than 0.5 gram (TB71 - TB148) the tissue was minced as described above and then enzymatically dissociated in tissue digestion buffer containing collagenase I (Worthington), hyaluronidase (Sigma), Collagenase IV (Worthington) at 1\u2009mg/ml of each enzyme in DMEM/F12 medium in a volume of 1:5 ratio of tumor to buffer (wt/vol) on a gyrating platform at 37o C for 30\u2009min. The digestion was quenched by addition of fibroblast growth medium and filtered through a 70\u2009\u03bcm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted at 1500\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min. Tissue debris and non-adherent cells were removed during medium change between day 2 or 4. By 10 \u2013 14\u2009days, near confluent adherent spindle shaped cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin in versene, washed and replated in fresh fibroblast growth medium. Medium was changed every 4 \u2013 7\u2009days. CAFs from early passages (passage 2\u20133) were harvested and the cell pellet was stored in RNA later (Applied Biosystems) at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA was isolated.RNA purification and microarraysRNA purification was carried out using TRI Reagent\u00ae (Molecular Research Center) according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA quality was determined using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Only samples with RIN numbers\u2009>\u20097.5 were used for further studies. Equal amounts (400\u2009ng) of total RNA was amplified as recommended by Illumina and hybridized to the HumanHT-12 v4 human whole genome bead arrays. Illumina BeadStudio v.3.0 software was used to export expression levels and detect p-values for each probe of each sample. Quality control of each array was performed using median Spearman correlation computed against all other arrays. Arrays whose median correlation differed from the global correlation by more than 8 absolute deviations were marked as outliers and not used for further analysis (resulting in the removal of one TNBC sample, TB147 (Table\u2009 1)). The remaining 19 arrays were then quantile-normalized between each other and filtered to remove non-informative probes (probes with a detection p-value\u2009>\u20090.05 in all samples). Between-batch normalization was performed using Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) approach  using 4 samples replicated in the 2 microarray batches. Average expression between replicates was used for data analysis. The data was submitted to GEO database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and available by using accession number GSE37614.List of samples used in gene expression analysesSubtype\tPatient ID\tb1\tb2\tset\t \tTNBC\tTB123\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB125\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB134\tx\tx\t \tTB160\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB162\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tTB164\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB147\t\u00a0\tx\toutlier\t \tER+\tTB71\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB75\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB130\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB163\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB165\t\u00a0\tx\t \tTB98\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB120\tx\t\u00a0\t \tHer2+\tTB76\tx\t\u00a0\ttraining\t \tTB117\tx\tx\t \tTB136\tx\t\u00a0\t \tTB122\tx\tx\ttesting\t \tTB129\t\u00a0\tx\t \tHer2+/ER+\tTB148\t\u00a0\tx\ttesting\t \tList of samples divided into two batches (b1 and b2) including two samples from each subtype as an independent validation (testing) set as indicated.Flow cytometry analysis1Adherent early passage CAFs were harvested with 0.05% trypsin/versene, washed in standard FACS buf-fer containing (5 ul/test) Fc blocking antibodies as recommended by the manufacture (Biolegend), and stained with the following directly conjugated antibodies for the evaluation of surface markers by flow cytometry analyses:EpCAM: PE anti-human CD326 clone 9C4 (Biolegend) used at 1ug/ml; PE-F19: mouse anti-human FAP\u03b1 monoclonal antibody (clone F19), used at 1/10 dilution, was purified from serum-free hybridoma supernatant as described ; CD45: APC mouse anti-human CD45 (BD Pharmingen) used at 20ul/test according to manufacturer's recommendation; CD31: APC anti-human CD31 clone WM59 (eBioscience) used at 5ug/ml.Independent validationWe randomly selected two samples from each Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC subtype as an independent validation set (testing set Table\u2009 1). One sample which was unique in its subtype classification in that the CAF was derived from a Her2\u2009+ and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer (TB148, Additional file 1: Table S1) was also added to the testing set in order to show how it would be classified based only on its gene expression profile. The training set used to select the genes that distinguish the 3 CAF subtypes included 3 Her2+, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009and 4 TNBC samples was analyzed with one way ANOVA to identify a list of significant genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 used as a significance threshold. Expression patterns of the significant genes were used for Principal Component Analysis. Projection of training and testing set samples on the first two principal components was used to visualize relationship between samples.Differentially expressed genesAfter the validation, a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between three classes of samples (Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC) was determined by using one way ANOVA on the full set of samples, except for the one Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009sample (TB148). False discovery rate (FDR) was determined according to published protocol . Significance for genes between each pair of groups was determined by Tukey post-hoc test. P-value <0.05 was set as a significance threshold.Gene enrichment analysisIdentification of biological functions and pathways overrepresented in any gene list was done using DAVID  and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). DAVID results were restricted to gene ontology (GO) terms, KEGG, and BIOCARTA pathways and Swiss-Prot keyword enrichments and filtered to satisfy FDR <5% and fold enrichment >2 criteria. Significance of IPA results was defined by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for multiple testing p-value\u2009<\u20090.05.HeatmapHeatmap was generated for a list of the 44 significant genes (with a fold change\u2009>\u20092) that distinguish Her2+ CAFs from both ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Genes were hierarchically clustered using Spearman correlation distance and complete linkage. Heatmap color intensities were proportional to a value calculated as a ratio between the gene expression in a single sample and the geometric mean expression of the gene across all samples.qPCR validationExpression of six genes, ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1 and FZD1, as well as 3 endogenous controls (ec) RPL19, TBP and UBA5 were assessed by qRT-PCR in triplicates. Median Ct values for each gene were used for \u0394\u0394Ct analysis, where \u0394Ct was calculated against average Ct of the three endogenous controls and \u0394\u0394Ct calculated as difference between average \u0394Ct values of compared groups. Final fold change between a pair of groups was calculated as 2\u0394\u0394Ct. Significance of the difference between two groups was tested by two-tail t-test on \u0394Ct values. For comparison with expression values from microarrays, corrected for loading bias absolute expression values E for each gene G were calculated as follows: E\u2009=\u2009AEG/(AEec/avg(AEec)), where absolute expression AEG\u2009=\u2009240-Ct, AEec is an average AE between three endogenous controls and avg(AEec) is an average of AEec taken across all samples. Expression values were then normalized for microarray and qRT-PCR data separately over three group average absolute expression values.Transwell migration assayThe migration properties of T47D (ATCC), a breast cancer cell line, known to have low migratory properties , was evaluated in the presence or absence of CAFs derived from ER, TNBC, and Her2+ breast cancer using a transwell assay. CAFs (1\u00d7104 cells) from each of the three subtypes were seeded in 100\u2009\u03bcl of DMEM containing 1% serum medium in the lower well of a Transwell chamber (Costar, Inc.) with 8\u2009\u03bcm pore size polycarbonate filters and left to attach for 90mins. As control, medium containing no CAFs was placed in the lower well. T47D (1\u00d7104 cells) were then seeded onto the upper chamber in 1% serum medium. Transwell chambers were incubated for 48\u2009hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Membranes were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) for 15\u2009min, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, SF100-20) for 15\u2009min before imaging. The number of T47D cells that migrated onto the underside of the membrane was counted in 5 fields using a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope at 10\u00d7 magnification and plotted. Statistical evaluation was performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.)ResultsIsolation of CAFs from fresh human breast cancer samplesThe clinical characteristics of the study cohort are summarized in Table\u2009 2. Detailed clinical characteristics of each tumor are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1. No significant differences were noted among the three subgroups, except for tumor grade (Table\u2009 2). The morphology of CAFs isolated from the 3 different breast cancer subtypes was similar (Figure\u2009 1). Further phenotypic characterization using flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that >95% of these cells expressed fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a previously identified marker of cancer associated fibroblasts . Moreover, >99% of the cells were negative for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a breast cancer epithelial cell surface marker ; CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1), an endothelial cell marker, and CD45, a pan-leukocyte marker (Figure\u2009 2, lower panel). Moreover, these CAFs uniformly expressed vimentin and collagen by immunohistochemistry (data not shown).Clinical characteristics of breast cancer study cohort\u00a0\t\u00a0\tOverall\tTNBC\tER+\tHer2+\tp-values\t \tTNBC vs. ER+\tTNBC vs. Her2+\tER+ vs. Her2+\t \tn\t\u00a0\t20\t7\t7\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tAge at diagnosis mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t52 \u00b1 16\t47 \u00b1 14\t59 \u00b1 18\t49 \u00b1 16\t0.21\t0.83\t0.33\t \tEthnicity\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tCaucasian\t10\t3\t5\t2\t0.59\t1\t0.56\t \t\u00a0\tAfrican American\t9\t4\t2\t3\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tAsian\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tInvasive carcinoma histology\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tductal\t14\t7\t3\t6\t0.07\t1\t0.19\t \t\u00a0\tlobular\t6\t0\t4\t0\t \tTumor size (cm) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t4.8 \u00b1 4.2\t3.0 \u00b1 1.1\t4.9 \u00b1 2.5\t5.7 \u00b1 7.4\t0.06\t0.35\t0.81\t \tT1\t<2 cm\t4\t1\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT2\t2.1 - 5 cm\t10\t6\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tT3\t>5 cm\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tTumor grade\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tI\t0\t0\t0\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tII\t3\t1\t3\t0\t0.03\t1\t0.03\t \t\u00a0\tIII\t11\t6\t0\t4\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t6\t0\t4\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tNo. of involved axilla node(s) mean \u00b1 standard deviation\t5.5 \u00b1 7.8\t4.1 \u00b1 8.6\t6.4 \u00b1 8.4\t6.0 \u00b1 7.0\t0.10\t0.56\t0.52\t \t\u00a0\t0\t8\t5\t1\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t1-3\t4\t0\t4\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t4-9\t3\t1\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\t>9\t4\t1\t2\t2\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tnot assessed\t1\t0\t0\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tReceptor status\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tER+\t8\t0\t7\t1\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tPR+\t7\t0\t7\t0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \t\u00a0\tHer2+\t6\t0\t0\t6\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t\u00a0\t \tCAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhances the migration of T47D cells in vitro. In vitro transwell assays comparing T47D migration in the absence (orange) or presence of CAFs isolated from ER (black), Her2 (blue) and TNBC (green) primary human breast cancer tumors were performed. Each experiment was performed in duplicates using CAFs derived from at least two different patients. One CAF cell line of each subtype was tested in 2 independent experiments (open vs. closed circles). The second CAF cell line of each subtype (squares) was tested in duplicate in one independent experiment, for a total of 6 tests. Lines show mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SEM.Gene expression profile analyses of CAFs derived from TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ breast cancerRNA isolated from the early passage CAFs were assayed for gene expression and randomly assigned to two sample sets, namely, training and testing sets (Table\u2009 1) to perform independent validation. Using one-way ANOVA on the training set (4 TNBC samples, 5 ER\u2009+\u2009samples and 3 Her2+ samples)), we identified 782 genes that were differentially expressed between TNBC, ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ samples (p-value\u2009<\u20090.05). In order to visualize the relationships between the sample types, we performed unsupervised Principal Component Analysis using the 782 significant genes (Figure\u2009 2A). This type of plot reflects the similarities and differences between all samples in relation to the 782 significant genes. It should be noted that the first principal component plotted on the X axis accounts for 49% of the variation in the data and indicates that there are significant differences between the CAFs derived from the Her2+ cancers and both the TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancers, as these samples are equally separated from the Her2+ samples along the X axis. The second principal component plotted on the Y axis accounts for only 14% of the gene expression variation between all samples. It captures putative differences between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples and indicates that the expression profiles are much more similar between these two subtypes.Characterization of CAFs from breast cancer subtypes by morphology (light microscopy) and flow cytometry analysis. Top panel, 20x magnification light microscopy pictographs of a) ER+; b) TNBC and c) Her2+ breast cancer derived CAFs; Lower panel, histograms (dark solid line) depicting CAFs staining for (left to right): EpCAM, FAP, CD45, and CD31; light grey lines depict histogram of CAFs staining with isotype control antibodies.We then determined whether the training set principal components could also distinguish the new Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC patient samples thus validating our initial observations. Figure\u2009 2A shows the separation of the 12 samples representing the 3 original sample types in the training set that we used to select the significant genes that defined this separation. Figure\u2009 2 Bconfirms these genes also identify the subtype differences in new samples analyzed as an independent validation set and included two new Her2+ samples and t two new ER\u2009+\u2009and two new TNBC samples. The new Her2+ samples clearly cluster with the Her2+ samples in the training set while the new ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samples once again cluster with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC training set samples. Although the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs appear to self segregate along the 2nd principal component in the training set (Figure\u2009 2A), no significant differences in gene expression were detected between the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC CAFs in the testing set (Figure\u2009 2B). This indicates that there is a high degree of gene expression similarity in the CAFs associated with the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC cancer subtypes.It should also be noted that new sample TB148, which is both Her2+ and ER+, co-segregates with the Her2+ samples which were all ER- (Figure\u2009 2B), indicating the presence of a gene expression profile more similar to the Her2+ CAFs and not the ER\u2009+\u2009CAF sample group. This indicates a dominance of Her2+ CAF gene expression signature over ER\u2009+\u2009CAF signature.We also combined the expression data for all samples (except for the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009TB148) to take advantage of the larger sample size and ran one way ANOVA to define a final list of significant genes differentially expressed between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC in the larger data set. We found 1829 differentially expressed genes with p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 and estimated false discovery rate of 28%. When the relationships between the different CAF subtypes were reassessed using Principal Component Analysis with the new gene set, we found the same cancer subtype specific differences as demonstrated on training subset (Figure\u2009 2A).The number of significant genes identified by pair-wise comparisons (Tukey post-hoc test) between the three classes of patient samples, i.e. Her2+ vs ER+, Her2+ vs. TNBC and ER\u2009+\u2009vs TNBC samples, are presented in the Venn diagram in Figure\u2009 3. These results quantify the visual interpretation of Principal Component Analysis demonstrating that while 1,800 genes were significantly differentially expressed between Her2+ and either ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC, only 118 genes were significantly different between ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs. Further studies with increased number of samples for ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC derived CAFs will be required to identify genes that can discrimi-nate those 2 classes, if they exist. A gene expression heat map for the 44 most changed unique genes (fold change\u2009>\u20092) which were common to the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2 + vs TNBC comparisons are shown in Figure\u2009 4.Relationship between Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC classes of samples visualized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the training set samples using expression of genes differentially expressed between the three classes.

Results with DAVID software analyses  are shown in Additional file 2: Table S2 for the Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u20091253 significant genes, and in Additional file 3: Table S3 for Her2+ vs TNBC 1035 significant genes. Enrichment of nine functional categories associated with cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix were found to be significant in both comparisons.Ingenuity pathway analysis was done for a list of 615 genes common between Her2+ vs ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. A list of significantly enriched canonical pathways is presented in Table\u2009 3. Pathways involving extracellular matrix/integrin signaling were found to be significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ cancer, further supporting the DAVID results. It should be noted that 92% (61 of the 66 unique) of the genes associated with the ingenuity pathways are upregulated in Her2+ supporting the hypothesis that those pathways are more active in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer as compared to those derived from the ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancers.Canonical pathways upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC samplesEnriched ingenuity canonical pathways\tpval\t# of genes\tGenes\t \tP\tL\t\u2191\t\u2193\t\u00a0\t \tActin Cytoskeleton Signaling\t0.0002\t226\t20\t20\t0\tPFN1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, CSK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tIntegrin Signaling\t0.0008\t205\t18\t18\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, ARF1\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, VCL\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRegulation of Actin-based Motility by Rho\t0.001\t87\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ARHGDIA\u2191\t \tRac Signaling\t0.002\t117\t12\t12\t0\tRELA\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, SH3RF1\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191\t \tCdc42 Signaling\t0.003\t142\t13\t13\t0\tMPRIP\u2191, MAP3K11\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, TNK2\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, HLA-F\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, ARPC2\u2191\t \tILK Signaling\t0.005\t182\t15\t14\t1\tRELA\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, ILK\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MYC\u2193, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, TGFB1I1\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MYH9\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tRhoA Signaling\t0.006\t107\t11\t11\t0\tMYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, PFN1\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, PIP5K1C\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, MSN\u2191\t \tPI3K/AKT Signaling\t0.010\t129\t11\t10\t1\tRELA\u2191, PPP2R1A\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, YWHAH\u2191, TSC2\u2191, TYK2\u2191, ILK\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tGerm Cell-Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling\t0.010\t159\t13\t13\t0\tMAP3K11\u2191, RHOC\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, ILK\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, IQGAP1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, SORBS1\u2191, RHOA\u2191, ACTN1\u2191\t \tCardiac Hypertrophy Signaling\t0.010\t228\t16\t14\t1\tMAP3K11\u2191, CALM1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, EIF2B2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, RHOA\u2191, MAPKAPK2\u2191, HSPB1\u2191\t \tPhospholipase C Signaling\t0.01\t243\t16\t14\t0\tRELA\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, RHOC\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ARHGEF17\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tProtein Kinase A Signaling\t0.01\t306\t19\t13\t3\tRELA\u2191, YWHAH\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CALM1\u2191, PPP1R14A\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, PPP1R11\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCD3\u2193, MYL12A\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, PDE7B\u2193, FLNA\u2191, RHOA\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191, PDE6D\u2191\t \tFAK Signaling\t0.01\t98\t9\t9\t0\tCSK\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, VCL\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, TNS1\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, ACTG1\u2191\t \tfMLP Signaling in Neutrophils\t0.01\t117\t10\t6\t0\tGNB1\u2191, RELA\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, NFKBIA\u2193, CALM1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, HRAS\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, NFKBIB\u2191\t \tAxonal Guidance Signaling\t0.04\t422\t21\t21\t0\tKLC1\u2191, PFN1\u2191, GLI2\u2191, PLXNA3\u2191, MYL6\u2191, CFL1\u2191, ARPC5L\u2191, TUBB2A\u2191, HRAS\u2191, TGA5\u2191, PPP3CC\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, BCAR1\u2191, NCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, GNB1\u2191, PLCB4\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, TUBB6\u2191, ARPC2\u2191, RHOA\u2191\t \tNeuregulin Signaling\t0.04\t95\t8\t6\t2\tMYC\u2193, PICK1\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HBEGF\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, STAT5B\u2193\t \tPAK Signaling\t0.05\t104\t8\t8\t0\tNCK2\u2191, MYL9\u2191, MYL12A\u2191, CFL1\u2191, MYL6\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191\t \tVirus Entry via Endocytic Pathways\t0.05\t92\t8\t8\t0\tAP2M1\u2191, FLNA\u2191, PLCG1\u2191, ITGA5\u2191, HRAS\u2191, ITGA3\u2191, ACTG1\u2191, DNM2\u2191\t \tpval\u2009=\u2009Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value, P\u2009=\u2009total number of genes known to be involved in the pathway, L\u2009=\u2009number of genes from the pathway that were also in the list of significant genes. \u2191\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly upregulated in Her2+, \u2193\u2009=\u2009number of genes significantly downregulated in Her2+. The 18 significantly enriched pathways share 66 unique genes with 61 of those upregulated in Her2+ compared to ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC.Q-RT-PCR validation of individual gene expression data in CAFsTo confirm differential gene expression levels in the three breast cancer subtypes, Her2+, ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC, we selected 6 genes (ITGA3, ITGA5, OXTR, WNT5B, BCAR1, FZD1) with significantly different levels of expression based on our microarray studies and validated their expression levels by qRT-PCR. Fold changes in expression based on the arrays ranged from 1.5 fold to 6.9 fold. Five of the 6 genes that were found to be expressed at higher levels in the Her2+ samples were also significantly different in the Her2+/ER\u2009+\u2009qRT-PCR comparison; and 4 of those 5 genes that were significantly different in the Her2+/TNBC array comparison were also significantly different by qRT-PCR comparison (Figure\u2009 5. and Additional file 4: Table S4). Expression ratios by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with array values and overall somewhat higher by qRT-PCR as expected. One gene, FZD1, which was expressed at lower levels in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer by array analyses, was also significantly lower by qRT-PCR in the Her2/TNBC comparison but was not significantly different in the ER/TNBC comparison (P\u2009=\u20090.2) although fold change values were similar by qRT-PCR (TNBC/ER\u2009+\u2009= 1.33 for microarrays and 1.39 for qPCR).Heat map of expression for 44 genes with the greatest differences between Her2+ vs. ER\u2009+\u2009and Her2+ vs. TNBC comparisons. FC\u2009=\u2009fold change from geometrical mean of expression across all samples.Her2 CAFs enhanced the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells in vitroTo explore whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes can differentially enhance the migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells, we performed in vitro transwell assays comparing the migration of breast cancer cells cultured in the presence or absence of CAFs isolated from ER+, Her2+ and TNBC. The number of migrated T47 cells onto the membrane surface that was facing the lower chamber was counted. Results were analyzed by unpaired Kruskal-Wallis test. The level of statistical significance was taken as P\u2009<\u20090.05. As our gene expression profile results have predicted, CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer significantly enhanced the migration of T47D (Figure\u2009 6).DiscussionRobust evidence is now available that underscores the role of CAFs in tumor progression . Previous gene expression profile analyses comparing CAFs and fibroblasts derived from matched normal adjacent breast tissues have demonstrated significant differences between the CAF and their normal counterparts but, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have addressed whether CAFs derived from various breast cancer subtypes harbor subtype specific gene expression signatures. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that CAFs from several breast cancer subtypes exhibit subtype-specific gene expression profiles. Specifically, we show that the gene expression profile of CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers are significantly different from CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009or TNBC breast cancers.Heterogeneity among fibroblasts has been described in various organ sites including lung, skin, sclera and orbit . Furthermore, Sugimoto and coworkers demonstrated that the expression of various fibroblast markers are heterogeneous within the tumor stroma in mouse breast and pancreatic tumor models using immunohistochemical analyses . Several studies have generated gene expression profiles from breast cancer-associated fibroblasts but none of these studies have stratified their results based on tumor subtypes. Work by Allinen and coworkers evaluated gene expression profiles of breast cancer stromal cells which were isolated by negatively selecting out epithelial cells, lymphocytes and endothelial cells . Work described by Singer et al. compared gene expression profiles of stromal fibroblasts derived from 10 invasive breast cancers with stromal fibroblasts derived from normal breast tissues of 10 women undergoing breast reduction surgery . Their results demonstrated increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes in the pooled CAFs. Work by Bauer et al. (2010) evaluated gene expression profiles of fibroblasts derived from 6 matched breast cancers and adjacent normal breast tissues  and found distinct differences between CAFs and normal fibroblasts, specifically in genes related to paracrine or intracellular signaling, transcriptional regulation, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion/migration. However, all of the above studies were not designed to test subtype specific differences in CAFs due to these studies\u2019 relatively small sample size. In addition, when tumor subtype data were reported, the less common breast cancer subtypes, i.e., Her2+ or TNBC cancer, were underrepresented.Our results showed that CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancers significantly up-regulated pathways associated with actin cytoskeleton and integrin signaling (Table\u2009 3). Integrins mediate cell attachment with extracellular matrix (ECM) to provide traction necessary for cell motility and invasion. These upregulated signaling pathways may have contributed to the elevated migratory phenotype of breast cancer cells (T47D) in our in vitro transwell assays (Figure\u2009 1).The extracellular matrix and integrins collaborate to regulate gene expression associated with cell growth, differentiation and survival; all of which are deregulated during cancer progression and metastasis. A recent study using a three-dimensional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)/fibroblast co-culture model elegantly demonstrated the role of three genes, integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b15 and Rho, in promoting a fibroblast-led collective invasion of SCC cells into the extracellular matrix . Interestingly, all three genes were significantly up-regulated in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer with integrin signaling as the second most enriched pathway (Table\u2009 3). Moreover, many of the genes and pathways downstream of integrin signaling are also significantly upregulated in Her2+ CAFs. These include focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rac and Rho signaling pathways as well as several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), further underscoring the importance of integrin signaling in CAF. In addition to the well-established role of integrins in migration and invasion, integrins can also regulate cell proliferation, including mammary gland proliferation  through integrin-linked kinase (ILK) , which was also noted to be significantly upregulated in HER2+ derived CAFs. These characteristic differences in CAFs derived from Her2+ breast cancer may contribute to the aggressiveness of this particular breast cancer subtype which is known to have an increased propensity for local and distant recurrence . In addition, the sites of distant metastasis appear to differ according to breast cancer subtype with Her2+ breast cancer having a higher rate of brain, liver, and lung metastases than ER\u2009+\u2009breast cancer . The role of CAF in contributing to a subtype-specific trophism for the various distant metastatic sites is unknown.Gene expression profile differences between CAFs derived from ER\u2009+\u2009and TNBC breast cancer were less pronounced and we were unable to confirm them with independent validation set using the limited sample numbers (Figure\u2009 2B). While it is possible that true differences may exist among these two subtypes, a larger number of samples would be required to find those differences with an acceptable false discovery rate.ConclusionsOur results show that subtype specific changes exist in CAFs derived from breast cancer. In the case of Her2+ breast cancer, a more aggressive breast cancer subtype with known increased risk of local and distant recurrence, CAFs may augment the invasive properties of the tumor cells via pathways associated with cytoskeleton and integrin signaling. Our findings also provided molecular evidence supporting a recently proposed tumor-stroma co-evolution hypothesis which suggested that the tumor microenvironment, e.g. CAFs, may adopt specific changes to optimize the survival/propagation of a specific tumor cell type . Whether these programmatic differences in CAFs result from epigenetic changes or whether these differences are due to heterogeneity within the CAF population, i.e. proportion of resident fibroblasts vs. recruited fibroblasts, or fibroblasts derived from epithelial mesenchymal transition are unknown. In addition, whether CAFs contribute to tumor progression in a subtype specific manner is unknown. How CAFs and other components of the tumor microenvironment drive or are being driven by the tumor cells to promote the propagation and maintenance of a specific tumor subtype will be the subject of future work.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interest.Authors' contributionsJT, AVK and LS designed the study; JT, AVK, LC, CS performed the experiments described in this study; JT, AVK, LC, MH, LS and EP contributed to the writing of the manuscript.

The tumor microenvironment has been found to play a crucial role in the process of tumor metastasis, and is primarily composed of immune cells, vascular cells, fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, fat cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Among these cell types, fibroblasts can be activated to become cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are the most abundant cell type in the BC matrix, accounting for 80% of BC tissue. Via both autocrine and paracrine pathways, these activated CAFs acquire an invasive phenotype and promote tumor cell proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis, angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, inflammatory responses and tumor microenvironment reprogramming, thus promoting the evolution of BC. Clinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a strong association between CAFs and poor prognosis in several types of cancer, including BC. However, the mechanism by which CAFs promote the development of BC remains undefined.Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1), originally identified as an upregulated gene in injured rat arteries, is involved in vascular remodeling, osteoblast formation and wound repair. In injured and diseased arteries, CTHRC1 increases cellular motility to repair the injury by restricting the deposition of collagen matrix and promoting cellular migration. In previous years, studies have revealed that the upregulation of CTHRC1 is associated with a variety of solid tumors, to include the invasion and metastasis of tumor tissues such as those of BC. Immunohistochemical results have indicated significantly higher expression of CTHRC1 in BC than in normal tissues or precursor lesions. The results of cDNA microarray and in situ hybridization also suggested high CTHRC1 expression in BC. High CTHRC1 expression was also reported to be of prognostic value in multiple cancer types, including pancreatic, gastric, non-small cell lung and gastrointestinal stromal cancer. Furthermore, CTHRC1 overexpression was recently reported to promote human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness by activating the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. As an important component of the tumor matrix, CAFs are a key component for regulating tumor progression; active communication between CAFs and cancer cells is achieved through growth factors or inflammatory cytokines that promote tumorigenesis and progression. Although several studies have revealed the involvement of CAFs in solid tumor progression, it remains unclear whether CTHRC1 is also involved in this process, and whether it acts as an intermediary between BC and CAFs.Wnt, a member of the family of secreted signaling molecules, plays a key role in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and differentiation, embryogenesis and organogenesis, cell carcinogenesis, tumor invasion and other pathological processes. At the cellular level, such versatility of Wnt signaling is achieved by activating various intracellular signaling pathways. The canonical Wnt pathway is the best- characterized pathway, which stabilizes \u03b2-catenin proteins. An increase in \u03b2-catenin level results in its translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor family of transcription factors to trigger the expression of target genes. Abnormal activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), promotes the metastasis and invasion capacities of cancer cells by decreasing the expression of cell-cell contact protein E-cadherin in vitro and in vivo. The role of CTHRC1 in the biological behaviors of BC (by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activity), especially the invasion and EMT mediated by the tumor microenvironment, remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine how CAFs regulate the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells, and how CAFs are associated with the activation of CTHRC1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in BC progression.In the current study, the expression of CTHRC1 was first verified in BC cancer tissues and serum, and their secretion sources were investigated. Then, changes in BC cell malignant behaviors were evaluated by altering the expression of CTHRC1 in the microenvironment. Finally, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) was introduced to explore the mechanisms of action of CTHRC1.Materials and methodsTissues samplesPreoperative blood samples from 43 patients with BC (provided by Cangzhou Central Hospital between August 2016 and April 2018), as well as tumor and adjacent tissues removed during surgery, were analyzed. The tumor tissue was removed from the deepest infiltration of the tumor, and the adjacent tissue was within 3 cm of the tumor. Each patient was sampled and numbered. Concurrently, blood samples from 27 healthy subjects, collected at the same hospital between July 2017 and February 2018, were selected for comparative analysis. The inclusion criteria were as follows: i) Histopathological sections identified as BC; and ii) complete pathological information. The exclusion criteria were as follows: i) Patients aged <18 years; ii) patients with a history of tumor disease; and iii) patients who had received chemotherapy, radiation therapy or immunotherapy. All tissue samples were identified by a clinical pathologist. Written informed consent was obtained from each study participant, and the research program was reviewed and approved by the Human Subject Research Ethics Committee of Cangzhou Central Hospital, and implemented under the guidelines formulated by the Committee. Detailed clinical characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table I.Cell lines and reagentsCAFs and their matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from primary BC and adjacent tissues, respectively. The fresh tissues were sliced and digested with 150 mg/ml collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and 25 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at 37\u00b0C temperature for 4 h. Thereafter, the cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) until a confluent monolayer was obtained. After 2~3 passages, a unique homogeneity of stromal fibroblasts was formed. All stromal fibroblasts (CAFs and NFs) were passaged <8 times. Normal human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A (cat. no. SCSP-575) and BC cell lines HCC1937 (cat. no. TCHu148), Hs578T (cat. no. TCHu127), MCF7 (cat. no. TCHu74) and MDA-MB- 468 (cat. no. TCHu136), were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank, and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 37\u00b0C (5% CO2) in humidified air. The neutralizing CTHRC1 antibody (Ab-CTHRC1) and IgG isotype control antibody (IgG) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA. DKK1, an inhibitor of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, was purchased from StemRD, Inc.Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) and CTHRC1 expression detectionThe CAFs and their matching NFs were seeded into 6-well plates (2\u00d7106/well) containing serum-free DMEM. After culture at 37\u00b0C for 48 h, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C for 5 min, and the supernatant (CM) was subjected to further experimentation. Prior to in vitro experiments, the CTHRC1 protein expression level in the CAF-CM and NF-CM was determined by western blotting. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.ELISAThe CTHRC1 protein levels in serum, tissue homogenates and cell culture media were quantified using a Human CTHRC1 ELISA kit (cat. no. EH135RB; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The absorbance (450 nm) of each sample was detected using a standard automatic microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.). Each sample of blood, cancer tissue and adjacent tissue was divided into three for ELISA, and the CTHRC1 protein level is presented as an average value according to the experimental results. Finally, independent or paired samples were tested and analyzed according to grouping.Immunohistochemical stainingBC and adjacent tissues from the same patient were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 24 h, embedded in paraffin and cut into 5\u20136 \u00b5m-thick slices for immunohistochemical staining. Briefly, the tissue slices were placed onto a slide and heated at 60\u00b0C for 20 min, and then exposed to xylene and graded alcohol (100, 95, 90, 80 and 70%) in turn, each at room temperature for 10 min. After rinsing with water, the sections were immersed in 3% H2O2 for 10 min to remove endogenous catalases, and 10% serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used for blocking at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Rabbit anti-human CTHRC1 primary antibodies were applied at 4\u00b0C for 12 h (1:500; cat. no. MABT889; MilliporeSigma), followed by horseradish peroxidase- conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:1,000; cat. no. ab6721; Abcam) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The sections were then stained using a DAB kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) at 37\u00b0C for 5 min, and images were captured under an optical microscope. This experiment was repeated twice, and the most representative images are displayed.Invasion and migration assaysTo evaluate cellular invasiveness, an 8-\u00b5m pore polycarbonate membrane filter was inserted into each Transwell chamber and coated with 50 \u00b5l Matrigel at a final concentration of 4 mg/ml (37\u00b0C for 30 min). Then, 5\u00d7103 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded into the upper chamber with 100 \u00b5l serum-free medium, and 1 ml DMEM containing 20% FBS was added to the bottom chamber (Control group). For the experimental groups, 1 ml CAF-CM, 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 \u00b5g lgG, 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 \u00b5g Ab-CTHRC1, 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 ng DKK1, and 1 ml CAF-CM containing 100 \u00b5g Ab-CTHRC1 and 100 ng DKK1 were added to the respective lower chambers. The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, and the non-invasive cells were removed from the upper surface of the filter membrane. The invaded cells on the lower surface were stained with crystal violet at room temperature for 1 h, rinsed with water, and dried. Images of cells from three random visual fields per filter were captured using an optical microscope (Olympus Corporation) at \u00d7200 magnification, and then counted manually. A cellular migration assay was performed in the same manner, but without Matrigel. The experiment was performed in triplicate.MTT AssayA total of 5\u00d7103 cells per well were seeded into 96-well plates. The absorbance value was determined after incubation with CM at different concentrations of DKK1 (0, 50, 100 and 200 ng/ml) for 24 h (each concentration was repeated three times). After 24 h, the absorbance of each group of cells was measured according to the instructions of the MTT cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute), and the proliferation rate was calculated based on the absorbance at 0 h. Western blotting was subsequently used to verify the effects of DKK1, and to determine the optimal concentration.Protein extraction and western blottingThe total cellular protein was extracted using a total protein extraction kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute) and quantified using the BCA method. Then, 100 \u00b5g protein per lane was then electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, after which the membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight: Rabbit anti-human E-cadherin (cat. no. ab15148), rabbit anti-human N-cadherin (cat. no. ab18203), rabbit anti-human vimentin (cat. no. ab92547), rabbit anti-human \u03b2-catenin (cat. no. ab16051), rabbit anti-human cyclin D1 (cat. no. ab134175) and rabbit anti-human c-myc (cat. no. ab32072); all at 1:1,000, all purchased from Abcam. A GAPDH antibody (1:1,000; cat. no. ab37168; Abcam) was used as the internal reference control. Then, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody IgG (HRP) (1:5,000; cat. no. ab6721; Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, images were obtained using the multifunctional Gel Imaging System (Gel Doc XR; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), and the gray value of each band was quantified and analyzed using Quantity One software (v4.6.6; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Furthermore, the detection and evaluation of CTHRC1 protein expression levels in the CAF-CM and NF-CM were assessed in the same manner using Rabbit anti-human CTHRC1 (1:2,000; cat. no. MABT889; MilliporeSigma) as primary antibodies and GAPDH as the internal control. This experiment was performed in triplicate.Statistical analysisAll values are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Corp). Differences between two groups were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. However, the differences in CTHRC1 expression level between BC and adjacent tissues were examined using a paired t-test. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare differences between multiple groups (>2), followed by Tukey's post hoc test or Bonferroni's correction. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.ResultsCTHRC1 is highly expressed in CAFs in the BC tumor microenvironmentPrevious studies have shown the relevance of CTHRC1 to specific epithelial tumors, including BC. To determine the protein level and cellular source of CTHRC1 in BC, an ELISA kit was used to detect the level of CTHRC1 in the serum and tumor tissues of patients with BC. Fig. 1A and B show significant elevation of CTHRC1 protein levels in the serum and BC tissues of patients compared with healthy volunteers (P<0.01). To confirm which BC cellular component was associated with the high expression of CTHRC1, the expression pattern in BC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. Fig. 1C suggests that CTHRC1-positive cells were primarily located at the boundary between tumor and stroma tissues, in stroma between tumor nests, and rarely within tumor tissues. However, CTHRC1-positive cells could not be detected in adjacent non-tumor tissues. Thus, we hypothesize that CAFs are the source of CTHRC1, and are the most abundant cell type in the breast tumor stroma. Therefore, the expression levels of CTHRC1 in CAFs, NFs, BC cell lines (HCC1937, Hs578T, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468) and normal human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A were evaluated by ELISA. CTHRC1 levels were significantly higher in BC cell lines compared with MCF10A cells (Fig. 1D; all P<0.01). Furthermore, the CTHRC1 level in CAFs was significantly higher than that in NFs (P<0.01). To confirm these results, the CTHRC1 protein expression level was evaluated in CAF-CM and NF-CM by western blotting, and revealed that the relative expression of CTHRC1 was significantly higher in CAF-CM than in NF-CM (Fig. 1E; P<0.01). These results suggest that CTHRC1 is significantly upregulated in BC, and that CAFs are a primary cell source of CTHRC1 in the BC microenvironment.CAFs enhance the migration and invasiveness of BC cells by secreting CTHRC1As BC cells are the key determinants of metastasis in tumor progression, the migration and invasion capacities of MDA-MB-468 cells (induced by CAFs) were determined. The CAF-CM-induced migration ability of MDA-MB-468 cells was significantly increased compared with that of the control group (Fig. 2A and B; P<0.01). However, the addition of a neutralizing CTHRC1 antibody (Ab-CTHRC1) significantly decreased migration compared with that of the isotype control (CAF-CM+lgG) (P<0.01). Furthermore Fig. 2C and D demonstrate that CAF-CM induction enhanced the invasive ability of MDA-MB-468 cells (P<0.01). Ab-CTHRC1 also reduced the invasiveness of MDA-MB-468 cells compared with the isotype control antibody (P<0.01). Hence, these findings indicate that CAFs enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of BC cells by secreting CTHRC1.CAFs promote EMT alterations in BC cells by secreting CTHRC1EMT is a recognized biological process that plays a key role in tumor metastasis, and is characterized by the loss of epithelial markers (such as E-cadherin) and the acquisition of stromal markers (such as N-cadherin and vimentin). To ascertain the role of CAFs in the EMT regulation of BC cells, MDA-MB-468 cells that crossed the filter membrane (under the premise of repeating the migration assay) were collected. Fig. 3A and B show that the expression of E-cadherin induced by CAF-CM was significantly decreased, while the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin was increased (all P<0.01). To determine whether CTHRC1 contributes to the EMT effect of CAFs on BC cells, Ab-CTHRC1 was added into the CAF-CM induction system. EMT was induced by CAF-CM, but was impaired by Ab-CTHRC1, revealing a reduction in E-cadherin and an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin (all P<0.01). Therefore, these findings indicate that CAFs promoted EMT alterations in BC cells by secreting CTHRC1.CAF-secreted CTHRC1 mediates the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathwayStudies have reported that CTHRC1 drives human oral cancer cell migration by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, and promotes human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness by activating Wnt/PCP signaling. However, to the best of our knowledge, their reports identifying whether CTHRC1 enhances the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation. Therefore, the effects of different induction systems on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway were determined using MDA-MB-468 cells. Fig. 4A and B suggest that CAF-CM induction markedly increased the expression of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc in MDA-MB-468 cells (all P<0.01). However, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling induced by CAF-CM and lgG was disrupted when CTHRC1 was inhibited by Ab-CTHRC1, which showed a degree of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression inhibition (all P<0.01).The blocking effect of DKK1 on the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway was also assessed for its ability to inhibit the tumorigenic effects on BC cells. Fig. 4C and D indicate that the effect of DKK1 was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner, with a significant anti-proliferative effect at high concentrations. Therefore, an optimal concentration of 100 ng/ml was selected. In this instance, Fig. 4E-H indicate that compared with CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1 or CAF-CM/DKK1, CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1/DKK1 significantly reduced cellular migration and invasion ability (all P<0.01). For EMT changes, CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1/DKK1 further decreased the EMT of MDA-MB-468 cells compared with CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1 and CAF-CM/DKK1 (P<0.01). Finally, to confirm the involvement of CAF-secreted CTHRC1 in malignant phenotypes via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation, the expression changes of pathway-related proteins were assessed. Fig. 4I and J show that compared with CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1 or CAF-CM/DKK1, the CAF-CM/Ab-CTHRC1/DKK1 combined induction system significantly inhibited Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway activation (all P<0.01). The results suggest that the CTHRC1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is essential for the CAF-induced migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells.DiscussionCAFs have been reported to promote tumor growth and provide an appropriate microenvironment for the proliferation, angiogenesis, migration and invasion of a variety of cancers, by secreting different pro-oncogenic factors. Therefore, CAFs may serve as an effective tool for cancer treatment in the future. Consequently, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism by which CAFs stimulate tumor growth is of great significance for understanding BC progression and potential treatment strategies. The current study concluded that CAF-secreted CTHRC1 plays a vital role in the progression of BC. We hypothesize that CAFs promote the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells by secreting CTHRC1, which activates the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Suppressing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway with a neutralizing antibody to deplete CTHRC1, or a specific inhibitor (DKK1), significantly attenuated these CAF-induced malignant phenotypes. Therefore, activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by CTHRC1 may play a useful role in the interaction between CAFs and BC cells.CTHRC1 is a secretary protein that is reportedly upregulated in various solid tumors, including melanoma, epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), hepatocellular carcinoma and BC. Hou et al reported that the overexpression of CTHRC1 promoted the EMT of EOC, and was associated with poor prognosis. Ip et al revealed that CTHRC1 protein expression was weak or undetectable in non-invasive melanoma tumors, but highly expressed in invasive melanoma. In melanoma cell line-related studies, overexpression of CTHRC1 enhanced cellular migration and adhesion, and protected melanoma cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Jin et al reported that CTHRC- knockdown inhibited the proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. In BC patients with bone metastasis, the stromal expression of CTHRC1 is markedly enhanced. In the current study, CTHRC1 protein levels in the serum and tumor tissues of patients with BC were significantly elevated compared with those of healthy volunteers. Furthermore, CTHRC1-positive cells were primarily located at the boundary between tumor and stroma tissues, and in stroma between tumor nests. Similar clinical results for CTHRC1 expression level have also been demonstrated in colorectal and endometrial cancer, and in others solid human tumors. In a comprehensive review, Jiang et al also noted that the multidimensional function of CTHRC1 was closely associated with its abnormal expression. Collectively, these data suggest that CTHRC1 is an important regulator of the tumor microenvironment. However, there are few studies on the specific microenvironmental origin of CTHRC1. Using cellular isolation and validation experiments, the results of the present study further demonstrated that the cells were derived from CAFs, which was the basis of subsequent experimentation. Considering previous reports, CTHRC1 was found to be a migration- and invasion-promoting protein in the tumor microenvironment. Secretion of CTHRC1, mainly by CAFs, strongly suggests that CAF-generated CTHRC1 promotes BC cell metastasis through several autocrine and paracrine processes.EMT is an important embryonic process, and a vital reversible process by which fully differentiated cells lose their epithelial features and gain a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. EMT contributes to the metastatic potential of several types of solid tumor via activating invasion-metastasis cascade responses, including in BC. A previous study reported that knockdown of CTHRC1 expression in EOC cells resulted in the downregulation of both N-cadherin and vimentin. Similarly, downregulation of CTHRC1 markedly accelerated the expression of E-cadherin, suppressed the expression of N-cadherin and vimentin, and inhibited the migration and invasiveness of RCC cells. E-cadherin is an epithelial calcium-binding transmembrane glycoprotein, whose downregulation is a representative biomarker of EMT, enabling tumor cells to develop an invasive phenotype, while N-cadherin exhibits the opposite function. Migration and invasiveness are prominent biological characteristics of cancer cells, and related experiments can be used as a means to study their EMT ability. In epithelial ovarian cancer, SKOV3 and HO8910 cell migration and invasion activities were significantly increased by the CM of recombinant CTHRC1-treated macrophages. In the current study, EMT induced by CAF-CM was retarded following CTHRC1 depletion by specific neutralizing antibodies, showing a reduction in E-cadherin, an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin, and the attenuation of migration and invasion ability. These results indicate that CAF-secreted CTHRC1 significantly induced EMT. In summary, the two studies have something in common: altering the microenvironment necessary for the proliferation of cancer cells to study malignant biological changes, and achieving the desired results (that decreasing CTHRC1 expression in the tumor microenvironment significantly inhibited the migration, invasion and EMT abilities of BC cells). Thus we hypothesize that the success of the experiment lies in an understanding of the primary source of CTHRC1 and its secretion characteristics, which is of great significance for subsequent in-depth research.A growing body of evidence suggests that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway plays a key role in the carcinogenesis and progression of several types of solid tumor, including BC. Therefore, in the medical community, influencing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway has been considered an effective way to treat BC. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation leads to the stabilization and accumulation of \u03b2-catenin protein in the cytoplasm, which translocates into the nucleus and induces the transcription of downstream target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-Myc. Several studies have reported that activation of these genes increases cellular proliferation, reduces cell-cell adhesion, and promotes EMT, migration and invasiveness. In the present study, CTHRC1 from CAFs promoted the migration, invasiveness and EMT of BC cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which primarily manifests in significantly upregulated levels of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. However, depleting CTHRC1 partially blocked CAF-induced activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. In addition, the combination of neutralizing antibodies and the specific inhibitor (DKK1) of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway further weakened CAF-induced pathway activation. These data demonstrate that CTHRC1 promotes the malignant biological properties of BC cells by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.Overall, we hypothesize that the crosstalk between BC cells and CAFs is conducive to migration, and invasiveness and EMT via the CTHRC1/Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Similar to normal mammary epithelial cells, CAFs are a major source of CTHRC1 protein. Extracellular CTHRC1 produced in the tumor microenvironment promotes the malignant behaviors of BC cells through autocrine and paracrine pathways. Therefore, weakening CAFs-BC cell communication by suppressing CTHRC1 expression may be a novel strategy for BC treatment. Although the present study achieved the expected results, there were some design limitations. For example, the effect on EMT of directly knocking down or increasing the expression of CTHRC1 in cancer cells was not investigated, as was by Wang et al in gastric cancer. In addition, following the administration of DKK1, necessary controls (such as without CAF-CM or lgG control) for migration and invasion were not introduced, thus it remains to be seen whether the observed effects on migration and invasion are specific to CAF-secreted CTHRC1. Future improved experiments will enhance the level of research, and focus on demonstrating the EMT-promoting effects of CTHRC1 secreted by CAFs in vivo.FundingNo funding was received.Availability of data and materialsThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.Authors' contributionsYW conceived the present study.

        "content": "Integrin beta 4 (ITGB4) overexpression in cancer cells contributes to cancer progression. However, the role of stromal ITGB4 expression in cancer progression remains poorly understood, despite stromal ITGB4 overexpression in malignant cancers. In our study, ITGB4-overexpressing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells provided cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) with ITGB4 proteins via exosomes, which induced BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and lactate production in CAFs. In coculture assays, the ITGB4-induced mitophagy and glycolysis were suppressed in CAFs by knocking down ITGB4 or inhibiting exosome generation in MDA-MB-231, or blocking c-Jun or AMPK phosphorylation in CAFs. ITGB4-overexpressing CAF-conditioned medium promoted the proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and invasion of breast cancer cells. In a co-transplant mouse model, MDA-MB-231 made a bigger tumor mass with CAFs than ITGB4 knockdown MDA-MB-231. Herein, we presented how TNBC-derived ITGB4 protein triggers glycolysis in CAFs via BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy and suggested the possibility that ITGB4-induced mitophagy could be targeted as a cancer therapy.",

        "content": "Tumor initiation and progression are not only ascribed to the behavior of cancer cells, but also profoundly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. Inside, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have become key factors to accelerate growth and metastasis for the abundance in most solid tumors. Our group previously reported that Oroxylin A (OA), a flavone from Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, possess the ability to suppress growth and invasion of several tumor cells. However, the regulatory effect of OA on stromal microenvironment is poorly understood. In this study, breast cancer-induced fibroblasts and primary breast CAFs from MMTV-PyMT mice were used to evaluate the influence of OA on the activation of fibroblasts. Results showed that OA could decrease the expression of \u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Thus, OA-deactivated CAFs did not further promote the proliferation and invasion in breast cancer cells. In vivo experiments, OA could also impede tumor metastasis through exhausting progressive CAFs. Mechanically, OA could specifically bind ACTN1 and significantly inhibit its expression to prevent CAF activation. As a consequence, OA could decrease the phosphorylation of FAK and STAT3, and reduce the secretion of CCL2 in CAFs. Altogether, OA could remodel stromal microenvironment and it is a potential therapeutic agent in breast cancer.",

Although a few targeted therapies such as inhibitors of PARP or immune checkpoints are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care. Existing therapies for TNBC are largely ineffective due to drug resistance that eventually leads to relapse and metastasis within 3-5 years of diagnosis. Therefore, alternative treatment approaches are imperative to improve outcomes for TNBC patients. Recent evidence suggests that besides alterations in cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its interactions with cancer cells (i.e., tumor-stromal interactions) promote drug resistance and disease progression. Using the TME as a therapy target has gained momentum particularly for aggressive cancers such as TNBC that have a rich stroma and limited targeted therapies.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundant stromal cells in the TME of TNBC. CAFs secrete paracrine signaling molecules that interact with cancer cells and promote tumor growth, drug resistance, and eventually metastasis. Recognizing the role of stroma-derived paracrine factors in tumorigenesis, several drugs are in clinical trials to target either CAFs, its secreted factors, or their corresponding receptors expressed on cancer cells. Despite progress in understanding the TME, identifying effective drugs against tumor-stromal interactions remains difficult. Typically, animal models and cell cultures are used for both mechanistic studies and testing drugs in preclinical stages. Animal models lack most, if not all, of human stroma and are incompatible with screening multiple compounds and dosing regimens needed in drug discovery. Monolayer cell cultures allow high throughput compound screening but lack the native architecture and components of tumor stroma and poorly predict drug responses in vivo. To address this technological gap, three-dimensional (3D) tumor models have been developed to recreate tumor-stromal interactions, including co-culture spheroids of cancer-stromal cells with or without ECM and microfluidic devices with tumor and stromal compartments. These models either do not recreate the spatial distribution of different components of the TME or are incompatible with automated platforms for drug screening. Emerging organoid technologies partially address these shortcomings, with major caveats that include the long time needed to develop them and challenges to incorporate stromal cells.We recently developed a 3D organotypic TNBC model that contains key components of the breast TME, i.e., a mass of cancer cells, activated fibroblasts, and ECM, and is compatible with automated liquid handling operations. Here, we leveraged this model and established that CAFs and TNBC cells predominantly communicate via HGF-MET paracrine signaling, activating several oncogenic pathways while promoting invasiveness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of TNBC cells. We also found that HGF-MET signaling was highly active in a lung stromal environment and promoted colony formation by TNBC cells. We identified drug combinations that significantly blocked stroma-mediated tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells.Materials and MethodsCell cultureMDA-MB-231, SUM159, Hs 578T, MDA-MB-157, HCC1806, and BT-20 TNBC cells and WI-38 lung fibroblast cells were purchased from ATCC. MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells were transduced to stably express GFP. Three different breast fibroblast cells were used: normal human mammary fibroblasts (HMF) stably transduced with mCherry protein (gift of Dr. Daniel Hayes, University of Michigan), CAFs derived from a human breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-1) and obtained from Neuromics (Cat. No. CAF06), and CAFs derived from an invasive ductal breast carcinoma tumor (CAF-2) and obtained from BioIVT (Cat. No. HPCCAFBR-05). CAFs were cultured as recommended by the vendors for up to five passages. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, Hs 578T, and HMF cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic (Life Technologies). HCC1806 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. SUM159 cells were cultured in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma), 2 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 1% glutamine (Life Technologies), and 1% antibiotic. WI-38 cells were cultured in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. Cells were plated in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and kept in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested frequently for mycoplasma contamination by PCR. No further authentication was performed for ATCC cell lines. After about 25 passages, the cells were replenished with fresh cultures from frozen stocks.Human phospho-RTK arrayA human phospho-RTK array (R&D Systems, Cat. No. ARY001B) was used to detect relative phosphorylation of 49 different RTKs on TNBC cells post-stimulation with conditioned media of CAF cells. TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and SUM159) were stimulated for 10 min with conditioned media from confluent cultures of CAFs (CAF-1 and CAF-2). For a negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed using lysis buffer 17 containing protease inhibitors (Aprotinin, Leupeptin, and Pepstatin). Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each array was blocked for 1 h with array buffer 1 and incubated with 300 \u03bcg of protein lysate overnight at 4\u00b0C. The array was washed and incubated with HRP conjugated anti-phospho-tyrosine detection antibody and developed using FluorChem E imaging (ProteinSimple). The relative phosphorylation of each RTK in the blot array was quantified by measuring pixel densities of the corresponding pair of dots on the array in ImageJ and normalized with respect to its vehicle control.Bead-based multiplex immunoassayConditioned media from confluent monolayer cultures of HMF, CAF-1, CAF-2, and WI-38 cells were collected from an overnight incubation. Concentrations of secreted factors were quantified using a magnetic bead panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HAGP1MAG-12K) for HGF, FGF-1, FGF-2 and another panel (Millipore Sigma, Cat. No. HCYTA-60K) for EGF and PDGF-AB/BB. Briefly, each conditioned medium was centrifuged to remove debris. Then, the supernatant was incubated with the premixed antibody-immobilized beads overnight at 4\u00b0C on a titer plate shaker. The beads were washed carefully three times with a wash buffer using a handheld magnet (Millipore, Cat. No. 40-285) to retain the magnetic beads in the well plate. Next, the beads were incubated with a detection antibody followed by addition of streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Median fluorescent intensity (MFI) from the beads was measured using a Luminex MAGPIX instrument. Standard curves were generated to determine concentrations of the soluble factors.Organotypic tumor model and imaging of TNBC cell invasionThe organotypic tumor model was formed in two robotic micropatterning steps using an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) technology with 5.0%(w/v) polyethylene glycol and 6.4%(w/v) dextran. First, 7.5\u00d7103 TNBC cells were microprinted in a nanodrop to form a spheroid in each well of a 384-well plate. Then, a drop containing 20 \u03bcl ice-cold rat tail type I collagen solution (Corning) and 1.5\u00d7104 suspended fibroblasts was dispensed into each well. The 384-well plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to form the tumor model with fibroblasts dispersed in a collagen gel containing a mass of TNBC cells. For confocal imaging, the tumor models were formed in a glass bottom 384-well plate (MatTek, Cat. No. PBK384G). Images were captured with a 10X objective on days 1 and 5 of culture (Nikon A1). TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Z-projected images were constructed from images of samples acquired with a z-spacing of 20 \u03bcm. NIS software was used for image acquisition and Fiji (ImageJ, NIH) was used for image analysis and 3D reconstruction. The total pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with CAF-1 or CAF-2 was normalized to the pixel area of TNBC cells when cultured with HMF. Unlabeled collagen fibers were imaged using confocal reflectance microscopy.Flow cytometryTo quantify the proliferation of TNBC cells in organotypic models 5 days after formation, the collagen matrix was digested using collagenase I (Sigma) and mechanical agitation for 15 min. Collagenase activity was neutralized by adding triple amounts of complete growth medium. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was suspended in 300 \u03bcl of medium and then 50 \u03bcl of suspension of counting beads (CountBright, Invitrogen) was added. Cells were analyzed with a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. At least 103 counting bead events were acquired while running each sample. Non-fluorescing TNBC cells were used to remove the background fluorescence. The GFP+ TNBC cells were gated from unstained fibroblasts. The absolute TNBC cell number was obtained as (number of TNBC events/number of bead events) \u00d7 number of beads.Quantitative PCRCells were harvested from organotypic cultures and lysed using a Total RNA Kit lysis buffer (Omega BioTek). The lysate was passed through homogenizer mini columns (Omega BioTek). Total RNA was obtained using an RNA isolation kit (Omega BioTek). After removing DNA using RNase-free DNase (Omega BioTek), purity and concentration of isolated RNA were assessed using optical density (OD) 260/280 spectrophotometry (Synergy H1M, BioTek Instruments). cDNA was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of total RNA using random hexamer primers (Roche). Real-time qPCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 instrument II using a SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche). After combining 50 ng of cDNA with the primer and the SYBR Green Master Mix to a final volume of 15 \u03bcl, the reactions were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of amplification, that is, at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, at 60\u00b0C for 10 s, and at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The primer sequences for the genes are listed in Table S1. Gene expression values were calculated relative to \u03b2-actin and GAPDH using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. mRNA fold change was determined from the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method.Western blottingOrganotypic cultures were treated with collagenase I for 15 min with added mechanical agitation. The collagenase activity was neutralized using triple amounts of complete growth media. The resulting suspension was centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet. The cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed with 500 \u03bcl of complete RIPA buffer containing 1% protease inhibitors and 1% phosphatase inhibitors. For stimulation experiments, MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells were stimulated for 10 min with CAF-1 and CAF-2 conditioned media with or without crizotinib (0.5 \u03bcM or 1 \u03bcM). For negative control, TNBC cells were incubated with culture medium only for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested using RIPA buffer. The cell suspension was further sonicated twice at a 20% amplitude for 5 sec (Vibra-Cell, Sonics). A BCA protein quantification assay was used to measure total protein concentration from each sample, which was then loaded onto a 4-15% gel (Bio-rad) for electrophoresis. Each gel was transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, blocked in 5% non-fat dried milk prepared in wash buffer for 1 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies: phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9101), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2, Cat. No. 9102), phospho-Akt (Ser473, Cat. No. 4060), Akt (pan, Cat. No. 4691), phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705, Cat. No. 9145), Stat3 (Cat. No. 4904), E-Cadherin (Cat. No.14472), N-Cadherin (Cat. No. 13116), Vimentin (Cat. No. 5741), phospho-Met (Tr1234/1235, Cat. No. 3077), Met (Cat. No. 8198), and GAPDH (Cat. No. 5174), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The membranes were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Detection was done using ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare) with FluorChem E system.Drug treatments of TNBC spheroidsInhibitors of MAPK (trametinib, ulixertinib, SCH772984) and PI3K/Akt (dactolisib, apitolisib, VS-5584) were purchased from Selleckchem. Dactolisib was dissolved in dimethylformamide and all other compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The compounds were used at 1\u00d710\u22124 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 5\u00d710\u22123 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22122 \u03bcM, 1\u00d710\u22121 \u03bcM, 1\u00d7100 \u03bcM, and 1\u00d7101 \u03bcM against free floating spheroids of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells. Untreated spheroids were kept in culture media. After 4 days of drug treatments, the GFP signal from TNBC cells was measured using a plate reader and the fluorescent signal was normalized to that from the vehicle control spheroids to construct dose\u2013response curves (GraphPad Prism) and calculate LD50 values.Cyclic treatment regimenTo model resistance of cancer cells to monotherapies, MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids at a 1:1 ratio were cyclically treated with 5 nM (i.e., 0.5\u00d7LD50) trametinib for 28 days. Each experiment included four cycles of treatment (T1, T2, T3, T4) each followed by a recovery phase (R1, R2, R3). Phase images were captured at the end of each cycle to approximate the volume of spheroids. The GFP signal from TNBC cells was normalized to that from day 0 to calculate a percent viability. A growth rate metric (kc), defined as the difference in the volumes of spheroids after and before each treatment divided by 4 days treatment, was used to quantify trametinib resistance.Combination treatments of organotypic culturesOrganotypic cultures were treated with crizotinib/trametinib or crizotinib/dactolisib combinations prepared in culture medium with 1% FBS. Each inhibitor was used at five concentrations, 0.1 \u2013 50 nM for trametinib and dactolisib, and 1 \u2013 5 \u03bcM for crizotinib, which were selected based on dose-responses of free-floating spheroids of the cells. Single-agent treatments with trametinib and dactolisib were also carried out, resulting in a 6\u00d76 matrix of concentration pairs, each with four replicates. Treatments were renewed after 72 h. Confocal images of the cultures were captured on day 5. The area occupied by TNBC cells was measured, normalized with the respective vehicle control, and represented as an invasion area to quantify the effect of each treatment. The fraction of cells affected by each treatment was calculated as 1-invasion area. A synergy analysis was performed to generate a combination index (CI) for pairs of drugs.Colony formation assay and immunofluorescence imaging of proliferative cellsTNBC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, SUM159, Hs 578T), with or without WI-38 lung fibroblast cells, were seeded as a single cell suspension in a 1.2% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sigma) gel made using 1% FBS-containing medium. A 1:4 ratio of TNBC:WI-38 cells was used and each well of a 384-well plate contained 50 TNBC cells and 200 WI-38 cells. Culture medium with 1% FBS was replaced every 3 days. The cultures were treated with 0.5 \u03bcM crizotinib and maintained for 8-10 days to image the colonies. The TNBC cells without GFP were stained with Calcein AM prior to imaging at a 2.5X magnification. An in-house python code in ImageJ was used to automatically detect the colonies in each image and compute their areas. A threshold colony diameter of 75 \u03bcm was used for statistical analysis. The TNBC colonies were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, washed with PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 3% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Samples were incubated overnight with a Ki-67 rabbit antibody in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS (Cell Signaling, Cat. No. 9027). Samples were washed and incubated with a rhodamine red donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:100, Cat. No. 711-295-152) for 1h and imaged. Ki-67+ cells were counted per TNBC colony and Ki-67/colony area ratios were normalized to the average in the respective vehicle control group, i.e., TNBC cells without WI-38 cells and crizotinib treatment.Bioinformatics analysis of data from breast cancer patientsThe mRNA expression data from 2509 publicly available cases of invasive breast carcinoma were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, METABRIC dataset), using cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/). A query was performed to analyze co-expression of EGFR and MET genes. Co-expression of EGFR and MET proteins was also analyzed using protein expression data from the Firehose legacy breast cancer dataset (TCGA). The activities of p-EGFR and p-MET were determined from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) available through MD Anderson Cancer Center.Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)Gene expression data of GSE138139 was downloaded from the GEO database. For GSEA, the number of permutations was set to 1,000. The platform of this dataset is the GPL1261 Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 array. The enrichment score was calculated according to metastasis status (lung metastasis versus parental breast cancer cells). Differences of a nominal p<0.05 and an FDR less than 25% defined significance.Statistical analysisData were first checked for normality using the Anderson-Darling method in MINITAB. For normally-distributed data, one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparisons was used to compare means among three or more samples. A two-tailed, unpaired t-test was used to compare two experimental groups. Normally-distributed data from experiments were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Non-Gaussian distributed data were analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. Values of p<0.05 denoted statistical significance.Data availabilityThe data generated in this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Data file. Any materials may be made available from the corresponding author upon request.ResultsCAFs interact with TNBC cells via HGF-MET pathwayWe stimulated TNBC cells with conditioned medium of CAF-1 and CAF-2 cultures and used a phospho-RTK array to detect activities of 49 RTKs in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1). While both TNBC cells had high basal EGFR activity, stimulation with CAFs significantly activated MET. CAF-1 led to 25 and 30-fold increase in pMET levels and marginally affected pEGFR by 0.7 and 1.5-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively (Fig. 1b). CAF-2 also increased pMET by 3.7 and 5.5-fold and minimally changed pEGFR by 0.8 and 1.3-fold in MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells, respectively. Thus, CAFs predominantly activated MET in TNBC cells. To further validate this finding, we treated six different TNBC cells with conditioned media from the CAFs and found significant activation of MET in all six TNBC cells by CAF-1 and in five of the TNBC cells by CAF-2 (Fig. 1c\u2013d). Despite MET protein expression in the TNBC cells (i.e., high t-MET levels), paracrine signaling with CAFs activated it (i.e., p-MET) (Fig. 1c). We ensured that MET activation was indeed due to paracrine signaling with CAFs using an immunoassay that showed both CAFs secrete high levels of the MET ligand, HGF, i.e., ~10.2 ng/ml by CAF-1 and ~1 ng/ml by CAF-2 (Fig. 1e). In contrast, HMFs secreted only 50 pg/ml of HGF. Other soluble factors such as EGF, FGF-1 and FGF-2, and PDGF AA/AB were not detectable. Taken together, these results indicate that CAFs from patients secrete HGF and predominantly activate MET in TNBC cells.CAFs activate multiple oncogenic pathways in TNBC cellsActive RTKs regulate various signaling pathways that drive breast cancer progression. We evaluated activities of several prominent pathways in breast cancers including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT. While MDA-MB-231 cells had basal MAPK/ERK activity due to an activating mutation in K-Ras, CAF-1 led to activation of both Akt and STAT3, whereas CAF-2 only activated Akt (Fig. 2a). In SUM159 cells that had basal PI3K/Akt pathway activity due to a mutation in PI3K, both CAFs activated ERK and STAT3 signaling (Fig. 2a). CAF-1 had a greater effect in activation of these pathways than CAF-2 because of its higher HGF production that led to significantly higher MET activation in TNBC cells (Fig. 1c\u2013d). To validate the role of HGF-MET signaling in activating these pathways, we used a MET inhibitor, crizotinib, against TNBC cells stimulated with CAF-1. We selected only CAF-1 for this experiment because of its greater effect on promoting oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells. This treatment led to a dose-dependent significant reduction in activation of ERK, Akt, and STAT3 in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells (Fig. 2b). Overall, these results established that CAFs promote several downstream pathways in TNBC cells through HGF-MET signaling.MET expression and activity in patient tumorsTo determine the clinical relevance of MET in TNBC, we analyzed MET gene expression in different breast cancer subtypes in TCGA. Basal and claudin-low subtypes of breast cancer, which primarily represent TNBC, showed significantly higher expression of MET than other subtypes (Fig. 3a). We also found a moderate, but significant correlation between MET and EGFR at both gene and protein levels (Fig. 3b). To determine functional activities of MET and EGFR in breast tumors, we analyzed data for invasive breast carcinomas and found a significant correlation between p-MET and p-EGFR (Fig. 3c). This analysis of data from patient tumors underlines the significance of MET activity in TNBC, and together with our results, suggests a critical role for CAFs to predominantly activate MET in EGFR+ TNBC cells.CAFs promote pro-metastatic functions in TNBC cellsOur organotypic tumor 3D model mimics the architecture and positioning of cancer and stromal cells in solid tumors. The model has a matrix stiffness of ~2.5 kPa as in human breast tumors (Fig. 4a). Using this model, we studied the role of CAFs on matrix invasion of TNBC cells. We found that unlike HMF cells, CAF-1 and CAF-2 promoted ECM invasion of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells by up to ~2.5-fold (Fig. 4b\u2013c). Furthermore, our analysis of organotypic models showed that both CAFs promoted proliferation of the TNBC cells by up to ~1.3-fold within 5 days (Fig. 4d\u2013e).Due to the role of EMT in local invasion of cancer cells and metastasis, we investigated whether CAFs promote an EMT phenotype in TNBC cells. Invading TNBC cells in organotypic models containing CAF-1 or CAF-2 displayed a significantly more elongated morphology compared to those with HMF cells (Fig. 5a). To validate this result, we quantified gene expression of several EMT transcription factors. Co-cultures with CAF-1 and CAF-2 upregulated most EMT markers in TNBC cells (Fig. 5b). CAF-1 enhanced expression of SLUG and FOXC2 in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL and ZEB2 in SUM159 cells by more than 3-fold. CAF-2 also increased expression of SLUG and FOXC2 by nearly or more than 2-fold in MDA-MB-231 cells and SNAIL in SUM159 cells by over 2-fold. We further validated these results and showed that stimulation with CAF-1 conditioned medium led to elevation of vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells and N-cadherin in SUM159 cells (Fig. 5c). CAF-2 cells did not induce a detectable change in these proteins in the TNBC cells. Overall, these results indicate that CAFs shift these mesenchymal-like TNBC cells further toward a mesenchymal phenotype.Modeling resistance of TNBC cells to single-agent treatmentsFrequent emergence of drug resistance to monotherapies in solid tumors typically necessitates combination therapies to increase treatment efficacy and durability. Next, we asked to what extent single-agent targeting of constitutively-active oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells would lead to drug resistance and a potential function of HGF-cMET signaling in drug resistance. To select drug compounds for these experiments, we used TNBC spheroids and performed a dose-dependent screening of a set of molecular inhibitors against MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Fig. S2). Our quantitative analysis showed that the most effective inhibitors were trametinib against MDA-MB-231 cells with an LD50 of 10 nM and dactolisib against SUM159 cells with an LD50 of 1 \u03bcM. Then, we treated MDA-MB-231:CAF-1 co-culture spheroids with trametinib in a cyclic regimen to mimic intermittent chemotherapy cycles (Fig. 6a). Trametinib reduced the size of spheroids during the first two treatment rounds (T1 and T2) (Fig. 6b) and reduced cancer cell viability to 41% at the end of T2 (Fig. 6c). However, after the second recovery round (R2), trametinib became significantly less effective. At the end of the 28-day regimen, spheroids treated with trametinib were 3.04-fold larger than those after T1 and the GFP fluorescence intensity of the MDA-MB-231 cells, i.e., an approximate measure of number of cells, increased by 3.11-fold compared to that after T1. We used a growth rate metric (kc) to quantify the treatment effect (Fig. 6d). Although kc for the spheroids reduced during T1 and T2, it significantly increased during T3 and T4. The kc values of spheroids from T1 to T4 increased from \u22120.0059 mm3/day to 0.0172 mm3/day. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we evaluated activation of ERK, Akt, and MET following T1 and T3 treatments (Fig. 6e). Trametinib treatment reduced pERK and pMET levels but upregulated pAKT during T1. Following T3, there was significant activation of ERK and MET and persistent activity of Akt. These findings suggest feedback signaling between PI3K/Akt and MAPK/MEK pathways and gain of MET activity to drive ERK signaling as potential mechanisms of trametinib resistance of TNBC cells.Combination treatments to suppress tumorigenic activities of TNBC cellsNext, we evaluated the feasibility of a combination treatment strategy to simultaneously suppress proliferation, invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in organotypic cultures. Because HGF from CAFs activated MET in TNBC cells, we hypothesized that treatments blocking the HGF-MET axis and its downstream pathways could potentially inhibit tumorigenic activities of TNBC cells. To test this hypothesis, we selected a combination of inhibitors of MET and MAPK pathway for MDA-MB-231 cells and MET and PI3K/Akt pathway for SUM159 cells and performed matrix-style combination treatments. This selection reflects different constitutively active kinase pathways in the TNBC cells, i.e., MAPK pathway in MDA-MB-231 and PI3K/Akt pathway in SUM159 cells (Fig. 2a). We used CAF-1 for these experiments because it had a greater effect on promoting invasion, proliferation, EMT, and oncogenic signaling in TNBC cells than CAF-2.Representative images of MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cells in organotypic cultures under single-agent and combination treatments and the quantified inhibition of invasion are shown in Fig. 7a\u2013d. While each compound alone reduced cancer cell invasion, the combination treatments more effectively inhibited invasion at low concentrations. With the organotypic cultures of MDA-MB-231, trametinib/crizotinib up to and including the 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair showed significantly greater effects than the individual drugs. The 5 nM/1 \u03bcM pair synergistically reduced cell invasion by 93% and resulted in CI=0.34. With the organotypic cultures of SUM159, crizotinib/dactolisib up to and including the 1 \u03bcM/1 \u03bcM pair were more effective than each compound alone with the combination blocking SUM159 cell invasion by up to 96% with a CI = 0.39. Although the drug combinations also reduced MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 cell proliferation in organotypic models by 1.76-fold and 2.0-fold (Fig 7e\u2013f), respectively, results suggest that TNBC proliferation was primarily driven by the constitutive pathway in each TNBC cell line because reduction in proliferation was mainly realized using the respective inhibitor of each pathway rather than crizotinib.Next, we studied inhibitory effects of the treatments on downstream signaling pathways. The crizotinib/trametinib pair downregulated activities of MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/STAT pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly greater than those from the respective responses when each compound was used alone (Fig. 7g). Additionally, it significantly reduced expression of various EMT gene and protein markers (Fig. 7h\u2013i). With SUM159 organotypic cultures, the dactolisib/crizotinib pair also significantly reduced activities of the three signaling pathways (Fig. 7j) and EMT markers (Fig. 7k\u2013l). Overall, these results provide compelling evidence that the selected combinations treatments effectively block CAFs-mediated pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells by simultaneously blocking signaling activities in multiple prominent oncogenic pathways.HGF-MET pathway promotes TNBC survival and colony formation in lung stromaDue to the prevalence of TNBC metastasis to lung, we asked whether HGF-MET pathway has a role in supporting TNBC cell survival and colony formation in the lung. We used a Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set collection and derived 14 MET signature genes based on their association with activated MET. Our analysis of results from a study of a murine metastasis model of human TNBC showed that these genes were significantly enriched in lung metastasis (Fig. S3a). This was consistent with other studies that showed lung stromal cells secrete high levels of HGF. To investigate functional effects of HGF-MET signaling in lung stroma, we used WI-38 lung fibroblast cells to determine to what extent they impact colony formation of TNBC cells. First, we validated that WI-38 cells activate MET receptors in both MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 TNBC cells (Fig. S3b). We ensured the specificity of this activity by analyzing the secretome of WI-38 cells and found that these cells secrete ~7.2 ng/ml of HGF (Fig. S3c).To study the role of lung fibroblasts in survival and proliferation of TNBC cells, we developed a 3D lung stromal environment consisting of a methylcellulose hydrogel and dispersed WI-38 cells. The hydrogel also contained single TNBC cells to represent metastatic cells. We used four different TNBC cell lines at a 1:4 ratio to WI-38 cells to mimic the relatively small population of cancer cells compared to the resident stromal cells in metastatic sites. Results showed that WI-38 cells significantly promote colony formation of SUM159, Hs578T, and MDA-MB-157 cells by 1.61, 4.0, and 3.0-fold, respectively (Fig. S3d). We validated that this response was indeed due to the HGF-MET pathway by showing that crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of all three TNBC cells (Fig. S3d). Immunofluorescent staining of the cultures also showed a significant increase in Ki-67+ TNBC cells, which was reversed by blocking the HGF-MET axis (Fig. S3e). We note that WI-38 cells did not increase colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with a study that showed formation of MDA-MB-231 lung micrometastases significantly larger than our selected threshold to quantify colonies requires a much longer time than we used. Collectively, these results demonstrate that lung fibroblasts provide a permissive niche for survival and metastatic colonization of TNBC cells via the HGF-MET axis and suggest that blocking this pathway may provide benefits against both primary TNBC and lung metastasis.DiscussionTNBC is a heterogeneous disease that presents six different subtypes with significant activities of RTKs and downstream Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Although PARP and immune checkpoint inhibitors are now available for advanced TNBC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay treatment. Thus, disrupting tumor-stromal interactions may provide new targeted therapies for TNBC. We developed an organotypic tumor model to mechanistically study interactions of TNBC cells with patient-derived CAFs. Patient-derived CAFs predominantly secreted HGF, consistent with studies that showed CAFs in breast tumors produce as high as 50 ng/ml of HGF. However, CAFs from different patients showed a significant difference in HGF production due to inter-tumoral heterogeneity that is a characteristic of CAFs in breast tumors (Fig. S4). Although several reports have shown that breast cancer cells can produce HGF to activate MET in an autocrine signaling manner, we did not detect HGF in supernatants of TNBC cells. Furthermore, all six TNBC cell lines used had endogenous MET expression, in agreement with data from human breast tumors showing significantly higher MET gene expression in basal and claudin-low subtypes compared to other breast cancers (Fig. 3). Other studies have shown that MET is frequently overexpressed in malignant breast tissues and TNBC tumors, and its expression is a strong independent marker for poor prognosis in breast carcinoma. Consistent with the role of stroma in breast tumorigenicity, CAFs from patients significantly promoted proliferation, matrix invasion, and EMT of TNBC cells in our organotypic tumor model. Our analysis of RTK activities of TNBC cells showed high basal activation of EGFR, consistent with EGFR overexpression in up to 78% of TNBC tumors. But in the presence of CAFs, the HGF-MET axis was the dominant oncogenic signaling pathway. This finding highlights a potential reason for the failure of anti-EGFR monotherapies in TNBC, consistent with our results that showed EGFR inhibitors were not effective against TNBC cell invasiveness (Fig. S5a) or CAFs-mediated MET activation (Fig. S5b). However, crizotinib alone significantly reduced matrix invasion and EGFR activity of TNBC cells (Fig. S5a). These results emphasize limitations of targeting only genetic aberrations of cancer cells and the importance of tumor-stromal interactions as a therapeutic target in TNBC. Using a defined matrix in our model is a major advantage to capture effects of specific CAFs-TNBC signaling without additional stimulatory and inhibitory factors present in animal-derived matrices such as Matrigel. Selecting human collagen for our model was guided by previous finding that TNBC has a significant enrichment for collagen deposition compared with the luminal subtypes.Leveraging our 3D organotypic model that allows mechanistic studies to guide treatments, we investigated both single-agent and combination treatments against HGF-MET and its downstream pathways. As expected, single-agent inhibition of the MAPK pathway in a long-term, cyclic treatment regimen led to resistance of TNBC cells. Consistent with our finding, prior studies have shown feedback activation of oncogenic kinase pathways as a major resistance mechanism. To simultaneously suppress matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells, we designed combination treatments against both TNBC-CAFs interactions and basal active signaling in TNBC cells, i.e., crizotinib/trametinib for MDA-MB-231 cells and crizotinib/dactolisib for SUM159 cells. This strategy was critical because targeting only the TNBC-CAFs interaction or the TNBC cells proved insufficient. For example, using a MAPK inhibitor (trametinib) alone against MDA-MB-231 cells led to drug resistance (Fig. 6), whereas targeting only the CAFs-mediated MET activation using crizotinib alone reduced but did not block activities of signaling proteins in TNBC cells (Fig. 7). We note that crizotinib alone was very effective in downregulating oncogenic pathways in TNBC cells with a brief 10 min treatment, but this was reversed over a 5-day treatment, indicating that TNBC cells become resistant to monotherapy with crizotinib as well. The combination treatment successfully blocked activities of these pathways. In addition to the role of HGF-MET in primary tumor progression, this signaling promoted colony forming capability of TNBC cells in a lung stromal environment, consistent with the role of lung stromal cells in promoting metastatic colonization of cancer cells. Other studies showed that HGF significantly increased lung metastasis of breast cancer cells in mouse models. Interestingly, disrupting HGF-MET using crizotinib significantly reduced colony formation of TNBC cells in our model of lung stroma, suggesting that this pathway has therapeutic value against TNBC metastases formation in the lungs.In conclusion, we developed an organotypic 3D tumor model and demonstrated that interactions between TNBC cells and patient-derived CAFs occur predominantly through HGF-MET axis. This tumor-stromal signaling activated several oncogenic pathways and promoted pro-metastatic activities of TNBC cells and colony formation in the lung stroma. We developed a design-driven approach and showed the feasibility of targeting tumor-stromal interactions using specific drug combinations to significantly inhibit matrix invasion, proliferation, and EMT of TNBC cells in a primary tumor environment and their metastatic colonization in a lung stromal environment. Our engineered tumor model is conducive to phenotypic and mechanistic studies to identify new therapeutic opportunities against tumor-stromal interactions and develop and screen the effectiveness of various treatment combinations and regimens. We also note that CAFs also degrade and deposit ECM and change its mechanical properties. Investigating integrated effects of biochemical and mechanical inputs to facilitate cancer cell invasiveness can inform targeting of tumor-stromal interactions.Supplementary MaterialDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest: Authors declare no conflict of interest.ReferencesPrognostic markers in triple-negative breast cancerTargeted Therapies for Triple-Negative Breast CancerComprehensive Profiling of Poor-Risk Paired Primary and Recurrent Triple-Negative Breast Cancers Reveals Immune Phenotype ShiftsRisk of regional recurrence in triple-negative breast cancer patients: a Dutch cohort studyInfluence of tumour micro-environment heterogeneity on therapeutic responseThe biology and function of fibroblasts in cancerTumour micro-environment elicits innate resistance to RAF inhibitors through HGF secretionA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsThe updated landscape of tumor microenvironment and drug repurposingModeling and predicting clinical efficacy for drugs targeting the tumor milieuThree-dimensional tumor model mimics stromal - breast cancer cells signalingA Human Organotypic Microfluidic Tumor Model Permits Investigation of the Interplay between Patient-Derived Fibroblasts and Breast Cancer CellsThree-dimensional models of breast cancer-fibroblasts interactionsA Living Biobank of Breast Cancer Organoids Captures Disease HeterogeneityOrganotypic breast tumor model elucidates dynamic remodeling of tumor microenvironmentMicrofluidic Endothelium for Studying the Intravascular Adhesion of Metastatic Breast Cancer CellsHigh Throughput, Polymeric Aqueous Two-Phase Printing of Tumor SpheroidsNanolitre liquid patterning in aqueous environments for spatially defined reagent delivery to mammalian cellsMicroprinted Stem Cell Niches Reveal Compounding Effect of Colony Size on Stromal Cells-Mediated Neural DifferentiationCyclical Treatment of Colorectal Tumor Spheroids Induces Resistance to MEK InhibitorsSynergistic Inhibition of Kinase Pathways Overcomes Resistance of Colorectal Cancer Spheroids to Cyclic Targeted TherapiesThe somatic mutation profiles of 2,433 breast cancers refine their genomic and transcriptomic landscapes (vol 7, 11479, 2016)TCPA: a resource for cancer functional proteomics dataPhytochemicals inhibit migration of triple negative breast cancer cells by targeting kinase signalingEpigenetic regulation of RTK signalingPhosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase or RAS pathway mutations in human breast cancer cell linesThe nanomechanical signature of breast cancerEMT, MET, Plasticity, and Tumor MetastasisRational Approaches for Combination Therapy Strategies Targeting the MAP Kinase Pathway in Solid TumorsThe Molecular Signatures Database Hallmark Gene Set CollectionHepatocyte growth factor produced in lung fibroblasts enhances non-small cell lung cancer cell survival and tumor progressionMetastasis-initiating cells induce and exploit a fibroblast niche to fuel malignant colonization of the lungsThe Proteomic Landscape of Triple-Negative Breast CancerIdentification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapiesBreast Cancer Cells Induce Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts to Secrete Hepatocyte Growth Factor to Enhance Breast TumorigenesisSingle-Cell Analysis Reveals Fibroblast Clusters Linked to Immunotherapy Resistance in CancerCancer-associated fibroblast heterogeneity in axillary lymph nodes drives metastases in breast cancer through complementary mechanismsCoexpression of hepatocyte growth factor and receptor (Met) in human breast carcinomaMet induces diverse mammary carcinomas in mice and is associated with human basal breast cancerExpression of scatter factor and c-met receptor in benign and malignant breast tissueExpression of c-met is a strong independent prognostic factor in breast carcinomaMet induces mammary tumors with diverse histologies and is associated with poor outcome and human basal breast cancerChemokines released by breast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition in MCF7 breast cancer cellsMolecular characterization of EGFR and EGFR-downstream pathways in triple negative breast carcinomas with basal like featuresThe paradoxical functions of EGFR during breast cancer progressionHuman breast cancer invasion and aggression correlates with ECM stiffening and immune cell infiltrationMesenchymal Cancer Cell-Stroma Crosstalk Promotes Niche Activation, Epithelial Reversion, and Metastatic ColonizationTargeted expression of HGF/SF in mouse mammary epithelium leads to metastatic adenosquamous carcinomas through the activation of multiple signal transduction pathwaysApigenin inhibits HGF-promoted invasive growth and metastasis involving blocking PI3K/Akt pathway and beta 4 integrin function in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cellsCAFs interact with TNBC cells predominantly through the HGF-MET pathway.

Collagen metabolism is deregulated in many chronic diseases including cancer. Increased type I collagen expression and desmoplasia/fibrosis in tumors are associated with increased risk of metastasis. An increasing body of evidence suggests that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote cancer fibrosis and progression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) ligands produced by cancer cells and/or CAFs promote the accumulation of fibrotic desmoplastic tissue and the rate of cancer progression.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the second-most frequent cause of cancer death. Of the various classes of human breast cancer, triple-negative (ER\u2212PR\u2212HER2\u2212) breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive type, and no targeted therapy is available. In addition, TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases and show poor prognosis when there is evidence of central fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 ligands are often enriched in the TNBC tumor microenvironment. This suggests that targeting the desmoplasia/fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC could be of value.In the present study, we have evaluated TNBC tumors that have enhanced collagen expression to determine whether we can reduce metastasis by targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD). PFD is an orally administered pyridine (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone) that exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, and has been clinically developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).RESULTSTNBC xenograft tumors exhibit accumulated collagen and activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and metastasize to lungsTo determine fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 activation in TNBC as a model, we used patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that retain the essential features of the original patient tumors and metastasis to specific sites (HCI-001 and HCI-002), and thus are authentic experimental systems for studying human cancer metastasis. In these models, the tumors engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice grew to approximately 1 cm in 5-8 weeks (Supplementary Figure S1A). Enhanced collagen accumulation was exhibited in the primary tumors (Figure 1A). Lung metastasis was also detected in HCI-001 model (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1B). Although some reports show collagen deposition in metastatic sites of mice and patients, we did not detect marked collagen accumulation in the lung metastases (Figure 1B, right panel).PDX models of TNBC exhibit enhanced collagen accumulation, activated TGF-\u03b2 signaling and lung metastasisA. TNBC xenograft tumors show enhanced collagen accumulation by picro-sirius red staining (left panel). Fibrillar collagen was quantified by picro-sirius red staining using ImageJ software. n=2-3 (right panel). B. Lung metastasis was detected in the TNBC xenograft model by H&E staining (left panel) and picro-sirius red staining (right panel). C. TNBC xenograft tumors were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma. Phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, not in stroma. D. Lungs of the TNBC xenograft model were immunostained with anti-phospho-SMAD2 (red on left panel) and anti-phospho-SMAD3 (red on right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors, but not the stroma around the small tumors.To evaluate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we determined expression of phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 as intracellular markers of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Phospho-SMAD2 was widely expressed in primary tumors and stroma, while phospho-SMAD3 was sporadically expressed in primary tumors, but not in stroma (Figure 1C). Phospho-SMAD2 and phospho-SMAD3 were expressed in the lung metastatic tumors and also in the stroma around the large metastases, but not in the stroma around the micrometastases (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1D). These observations of our TNBC xenograft models are consistent with TNBC-related fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling showed previously.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelCAFs have been reported to promote breast tumor progression in vitro and in vivo, although it has yet to be determined whether normal mammary fibroblasts suppress or promote breast cancers. We isolated CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 2A, left panel). Vimentin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) are markers commonly used for identification of CAFs, as FAP is not expressed in adult normal tissue. The cultured cells had an elongated appearance and reduced cell-cell contact and expressed vimentin and the CAF marker FAP, but not pan-cytokeratin, an epithelial tumor marker (Figure 2A, middle and right panels and Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). We then cultured CAFs derived from the TNBC xenograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2C). Since the CAFs did not express human-specific vimentin (Supplementary Figure S2D), these data suggest that the dominant fibroblast population in the xenograft models is derived from the mouse.CAFs promote primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in TNBC mouse modelA. We cultured CAFs from fresh tumor specimens of breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator (Bright Field, left panel). Immunofluorescence of cultured CAFs was conducted by using anti-vimentin (Vim, red), anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green in middle panel), and anti-fibroblast activation protein (FAP, green in right panel) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. CAFs were stained with anti-vimentin and anti-FAP antibodies. B. We transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5). Representative photographs of 4T1 primary tumor after transplantation with or without the CAFs are shown (left panel). CAFs promoted primary tumor growth. Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.02 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of lungs showed that CAFs promoted lung metastasis. Arrows indicate visible lung metastatic tumors and a broad arrow indicates a metastatic lymph node in the right brachium (left panel). Volume (mm3) of single metastatic tumor was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). *p<0.05 (middle panel). H&E staining showed that CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor number (*p<0.02) (right panel). n=5. D. Representative photographs of picro-sirius red staining showed that CAFs promoted primary tumor fibrosis (left panel). Collagen deposition marked by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation in primary tumors. n=5, *p<0.01 (right panel). E. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Representative photographs showed that CAFs enhanced expression level of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors were quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.02 (right panel).We next determined the effects of CAFs on TNBC in vivo. We cultured CAFs derived from 4T1, a mouse TNBC cell line, homograft tumors (Supplementary Figure S2E and MATERIALS AND METHODS). When we transplanted 4T1 cells with or without those CAFs into mammary glands of BALB/c mice, CAFs promoted primary tumor growth (Figure 2B) and increased lung metastatic tumor size and numbers (Figure 2C). Significantly, CAFs enhanced collagen accumulation and increased the expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 in primary tumors (Figure 2D and 2E). These results suggest that CAFs may enhance TNBC progression through TGF-\u03b2 activation, as described previously.PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsOur data from the PDX tumors indicate that some TNBC have increased fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2. We therefore hypothesized that an anti-fibrotic agent as well as a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist may be effective for TNBC treatment. PFD exhibits antifibrotic properties in a variety of in vitro and animal models of fibrosis, and has shown efficacy and safety in patients with liver fibrosis, renal fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In animal models of fibrosis in the lung, liver, kidney and heart, PFD reduces fibrosis and downregulates TGF-\u03b2 and other molecules. We first evaluated toxicity of PFD in normal mammary organoids by 3D assay and confirmed PFD was not toxic at 100\u03bcM (Supplementary Figure S3A). According to previous reports, higher concentrations than those in our tests do not cause death of normal fibroblasts. However, PFD decreased the number of live CAFs and increased the number of dead CAFs from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients (Figure 3A).PFD has inhibitory effects on cell viability and collagen production in CAFsA. We cultured CAFs derived from tumor specimens of luminal-type breast cancer patients in a 3% O2 incubator and treated them with PFD in triplicate. Representative photographs are shown (upper panels). Total cells were stained with trypan blue on Day 4. Live cells decreased and dead cells increased with higher concentration of PFD (lower panels). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 compared to the control condition. B. FACS analysis was conducted from dissociated HCI-001 TNBC xenograft tumor cells by using anti-CD49f and anti-EpCAM antibodies and then CD49f+ cells (tumor cells) and CD49f\u2212 cells (mainly stromal cells) were sorted. 4,000 CD49f+ cells or 10,000 CD49f\u2212 cells were plated with each PFD concentration for culture and MTT assay was performed on day 15. Cell viability of CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells decreased with higher concentration of PFD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 compared to the control conditions. C. We cultured CAFs derived from HCI-002 TNBC xenograft tumors. Immunofluorescence of the cultured CAFs used an anti-collagen I (green) antibody. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. Collagen production was decreased by PFD.PFD inhibited growth of mouse CAFs isolated from the TNBC xenograft tumors in 2D culture (Supplementary Figure S3B). We then dissociated TNBC xenografts and sorted them into CD49f+ (tumor) and CD49f\u2212 (mainly stroma) cell population by flow cytometry. Cell viability of both CD49f+ and CD49f\u2212 cells, as measured by the MTT assay, decreased with increasing concentrations of PFD (Figure 3B). Since those cells did not proliferate in the assay, this result indicates that PFD promotes cell death. In addition, PFD inhibited collagen production by mouse CAFs (Figure 3C). These results show that PFD is an effective regulator of both CAF viability and collagen production in culture.PFD inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsSince CAFs can promote cancer progression, we examined the effects of PFD on tumor-stromal interaction in 3D co-culture assays of the mouse CAFs (see Supplementary Figure S2C) and 4T1 cells. We observed that CAFs enhanced tumor growth. Interestingly, PFD had little inhibitory effect on the 4T1 tumor without CAFs, but strongly inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs (Figure 4A). We then characterized the nature of the inhibition by immunofluorescence of tumor cells and CAFs in the 3D co-culture. Using phospho-histone H3 and cleaved caspase-3 antibodies we observed that PFD induced apoptosis of both tumor and CAFs (Figure 4B), but did not inhibit tumor cell mitosis (Supplementary Figure S4).Pirfenidone inhibits TNBC growth induced by CAFsWe cultured CAFs derived from TNBC xenograft tumors (HCI-001), and 3D co-culture assayed the CAFs and aggregated 4T1 cells (tumor cluster) in Matrigel. A. We examined the effects of PFD (triplicate). CAFs increased the tumor cluster size and PFD inhibited the size increased by CAFs (left panel). Also, CAFs increased the number of tumor clusters and PFD decreased the tumor cluster number increased by CAFs (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.05 or ***p<0.02 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs). B. We conducted immunofluorescence of the 3D Matrigel cultures by using anti-pan-cytokeratin (pCK, green, left panel), anti-vimentin (Vim, red, middle panel) and cleaved caspase-3 (cCSP3, red, left and green, middle panels, respectively) antibodies. DAPI (blue) stained nuclei. 4T1 tumor cells expressed both pan-cytokeratin and vimentin, and CAFs expressed vimentin. Therefore, pan-cytokeratin+ cells were 4T1 cells, and vimentin+ cells were either 4T1 cells or CAFs. Double-negative cells were regarded as other cell type. We counted the numbers of those cells (except 4T1 tumor clusters) with cleaved caspase-3 (representative photographs in left and middle panels) and quantified each apoptotic cells (right panel). We found that PFD induced apoptosis of 4T1 tumor cells and CAFs. C. We examined the effects of a TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor (SB431542) in the 3D co-culture assay (triplicate). PFD decreased the tumor cluster size (left panel) and the tumor cluster number (right panel). *p<0.05 compared to tumor (0 \u03bcM). **p<0.01 compared to 0 \u03bcM (Tumor + CAFs).Since TGF-\u03b2 is important for the tumor-stromal interaction and PFD can inhibit TGF-\u03b2, we hypothesized that TGF-\u03b2 inhibition by PFD is the mechanism of the suppressive interaction. We found that a specific TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, SB431542, inhibited the tumor growth induced by CAFs, but not growth without CAFs in the same 3D co-culture assay (Figure 4C). Those findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth by targeting TGF-\u03b2 in tumor-stromal interaction.PFD inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe next tested the effects of PFD on TNBC in vivo using the 4T1 mouse model. Prior to in vivo experiments, we verified that CAFs from 4T1 homograft tumors enhanced tumor growth, while PFD inhibited the tumor growth induced by the CAFs in 3D co-culture assay (Supplementary Figure S5A). We then transplanted 4T1 cells and CAFs into the mammary glands of BALB/c mice. We administered PFD (50 mg/kg) or water orally two times per day. We also tested the interaction of PFD treatment with chemotherapy by injecting doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) in the tail vein on days 0 and 19. While PFD alone did not inhibit the primary tumor growth (Figure 5A), doxorubicin alone inhibited primary tumor growth, and PFD together with doxorubicin inhibited tumor growth synergistically (Figure 5A). PFD or doxorubicin alone did not reduce the number of lung metastatic tumors (Figure 5B). However, PFD in combination with doxorubicin inhibited lung metastasis significantly (Figure 5B). In a second experimental protocol, we administered an increased concentration of PFD (100 mg/kg) two times per day in combination with doxorubicin and found an even more marked decrease in lung metastatic tumor numbers and weight compared to control (Supplementary Figure S5B).Pirfenidone inhibits primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in combination with doxorubicin in TNBC mouse modelWe transplanted 4T1 cells (1x104) and 4T1-stimulated CAFs (2x104) into mammary glands of BALB/c mice (n=5-6). PFD (50 mg/kg) or water was orally administered two times per day and doxorubicin (4 mg/kg) or PBS was injected from the mouse tail vain on day 0 and 19. A. Representative photographs of primary tumors after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Tumor volume (mm3) was measured by \u201cV=0.52xW2xL.\u201d W=width (mm), L=length (mm). PFD had no effect on primary tumor growth, but inhibited the tumor growth synergistically in combination with doxorubicin. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001 (right panel). B. Representative photographs of lung after the treatments (Day 37) (left panel). Visible lung metastatic tumor numbers in five lobes were counted. PFD decreased the lung metastatic tumor numbers in combination with doxorubicin, but PFD monotherapy did not decrease the numbers. *p<0.02 (middle panel). Total lung weight was measured. PFD decreased tumor weight in combination with doxorubicin though PFD monotherapy did not decrease the weight. **p<0.002 (right panel). C. Representative photographs of primary tumors by picro-sirius red staining showed that doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited collagen accumulation in primary tumors (left panel). Collagen deposition visualized by picro-sirius red staining was quantified by using ImageJ software. n=3, *p<0.01, **p<0.02, ***p<0.05 (right panel). D. Primary tumors were immunostained with an anti-phospho-SMAD3 antibody (red). DAPI (blue) stained nuclei (left panel). Expression levels of phospho-SMAD3 were quantified by using ImageJ software. Doxorubicin enhanced and PFD inhibited phospho-SMAD3 levels in primary tumors. n=4, *p<0.02, **p<0.01 (right panel).We next determined the effect of PFD inhibition of CAFs on apoptosis, collagen accumulation and phospho-SMAD3 expression in the primary tumors. Although treatment of the mice with PFD had no effect on apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor cells (data not shown), it decreased CAFs significantly (Supplementary Figure S5C). Treatment of the mice with doxorubicin enhanced collagen accumulation (Figure 5C). However, treatment of the mice with PFD or PFD plus doxorubicin inhibited collagen accumulation significantly (Figure 5C). Phospho-SMAD3 expression levels paralleled the collagen accumulation levels (Figure 5D). Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with chemotherapy with doxorubicin may overcome the activation of TGF-\u03b2 and enhance therapeutic effects of treatment for TNBC. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway with PFD in combination with doxorubicin can inhibit tumor-stromal interaction, collagen accumulation and suppress TNBC progression.DISCUSSIONThe importance of the microenvironment for the response to cancer therapy is an emerging field. While many studies have targeted angiogenesis and inflammation/immune function, several investigations recently have focused on stromal collagenous extracellular matrix and CAFs as potential targets. In this study, we showed that PFD inhibited tumor growth of TNBC in vitro by targeting CAFs. In vivo, PFD inhibited the tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically in combination with doxorubicin.We observed that mouse CAFs promoted tumor progression in vitro and in vivo as previously reported. This occurred in both PDX models in NOD/SCID immunosuppressed mice and 4T1 tumors in immunosufficient Balb/C mice. TGF-\u03b2 signaling was activated both in the tumor cells and the stroma of the xenograft tumors (Figure 1C). This is in keeping with previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in fibroblasts is important to promote tumor growth. Since 4T1 cells express high levels of TGF-\u03b2, it is likely that tumor-induced TGF-\u03b2 promoted transformation of mouse fibroblasts into CAFs in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that PFD, which inhibits TGF-\u03b2, promoted cell death and suppressed collagen production in cultured CAFs, as seen previously in in vitro studies of fibroblasts.Our 3D co-culture assays show that PFD strongly inhibited tumor growth promoted by CAFs but had little inhibitory effect on tumor growth without CAFs. These findings suggest that PFD inhibits TNBC growth more effectively by targeting tumor-stromal interaction than by targeting the tumor itself. PDGF-A and HGF are also reported to be molecular targets of PFD for pancreatic tumor-stromal interactions. However, we focused on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in TNBC progression and found that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and promoted tumor growth. While SB431542, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonist, inhibited the tumor growth promoted by CAFs, it did not inhibit tumor growth without CAFs. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 pathway regulated by CAFs is a molecular target of PFD.PFD monotherapy at 50 mg/kg in mice (equivalent to the dose used in human) inhibited the CAF number significantly and tumor fibrosis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling strongly, but had no effect on tumor growth or lung metastasis. Since TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors can suppress primary tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, it is possible that PFD monotherapy might inhibit cancer progression at a higher dose. Indeed, 500 mg/kg/day of PFD monotherapy suppresses the growth of pancreatic tumors transplanted with stellate cells orthotopically into mice. Whether this effect occurs in other tumor types or at other doses has yet to be determined.Doxorubicin has antitumor activities by the disruption of topoisomerase-II-mediated DNA repair and the generation of free radicals and also activates TGF-\u03b2 signaling (Figure 5D and). In clinical treatment for breast cancer, doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) is administered intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Since we observed that doxorubicin monotherapy inhibited primary tumor growth but not lung metastasis of TNBC, our data support the hypothesis that activation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by doxorubicin can lead to collagen accumulation but cannot suppress lung metastasis. However, the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD inhibited primary tumor growth synergistically and lung metastasis significantly as seen previously for doxorubicin in combination with a competitive TGF-\u03b2 RI inhibitor. We suggest that simultaneous inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 by PFD along with TGF-\u03b2 activation as well as antitumor activities by doxorubicin may be important as mechanisms of synergistic effects of the combination therapy. Interestingly, chemotherapy-induced TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation and TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors prevent the development of drug-resistant cancer stem-like cells in TNBC. TGF-\u03b2 promotes breast cancer cell outgrowth from dormancy in metastatic sites, and our PDX models implicate TGF-\u03b2 signaling activation in metastasis-initiating cells, suggesting that combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have additional inhibitory effects on metastasis-initiating cells.Since the combination therapy of doxorubicin and PFD may have inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth and metastasis, it has great potential for a novel clinically applicable TNBC therapy that targets tumor-stromal interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSMouse transplantation modelsAll animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the UCSF IACUC. Mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the UCSF barrier facility. PDX tumor tissues from TNBC patients were acquired from the laboratory of A. Welm and engrafted in the mammary glands of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories). After the engrafted tumors grew, they removed and cells separated for CAF culture.We transplanted 4T1-GFP TNBC cells into cleared mammary fat pads of BALB/c mice (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc.). After three weeks, mammary tissues near the tumors were isolated, digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for culture. Cells grew in 2 weeks and GFP\u2212 cells (CAFs) were isolated by flow cytometry to remove the contaminated 4T1-GFP tumor cells. 4T1 cells (1x104) without or with the CAFs (2x104) were injected in a 10-\u03bcl volume of 1:1 v/v Matrigel:DMEM/F12 medium into the inguinal mammary glands of BALB/c mice. Two dose protocols were used as indicated: 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg pirfenidone (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Pirfenex) was orally administered two times a day. 4 mg/kg doxorubicin (LC Laboratories) or PBS was injected into the mouse tail vain on days 0 and 19 in the first protocol and on day 1 and 23 in the second protocol. Tumor volumes (mm3) were calculated using the formula: V\u2009=\u20090.52\u00d7W2\u00d7L. W=width (mm), L=length (mm).Cell culturePirfenidone (Sigma-Aldrich #P2166) was used for in vitro experiments. Tumor specimens of breast cancer patients from UCSF Medical Center (courtesy of Dr. H. Rugo) and xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase I and IV and trypsin, and plated on dishes for CAF culture. CAFs were grown in ACL4 + 5% FBS medium. The cells were stained with trypan blue to detect live and dead cells.MDA-MB231 cells were obtained from UCSF Cell Culture Facility. Murine TNBC 4T1 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and labeled with GFP for transplantation. The cells were fixed with 4% PFA for immunocytochemistry.HistologyTumor and lung tissues were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and paraffin processed. We cut 5-\u03bcm sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for routine histology. Picrosirius red staining was performed as previously described and fibrillar collagen visualized using crossed polarizers.Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below.3D assayMammary glands of FVB/n mice were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The single MECs or 4T1 cells (5 x 104 per well) were aggregated overnight on ultralow attachment plates (Corning). The aggregated MECs or the aggregated 4T1 cells + CAFs (2.5 x 104 per well) were embedded into growth-factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and grown in serum-free media supplemented with insulin-transferrin (Invitrogen) and 2.5nM FGF2 (Sigma) as previously described. SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich), a potent and selective inhibitor of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors, and pirfenidone (P2166) were used for 3D assay. 3D Matrigel was fixed with methanol/acetone at \u221220\u00b0C and embedded into OCT for frozen sections.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence of fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, fixed cells and frozen sections of fixed cultures in Matrigel was performed using the following antibodies at the indicated concentrations: phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling #3101, 1:50), phospho-SMAD3 (Cell Signaling #9520, 1:50), TGF-\u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc146, 1:50), pan-cytokeratin (Sigma-Aldrich #C2562, 1:500), vimentin (Sigma #V5255, 1:200), human specific vimentin [V9] (Abcam #ab8069, 1:100), fibroblast activation protein (FAP) alpha (Abcam #ab53066, 1:200), alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) Cy3 conjugate (Sigma #C6198, 1:250), collagen I (Novus Biologicals #NB100-92161, 1:100), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling #9661, 1:200), phospho-histone H3 (Cell Signaling #9701, 1:100), goat anti-mouse IgM \u03bc chain Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-166-075, 1:200), Alexa 488 anti-mouse, 488 anti-rabbit, 568 anti-rabbit, 647 anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes A24920, A24922, A21069, A21245, 1:500). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories H-1200). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Nikon C1si confocal microscope.Flow cytometry analysis and cell sortingTNBC xenograft tumors were digested with collagenase. Organoids were collected by brief centrifugation and digested with trypsin to dissociate into single cells. The cells were stained with antibodies against CD49f and EpCAM (eBioscience) for flow cytometry as described previously. Cell sorting was performed on FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and analysed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences).Cell viability assayCell viability was measured using the CellTiter MTT Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Sorted cells were plated in triplicate and incubated with PFD for 15 days, and attenuance at 590nm was read on sequential days using a plate reader (Bio-Rad).Lung metastasis analysisTo determine whether CAFs increased lung metastatic tumor frequency in vivo, lung tissue blocks were sectioned into 5-\u03bcm sections and stained by H&E. For each mouse analyzed, one section was scored for number of metastases per lobe. To test the effects of PFD on lung metastasis in vivo, lungs were harvested from each mouse, and then the weight was measured and the visible tumor number was counted.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was conducted using Prism 4 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Statistical significance between two groups was calculated using Student's t test and P values lower than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare

        "content": "Tumor growth and invasion occurs through a dynamic interaction between cancer and stromal cells, which support an aggressive niche. MicroRNAs are thought to act as tumor messengers to \"corrupt\" stromal cells. We previously demonstrated that miR-9, a known metastamiR, is released by triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to enhance the transition of normal fibroblasts (NFs) into cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 (<iEFEMP1</i), which encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, emerged as a miR-9 putative target upon miRNA's exogenous upmodulation in NFs.

MicroRNAs are thought to act as tumor messengers to \u201ccorrupt\u201d stromal cells. We previously demonstrated that miR-9, a known metastamiR, is released by triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to enhance the transition of normal fibroblasts (NFs) into cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-like cells. EGF containing fibulin extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1), which encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, emerged as a miR-9 putative target upon miRNA\u2019s exogenous upmodulation in NFs. Here we explored the impact of EFEMP1 downmodulation on fibroblast\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like features, and how this phenotype influences neoplastic cells to gain chemoresistance. Indeed, upon miR-9 overexpression in NFs, EFEMP1 resulted downmodulated, both at RNA and protein levels. The luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 and its silencing recapitulates miR-9-induced pro-tumoral phenotype in fibroblasts. In particular, EFEMP1 siRNA-transfected (si-EFEMP1) fibroblasts have an increased ability to migrate and invade. Moreover, TNBC cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 became more resistant to cisplatin. Overall, our results demonstrate that miR-9/EFEMP1 axis is crucial for the conversion of NFs to CAF-like cells under TNBC signaling.1. IntroductionThe physiological role of stromal cells like fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes and immune cells is to sustain and shield epithelial cells from harm. Breast cancer, as other solid tumors, must engage stromal cells in an aberrant cross-talk in order to grow, invade the neighboring tissues, and migrate to distant sites. For example, \u201ccorrupted\u201d fibroblasts, the so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), actively secrete pro-tumor factors like growth factors, cytokines and chemokines, remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) to favor tumor cell motility and, eventually, mediate resistance to anticancer drugs. CAFs are also able to affect the behavior of the other stromal cells, for instance by releasing pro-inflammatory chemokines and pro-angiogenic factors that facilitate the immune and endothelial cell recruitment at the tumor site and the polarization toward a malignant phenotype.Triple-negative breast cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is thought to have a unique microenvironment, distinct from other breast cancer subtypes, which might significantly impact on the progression of these malignances.An increasing body of evidence supports the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the interaction between tumor and stroma. Indeed miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation, have been proven to act as \u201cmessages\u201d to induce the acquisition of malignant traits in stromal cells. Accordingly, in our previous work by Baroni S et al., we demonstrated that TNBC cells are able to induce the acquisition of CAF-like properties in NFs by releasing the known breast metastamiR miR-9, packaged into exosomes. We also showed that these CAF-like cells can increase, in turn, tumor cell aggressiveness. Gene expression profile of miR-9 overexpressing NFs revealed EFEMP1, collagen type1 alpha1 (COL1A1) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), as the most significantly modulated genes, being the first two transcripts predicted miR-9 targets. These molecules were selected for further analyses since they are known to be involved in the crucial pathways of ECM synthesis and remodelling. However, since only EFEMP1 downmodulation was validated in public datasets comparing tumor vs normal stroma of breast cancer patients, we decided to focus our efforts on studying EFEMP1 contribution to the observed phenotype.EFEMP1 encodes for the ECM glycoprotein fibulin-3, which participates in maintaining the integrity of the stroma linking elastic fibres to basement membranes. Interestingly, in 2015 Tian H et al. identified fibulin-3 as a novel TGF-\u03b2 pathway inhibitor in breast cancer microenvironment, interfering with tumor progression. Here we focus on validating EFEMP1 targeting by miR-9 in fibroblasts and explore the contribution of this modulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features, such as cell motility and induction of chemoresistance in TNBC cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. In-Silico Analysis to Define Caf and NF EFEMP1 Expression PortraitsNormalized gene expression profiles of GSE20086, GSE80035 and GSE37614 were downloaded from Geo omnibus. Genes were annotated with biomaRt package from Bioconductor in R environment. Duplicated probes for a same gene were collapsed by selecting the one with the highest interquartile range for Affymetrix profiling, while the probe with the highest value was selected for further analyses on Illumina profiles. Plots were performed with ggplot. Wilcoxon test was applied to define differential expression on R.2.2. Cell Culture and Primary Fibroblasts IsolationImmortalized normal fibroblasts, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA). NFs were cultured in FGM-2 medium with 10% FBS, HEK-293T and MDA-MB-468 in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2. MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) was used to assure a negative mycoplasma status in cultured cells before experiments were started. Primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from specimen belonging to TNBC patient who underwent surgery at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan (INT) and who signed an informed consent to donate the leftover tissue after diagnosis to INT for research. The INT Ethic Committee authorized the use of these samples for the project \u201cTumor-microenvironment related changes as new tools for early detection and assessment of high-risk disease\u201d on January 24th 2012. RNA from these samples was isolated as previously described.2.3. MiRNA Mimics and siRNA Transient TransfectionMiR-9 overexpression was performed using a chemically synthesized miRNA mimic (Catalog number AM17100, Assay ID PM10022, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a final concentration of 100 nM. A Silencer\u00ae Select Pre-Designed siRNA (Catalog number AM16708, Assay ID 14094 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was purchased to perform EFEMP1 silencing, using a final concentration of 50 nM. Lipofectamine 2000 was used as transfection reagent in Optimem medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), which was replaced with standard medium after 6 h.2.4. Cloning and MutagenesisEFEMP1 3\u2032UTR was cloned into pmirGLO vector plasmid (Promega, Medison, WI, USA), designed to perform luciferase reporter assay and carrying \u03b2-lactamase coding region (Ampicillin resistance). EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence to be cloned was amplified by PCR using ThermoScientific Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Primer sequences are reported in Table 1. Plasmid vector and insert were first digested with NheI and XbaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) through incubation for 1h at 37 \u00b0C. The digested products were purified with Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction kit, dephosphorylated with rAPid Alkaline Phosphatase kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) through incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 2 min at 75 \u00b0C and then ligated using Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), with samples incubated for 5 min at 20 \u00b0C. As a negative control, the same reaction was performed without insert addition. One ShotTM TOP10 chemically competent E. Coli cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were transformed, through heat-shock, with either the ligation product or the negative control, and plated on Agar plates with LB medium and ampicillin. Few resistant colonies were incubated in LB selective medium for 8 h. A backup plate for the selected colonies was stored at 4 \u00b0C. Plasmid DNA was extracted with EuroGOLD plasmid Miniprep kit (Euroclone, Pero, MI, Italy) and sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Vimodrone, MI, Italy) to check proper cloning using the primers in Table 2. Plasmid DNA with the correct integrated insert was amplified starting from the corresponding backup colonies and extracted with NucleoBondXtra Midi Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany).The plasmid DNA containing the cloned EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR sequence was used to generate pmiRGLO plasmids carrying a mutated form of the miR-9 target site, using GENEART Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed to be used as templates in the mutagenesis reaction (Table 3). Plasmid DNA was extracted from six random grown colonies and sequenced to check for mutated products.2.5. Luciferase Reporter Assay3 \u00d7 105 HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and co-transfected with 500 ng pmirGLO vector plasmid carrying either the wild-type or the mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR and 100 nM miR-9 precursor or negative control, using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell lysates were collected 24 h post transfection and Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase was normalized on Renilla luciferase and the reporter activity was finally expressed as relative activity between cells silenced for miR-9 and the corresponding control.2.6. Motility AssaysMigration and invasion assays were performed using Transwell Permeable Support 8.0 \u03bcm (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA). 1 \u00d7 105 transfected cells in 300 \u03bcL of FBS-free medium were seeded in the upper chamber; for invasion, 50 \u03bcL of Matrigel (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) was added at the bottom of the upper chamber. 10% FBS enriched medium was added to the lower chamber as chemoattractant. After an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C, migrated/invaded cells were fixed with 100% cold ethanol, stained with 0.4% Sulforhodamine B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) and captured in photos (4 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). For wound-healing assays, 1 \u00d7 105 transfected fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates. When confluent, cells were removed in the middle of the well with a plastic tip. Images of the wound were captured at this moment and after 48 h (2 images per well, 10\u00d7 magnification). All images were captured using EVOS XL Core Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and processed with ImageJ informatic program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).2.7. Protein Extraction and Western BlotWhole cell lysates were prepared using NTG buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and activated orthovanadate (1:50). Bradford assay with CoomassiePlus Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to quantify the total proteins at Ultrospec 2100 pro (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) spectrophotometer. 30 \u00b5g total protein were electrophoretically separated on NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris Gel (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Western blot analyses were performed with primary antibodies: anti-\u03b2-actin peroxidase-linked (1:30,000, clone: AC-15, catalog number: A3854, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA); anti-fibulin-3 (1:200, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA); anti-e-cadherin (1:200, clone: G-10, catalog number: sc-8426 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and the corresponding secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti-rabbit peroxidase-linked (1:5000 and 1:10,000, respectively, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The signals were visualized by ECLTM Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The quantification of protein bands was performed by Quantity One 1-D Analysis (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).2.8. ImmunohistochemistryIHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels was performed on tumor samples collected from the in vivo experiment illustrated in the work by Baroni et al., 2016 (11) (6 samples per experimental condition). Tissue sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated and heated for 5 min at 95 \u00b0C in citrate buffer (4:1 sodium citrate (10 mM, pH 8) and citric acid (5 mM); final pH 6). Peroxidase blocking was achieved with 15 min incubation in 80% methanol and 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with Protein Block Serum-Free (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in BSA 1%. Slides were then incubated at room temperature for 1h with a mouse monoclonal anti-fibulin-3 antibody (1:100, clone: C-3, catalog number: sc-365224, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and then with Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:100, Dako) for 45 min. Antibodies were diluted in \u201cDako real antibody diluition\u201d (Dako products, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Follows HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:300) for 30 min, DAB (1:50 in HRP substrate buffer) staining for 5 min and mayer\u2019s hematoxylin counterstaining for 10 s. Sections were finally dehydrated and mounted. A positivity score ranging from 0 to 2 was assigned to each tumor, having 0 for no signal, 1 for intermediate positivity and 2 for high positivity.2.9. Tumor Cell Conditioning and Resistance TestOn the first day, 4.5 \u00d7 105 immortalized fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h, NFs were transfected with either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 and controls, and 3 \u00d7 105 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 6-wells plates. On the third day, MDA-MB-468 cells were conditioned with the medium of transfected NFs and then treated (or not) with Cisplatin (5 \u03bcM) after 24 h. The drug was added in fresh medium. On day 5, cell viability was assessed by cell counting.2.10. Mining Data to Evaluate Correlation of MiR-9 Expression and Cisplatin ResponsePublicly available data from TNBC data sets with available matched mRNA-miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (GDC TCGA Breast Cancer RNA counts) were downloaded from the Xena browser, while normalized data from METABRIC study were recovered through cBiportal, together with our in house cohort (SubSeries GSE86948). Genes from each platform were annotated with biomaRt and only common cross-platform genes were selected for further analysis. TCGA data were downloaded as raw counts and processed with limma-voom in limma R package. Normalized data were scaled by median-absolute-deviation (MAD) for each sample. For TCGA miRNA expression profiles, TPM data was downloaded from TCGA BRCA cohort in XENA.Gene expression signatures were explored for their correlation with the CAF populations identified by dedicated metagenes reported by Bartoschek M et al.. The included endothelial/microvasculature signature, stroma-related signature and microvasculature signature. Gene signature scores were computed as the averages of mean centred expression of all these gene members of each signature. For each metagene, correlation patterns were compacted using Pearson correlation.3. Results3.1. In-Silico Evaluation of EFEMP1 Levels in CAFsAiming at investigating EFEMP1 role in the conversion of normal to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the breast cancer microenvironment, we analyzed its expression level in six matched paired NFs/CAFs obtained from breast malignances (two grade III, three grade II and one grade I; GSE20086). Figure 1a illustrates the significant downregulation of EFEMP1 in CAFs vs. their matched NFs.Moreover, since breast cancer is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease, to gain a better understanding of these complexities we analyzed EFEMP1 expression in public profiles of human dermal fibroblasts conditioned with three breast cancer cell line models (GSE80035). Relevantly, fibroblasts conditioned with TNBC (MDA-MB-468) and HER2+ (SkBr3) cells presented a lower EFEMP1 expression than Luminal A ER+/PR+/HER2+ (T-47D) cells (Figure 1b). In support of these observations, CAFs isolated from human TNBC tumors (GSE37614) presented a lower expression of EFEMP1 in comparison to other tumor subtypes (Figure 1c). These data are strengthened by the result of qRT-PCR analysis of EFEMP1 expression in a couple of NFs/CAFs from a TNBC patient, illustrated in Figure S1.Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 downmodulation is linked to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype in tumor-associated fibroblasts, which seems to be particularly relevant in TNBC subtype.3.2. MiR-9 Directly Targets EFEMP1 and Affects Protein Levels In Vitro and In VivoEncouraged by the in-silico results, we proceeded assessing EFEMP1 expression in our normal fibroblast in vitro model (NFs) at mRNA and protein level, upon miR-9 transfection, by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. As shown in Figure 2a,b, EFEMP1 and fibulin-3 levels decreased in miR-9 overexpressing NFs (NFs miR-9) compared to control (NFs miR-NEG).Fibulin-3 is a secreted protein and it exerts its main activity as anchoring element in the stroma. In order to verify miR-9-induced EFEMP1 downmodulation in this cellular compartment, we performed an IHC analysis on tumor samples from our previous in vivo experiment. Particularly, it was monitored the in vivo tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells co-injected in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice with NFs transfected with miR-9 (NFs/miR-9) or negative control (NFs/miR-neg), which resulted increased in MDA-MB-468 cells and NFs/miR-9 group. Thus, evaluating fibulin-3 expression in tumor samples from mice injected with MDA-MB-468 and NFs/ miR-9 compared to negative control, we observed a lower expression of this protein in the tumor stroma (Figure 2c and Figure S2a). Since MDA-MB-468 and NFs/miR-9 mice developed bigger tumors compared to negative control, it is reasonable to hypothesize an anti-oncogenic role for this ECM protein in the TNBC stroma.Even though a slight decrease in fibulin-3 levels was observed also in some of the tumor nodules in the MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 group, no modulation of EFEMP1/fibulin-3 expression was detected in MDA-MB-468 cells overexpressing miR-9 in in vitro experiments (Figure S2b). We evaluated e-cadherin as positive control since it has been already validated as miR-9 target in tumor cells. Thus, these results suggest that EFEMP1 is not a miR-9 target in this cell model.In order to check whether EFEMP1 regulation by miR-9 in fibroblasts is due to a direct targeting, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Wild-type or mutated EFEMP1 3\u2032UTR were cloned downstream the luciferase gene and co-transfected with miR-9 or control in HEK-293T cells. As illustrated in Figure 2d, we observed a significant reduction of the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the wild-type construct in the presence of miR-9, compared to control. This effect was lost when the mutated 3\u2032UTR was tested.3.3. EFEMP1 Silencing Recapitulates miR-9-Induced CAF-Like Features in Normal FibroblastsTo evaluate the contribution of EFEMP1 downmodulation to the acquisition of CAF-like features upon miR-9 targeting, we first performed migration and invasion assays. Normal fibroblasts were transfected with siRNA targeting EFEMP1 (si-EFEMP1) or with a negative control (si-NEG). As shown in Figure 3a,b, EFEMP1 knockdown significantly increased fibroblast motility. Specifically, at 24h, a +15% of cells migrated to the bottom chamber of the transwell, while +28% of cells invaded the Matrigel upon EFEMP1 silencing, compared to control. In order to better appreciate si-EFEMP1 phenocopy of miR-9 effect, we decided to perform a wound healing assay on fibroblasts transfected in parallel with miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 vs. each respective control. Figure 3c shows that both miR-9 overexpression and EFEMP1 silencing increased fibroblasts ability to \u201cheal the wound\u201d, evaluated 48h after the scratch. For each experiment, transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR (Figure S3). Thus, we demonstrated that EFEMP1 silencing partially mimics miR-9 action in NFs, leading to the acquisition of CAF-like features.3.4. CAF-Like Properties Induced by miR-9/si-EFEMP1-Transfection Reduce MDA-MB-468 Cell Sensitivity to CisplatinIt is well known that CAFs can also affect tumor cell responsiveness to treatment by triggering multiple escape mechanisms. For instance, Figure S4 shows EFEMP1 mRNA pattern among CAFs isolated from tumors of sensitive and resistant breast cancer patients before neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. CAFs from resistant patients exhibited slightly lower EFEMP1 mRNA levels than sensitives. Since platinum-based therapy is an effective treatment for a subset of TNBCs, we then decided to evaluate the ability of miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells to affect tumor cell sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells were chosen among the available TNBC cell lines considering their sensitivity to this compound and our existing expertise with this cell model.Tumor cells were conditioned for 24 h with the supernatant of NFs miR-9/si-EFEMP1 or controls, and then treated with cisplatin (5 \u00b5M, IC50 concentration) for 24h. When we challenged the tumor cells with cisplatin, we observed a 15% increase in MDA-MB-468 cell viability upon conditioning with NFs miR-9 supernatant, compared with control conditions (Figure 4a,b). Transfection efficiencies related to this experiment are shown in Figure S5a.It is worth noting that we detected an increase in miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs miR-9 (Figure S5b). This could be due to miR-9 uptake by MDA-MB-468 cells from NF medium. However, a slight but significant miR-9 upmodulation was also seen in treated control cells, compared to the non-treated counterpart, suggesting an additional action of the treatment alone on tumor miR-9 levels. Further studies should be performed to investigate the biological meaning of these data.This evidence demonstrates the relevance of miR-9/EFEMP1 axis on the transition of NFs phenotype to CAF-like, which, in turn, promotes chemoresistance in TNBC.3.5. Characterization of miR-9/CAF Axis on TNBC Biology and Chemotherapy Response by Mining mRNA and miRNA Expression DataTo further analyze whether miR-9/CAF axis on TNBC is related with cisplatin treatment response we analyzed the transcriptional landscape on TNBC and public available signatures. Recently, single-cell resolution analysis revealed the existence of at least two spatially and functionally subsets of breast CAFs: (1) vascular CAFs (vCAFs), enriched in vascular development and angiogenesis signaling pathways and (2) matrix CAFs (mCAF), endowed in matrix-related genes and stroma-related treatment-predictive signatures.To further identify functionally distinctive CAFs through reported molecular signatures we analyzed the transcriptional landscape of TNBC from the public data sets TCGA and METABRIC, as well as an in-house profiled cohort (GSE86948) composed of mRNA-miRNA matched expression profiles (n = 342). Notably, on TCGA and GSE86948 datasets, a similar expression pattern of miR-9 was observed in matched normal adjacent tissue and tumor cells of TNBC patients (Figure S6a,b), suggesting a coordinate and correlated altered phenotype in both breast tissues (Figure S6c). Consequently, the tumoral miR-9 expression pattern is informative of the miRNA expression in the stroma comportment.We then sub-grouped TNBC data sets according to miR-9 level as following: miR-9 high (over 3rd Quantile), intermediate (Inter, >3rd Q and <1st Q) and low (<1st Q). We first set out to determine whether the observed CAF subtypes, detected by dedicated metagenes, are correlated with their inferred functions, including modulation of extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and angiogenesis (endothelial metagene) (Table S1). In keeping with reported data, the vCAF signature was highly correlated to an endothelial cell metagene (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.28 in mCAF) and microvascular signature (R = 0.61, p < 0.01 vs R = 0.3 in mCAF) (Figure S7a), whereas the mCAF signature was strongly associated with the ECM metagene (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.49 in vCAF) and stroma signature (R = 0.98, p < 0.01 vs 0.55 in vCAF) (Figure S7b).Furthermore, correlations within TNBC tumors were dependent on the miR-9 subgroup. Notably, the relations between CAFs and gene signatures in tumors with high or intermediate miR-9 expression strongly indicate that the functionality of both ECM and endothelial gene programs correlated with vCAFs and mCAFs. In contrast, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF (Figure 5a and Figure S7a,b). These specific correlated profiles further indicate the existence of different CAF subtypes in TNBC related with elevated miR-9 expression, and represent a strong support of the notion that miR-9 up-modulation modifies NFs, which in turn support malignant phenotypes and likely provide advantages against chemotherapy treatment.We therefore investigated whether miR-9 conveys sensitivity to therapy in human TNBC tumors. Relevantly, literature has reported that low BRCA1 mRNA expression is a factor associated with good cisplatin response. Thus, we examined BRCA1 gene expression in two well-characterized cohorts of patients with TNBC treated in neoadjuvant with cisplatin (GSE18864 and GSE103668). Patients with lower BRCA1 expression respond better to cisplatin treatment, compared to patients expressing moderate or high BRCA1 levels, evaluated by Miller\u2013Payne criteria (Figure 5b). This is consistent with the idea that \u201cBRCAness\u201d phenotype is characterized by a decreased BRCA1 expression. Relevantly, a similar BRCA1 expression pattern was observed in TNBC tumors sub-grouped by miR-9 expression; for instance, high and intermediate miR-9 category displayed a significantly higher BRCA1 expression. Together, these data provide independent evidence that miRNA signaling, other than prompting a fibroblast reprogramming, can also affect response to cisplatin, likely by modulating CAF/tumor interplay.4. DiscussionGiven the idea of a tumor tissue as \u201ca wound that never heals\u201d, the tumor microenvironment can also be chronically altered through a reciprocal tumor\u2013stroma signaling. Indeed, CAFs, which constitute the major component in the stroma, exert several pro-tumoral functions. It is generally accepted that CAFs, considered fibrotic myofibroblasts, have distinctive features, functions or location from normal fibroblasts, and contribute to establish and maintain the aggressiveness of the lesion.Approximately 80% of fibroblasts in breast cancer stroma acquires an aggressive phenotype; however, how such activation occurs is still not well understood. In our previous work, we unravelled one of the mechanisms engaged by TNBC cells to obtain fibroblast\u2019s support. We provided evidence that TNBC cells overexpressing miR-9 are able to release the miRNA into the stroma, where normal fibroblasts are able to incorporate it. Consequently, miR-9 perturbs the transcriptional landscape of the recipient cells, inducing a shift towards CAF malignant phenotype. The data presented here extended these findings and demonstrated that EFEMP1 downregulation, due to direct miR-9 regulation, is a relevant step in the malignant transformation of fibroblasts in the TNBC microenvironment. We also showed that EFEMP1 specific silencing in NFs partially recapitulates the CAF-like features triggered by miR-9 uptake, such as an increased ability to migrate and invade. Certainly, considering the common mechanism of action of microRNAs, able to finely tune several molecules to achieve a specific biological effect, it is conceivable that miR-9 has additional targets implicated in fibroblast\u2019s behaviour, and it would be interesting to explore other candidates.Another important oncogenic downstream effect of CAF reprogramming includes the impairment of chemotherapy efficacy. The mechanisms underlying this process still have to be fully elucidated, but the literature already provides interesting inputs. For example, CAFs can convey pro-survival cues to tumor cells, induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and stemness traits. Interestingly, in a dataset comparing gene expression of CAF from breast cancer patients resistant vs sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, EFEMP1 was found significantly downmodulated in the resistant group. Moreover, this CAF subgroup was associated to cancer stemness phenotype, a feature associated to disease aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy. It is interesting to note that Bartoschek and collaborators reported that the absolute number of CAFs in tumor tissues before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not statistically different between sensitive and resistant patients; instead the CAF subclasses defined in their study and also analysed in the present work are differentially operating in each tumor class and, relevantly, presented a distinctive correlation with miR-9 expression. In particular, correlation data of miR-9 overexpressing tumors (high an intermediate subgroups) and CAFs subsets pinpoint the functional differences driven by miR-9/ CAF axis. Indeed, in miR-9 overexpressing tumors ECM and endothelial gene programs correlate with both vCAFs and mCAFs, tumors with low miR-9 expression present a dependent relation of endothelial signature only in vCAF. Interestingly, mCAFs are highly associated with a stroma-derived invasion signature predictive of responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. Numerous clinical trials are currently revaluating cisplatin as chemotherapeutic option to treat TNBC, especially those harbouring a BRCA mutation. As expected, our data show that lower BRCA1 expression is found in cisplatin responder patients, compared to non-responders. BRCA1 expression analysis in TNBC tumors, sub-grouped on the basis of miR-9 expression, revealed that tumors with higher miR-9 expression in tumor or fibroblast compartment also over-expressed BRCA1, further supporting the correlation of high miR-9 expression to a chemo-resistance phenotype. Consistently, our in vitro experiments corroborate this hypothesis: miR-9/si-EFEMP1-induced CAF-like cells were able to impact on TNBC cell sensitivity to cisplatin. MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of either miR-9 or si-EFEMP1 transfected NFs resulted in a significant increment of viable cells after treatment, compared to control. Moreover, our data show a moderate increase of miR-9 levels in MDA-MB-468 cells conditioned with the supernatant of NFs transfected with miR-9. This event could be the result of either an uptake or/and an induction of the miRNA upon cell conditioning and contributes to the observed resistant phenotype. Indeed, a recent review reports a list of CAF-secreted miRNAs responsible of conferring cisplatin resistance in different tumor models, even though miR-9 was not reported. However, the reduction of sensitivity in conditioned tumor cells can also be caused by other multiple secreted factors rather than by a single molecule. Further studies should be performed to explore these mechanisms. Considering that TNBC patients still lack targeted therapies and rely only on standard chemotherapy, our data appear particularly relevant for future translational studies. The literature extensively suggests the perspective of depleting CAFs to ameliorate patient\u2019s prognosis, but no relevant results were obtained so far. Another proposed approach is the CAF reversion to a non-malignant phenotype. Since miR-9 was demonstrated to act on multiple targets, both in breast cancer and stromal cells, it would be advantageous to exploit this target for therapeutic purposes.Certainly, since one of the main concerns about a miRNA-derived therapy is the potential side effects, especially when considering a miRNA that seems to have contrasting roles in different tumor types and/or tissues, the most successful approach to overcome this issue would likely be to develop a tumor-specific delivery. Data in the literature regarding EFEMP1 expression in the tumor epithelium are also controversial: it was found downregulated in lung, nasopharyngeal, prostate, hepatocellular and glioma cancers, compared to normal tissue; on the contrary, it acts as oncogene in cervical, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. In breast cancer, EFEMP1 was found downmodulated in sporadic malignancies but there is also evidence of pro-tumor activities. Moreover, our qRT-PCR and western blot evaluation of EFEMP1 levels in miR-9 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells suggests that the fibulin is not a target of the miRNA in this cell line model.Furthermore, it is important to note that fibroblasts are the main secreting cell compartment of fibulin-3 in the stroma. The molecule exerts its principal activity as structural protein, although it is also known to induce and interact with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 TIMP-3, which inhibits metalloproteinases MMP2/9, highly expressed in breast cancers and actively involved in matrix remodelling. IHC evaluation of fibulin-3 levels in ex vivo samples suggests that a reduced expression of the protein in the stroma milieu could have provided an oncogenic advantage to MDA-MB-468 + NFs miR-9 tumors, given that this group grew significantly more than controls.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that miR-9 directly targets EFEMP1 in fibroblasts and that EFEMP1 downmodulation is important in determining NF\u2019s acquisition of CAF-like properties. Additional experiments are necessary to address the intriguing fibroblast-specific miR-9 targeting of EFEMP1 in tumoral cells. Our work sheds light on previously unknown mechanisms that define NFs reprogramming in TNBC and has significant therapeutic implications for patients with this tumor subtype.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1.

Compared with ER-positive or HER2-positive breast cancer, TNBC is associated with a high histologic grade, frequent distant metastasis, and high mortality rate. Although it has been intensively studied, the mechanism underlying the poor prognosis of TNBC remains to be elucidated.The WNT signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in tumorigenesis. WNT signaling is frequently activated in TNBC as opposed to other subtypes of breast cancer. Recent studies have established the transcription factor forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) as a pivotal diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), a subtype of breast cancer which is characterized by basal cytokeratin expression and shares many similar clinicopathologic traits with TNBC. Elevated FOXC1 expression is associated with a worse overall survival of breast cancer patients. In this study, we explored the FOXC1-associated mechanism underlying the invasiveness of TNBC cells. Our results show that WNT5A, a ligand that mediates non-canonical \u03b2-catenin-independent WNT signaling, was markedly induced by FOXC1 in TNBC cells. Upregulated WNT5A activated NF-\u03baB signaling, which in turn induced matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) expression. This WNT5A-NF-\u03baB-MMP7 axis elicited by FOXC1 is essential for the invasiveness of TNBC cells, and may be further exploited to develop new treatment for TNBC.Results and DiscussionWNT5A is up-regulated by FOXC1 in TNBC cellsBecause FOXC1 expression and WNT signaling are associated with TNBC, we tested whether FOXC1 regulates WNT pathways. Given that FOXC1 does not activate \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling in TNBC cells, we performed the WNT signaling pathway PCR array assay using control and FOXC1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 human TNBC cells to explore the potential effect of FOXC1 on WNT signaling in an unbiased manner. WNT ligands, WNT5A and WNT7A, and the WNT target gene MMP7 were significantly up-regulated in FOXC1-overexpressing cells, whereas VANGL2, a receptor of WNT ligands, was down-regulated (Fig. 1A). The up-regulation of WNT5A and MMP7 mRNA by FOXC1 was subsequently confirmed by PCR assays (Fig. 1B), but the expression of WNT7A and VANGL2 mRNA was undetectable in the same assays when testing different amplification cycles (Fig. 1B). This discrepancy might be caused by the extremely low endogenous levels of WNT7A and VANGL2 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells, which resulted in the very large variation of the Ct (cycle threshold) values in the PCR array assay (data not shown).Consistent with our results, earlier studies showed that MMP7 is up-regulated by FOXC1 and their expression is positively correlated with each other in breast cancer cells. WNT5A has also been shown to be expressed in TNBC samples. Here, we examined the association between the expression of FOXC1 and WNT5A in normal human mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, the expression of FOXC1 positively correlated with WNT5A in both mRNA and protein levels in breast cancer cells. This positive correlation was also observed in a microarray dataset of 51 breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1D). The regulation of WNT5A by FOXC1 was further confirmed in other TNBC cell lines, subgrouped by Lehmann et al. and Neve et al., except SUM149 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A\u2013C). Notably, FOXC1 induced WNT5A mRNA, but not protein expression in MDA-MB-468 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B). We speculate that the discrepancy between detected WNT5A protein and mRNA levels in MDA-MB-468 cells might be attributed to protein translation and stability, as well as secretion of WNT5A protein. The positive correlation between FOXC1 and WNT5A protein levels was further validated by immunohistochemistry assays performed in a TNBC tissue microarray (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these results demonstrate that WNT5A is up-regulated by FOXC1 in TNBC cells.Because MMP7 is a downstream target of tumor-associated macrophage-derived WNT5A, we tested whether FOXC1 induction of MMP7 is in fact mediated by WNT5A in TNBC. To do so, WNT5A was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 in FOXC1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1D). We found that the FOXC1-induced MMP7 gene expression was attenuated in the WNT5A-knockout cells (Fig. 1F). Moreover, the expression of MMP7 in BT549 and HCC1806 cells, which have high levels of endogenous FOXC1, was suppressed after knocking out FOXC1 and restored by recombinant WNT5A protein treatment (Fig. 1G; Supplementary Fig. 1A and E). These results suggest that MMP7 is regulated by a FOXC1-WNT5A signaling axis in TNBC cells.WNT5A promoter is activated by a FOXC1 transactivator complexTo test whether FOXC1 directly binds to the WNT5A promoter, we analyzed the sequence of the WNT5A promoter region and found two potential FOXC1-binding sites with the core consensus sequence of GTAAA (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, two 177bp fragments of the WNT5A promoter containing wild-type or mutant FOXC1-binding sites were cloned into a pGL4 reporter construct and luciferase reporter assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, FOXC1 dramatically increased WNT5A luciferase activity in TNBC cells. This result was further confirmed by a ChIP assay in which the WNT5A promoter fragment was enriched by an immunoprecipitation assay using an anti-FOXC1 antibody (Fig. 2C). To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which FOXC1 upregulates WNT5A transcription, we adopted the engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP) assay (Fig. 2D). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified proteins that bind to the WNT5A promoter together with FOXC1 (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Table 1). The interaction between FOXC1 and several representative proteins (i.e., KHSRP, HNRNPH1, TRIM28, and DDX5) from the proteomics analysis was further confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays (Co-IP) (Fig. 2F). ChIP assays also demonstrated the binding of the FOXC1-interacting proteins to the WNT5A promoter region containing FOXC1-binding sites (Fig. 2G). In addition, these binding interactions were enhanced when FOXC1 was increased (Fig. 2G). The binding of KHSRP and HNRNPH1 to the WNT5A promoter was also confirmed by biotinylated oligonucleotide precipitation assays (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Individual knockdown of these proteins reduced FOXC1-induced WNT5A mRNA expression to a varying extent (Fig. 2H and I). Taken together, these data suggest that FOXC1 binds directly to the promoter of WNT5A and collaborates with other nuclear proteins to induce WNT5A expression.Of note, some of the top enriched proteins have been shown to be involved in gene transcription. For example, ACTN4 can function as a transcriptional co-activator to promote the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. TRIM28 and ERH have been found to promote the accumulation of RNA polymerase II (PolII) to the transcriptional start site to initiate gene transcription. As a helicase, DDX5 can induce the recruitment of PolII to gene promoters to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation. Interestingly, KHSRP, HNRNPH1, PTBP1, and FUBP1 are heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (HNRNPs), which typically bind to pre-mRNA and participate in gene splicing. Recent studies suggest that HNRNPs may also bind to DNA to regulate gene transcription. For example, FUBP1 can bind to an upstream element of the c-MYC promoter to regulate c-MYC mRNA expression.WNT5A activates NF-\u03baB signaling in TNBC cellsWNT5A exerts its function mainly through activating \u03b2-catenin-independent signaling, which also has been observed in TNBC cells. However, it can simultaneously activate both \u03b2-catenin-independent and -dependent WNT signaling in TNBC cells to promote tumorigenicity. Since our previous study showed that FOXC1 does not activate \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling in TNBC cells, we next focused on the non-canonical pathways of WNT5A.WNT5A can activate PKC and JNK pathways to promote the invasiveness of melanoma and breast cancer cells, respectively. However, we found that FOXC1 did not induce but, rather reduced the phosphorylation levels of PKC and JNK in TNBC cells (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, FOXC1 increased SRC activation, which is partially dependent on WNT5A as WNT5A knockout reduced SRC activation (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. 3A). SRC is a well-known proto-oncogene that is involved in multiple aspects of tumorigenesis. We found that the SRC inhibitor Dasatinib showed no effect on the FOXC1-induced MMP7 expression (Supplementary Fig. 3B) despite inhibiting SRC phosphorylation in FOXC1-overexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 3C), suggesting SRC signaling is not involved in MMP7 induction by the FOXC1-WNT5A axis. The functions of the FOXC1-induced activation of SRC signaling in TNBC cells need to be further characterized.NF-\u03baB signaling, which is highly active in TNBC cells and can be activated by FOXC1, mediates the functions of WNT5A in human dental pulp cells, so we tested the involvement of NF-\u03baB signaling in the effect of FOXC1 on WNT5A in TNBC cells. We found that knocking out WNT5A impaired the FOXC1 induction of NF-\u03baB-responsive luciferase activity, and WNT5A treatment abolished this reduction (Fig. 3B). In line with these results, FOXC1 knockout inhibited the NF-\u03baB-responsive luciferase activity in HCC1806 cells, which was reversed by WNT5A treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3D). All these data suggest that FOXC1-induced WNT5A can activate NF-\u03baB signaling in TNBC cells. Next, we treated FOXC1-overexpressing TNBC cells with different concentrations of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor Bay 11-7082. As shown in Fig. 3C, inhibition of NF-\u03baB substantially lowered the FOXC1-induced MMP7 expression. Similar results were also found in HCC1806 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3E). Of note, expression of KHSRP, the top factor identified in the enChIP-proteomics assay (Fig. 2E), was not affected by Bay 11-7082 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3F), suggesting that the effect of Bay 11-7082 on MMP7 mRNA expression is selective. In agreement with the above results, p65 overexpression elevated MMP7 expression in WNT5A-KO TNBC cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. 3G). These data suggest that NF-\u03baB signaling mediates the effect of WNT5A on MMP7 expression in TNBC cells, which is supported by previous reports showing that NF-\u03baB regulates MMP7 expression in cholangiocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma cells.WNT5A mediates the FOXC1-induced invasiveness of TNBC cellsWNT5A has been shown to promote cancer cell migration and invasion and distant metastasis in many cancer subtypes. It can induce a mesenchymal phenotype and thus enhance the migration and invasion ability of human mammary epithelial cells. To test whether WNT5A mediates FOXC1-induced migration and invasion of TNBC cells, we first performed a wound healing assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, knocking out WNT5A significantly attenuated the migration of FOXC1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. This effect was further confirmed by the transwell migration assay (Fig. 4B). The Matrigel invasion assay also showed that WNT5A mediates FOXC1-induced invasion of TNBC cells (Fig. 4C). Of note, FOXC1-induced proliferation in TNBC cells was not affected by WNT5A knockout (Supplementary Fig. 4A).Because MMP7 is regulated by the FOXC1-WNT5A axis, we tested whether MMP7 mediates the effect of WNT5A on migration and invasion in TNBC cells. FOXC1+/WNT5A-KO MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different concentrations of the recombinant MMP7 protein. MMP7 treatment restored the WNT5A-KO-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion (Fig. 4D\u2013F), to different extents. In addition, the inhibition of migration and invasion was restored by WNT5A treatment in FOXC1-knockout HCC1806 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4B and C). We also knocked down MMP7 expression in FOXC1-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4G and H, MMP7 reduction dramatically suppressed cell migration and invasion, which was not affected by WNT5A treatment. Similar results were also found in HCC1806 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4E\u2013G). These data demonstrate the involvement of FOXC1-WNT5A-MMP7 signaling in regulating the invasiveness of TNBC cells.The effect of FOXC1-WNT5A-MMP7 signaling on TNBC cell invasiveness was further confirmed in vivo. Tail vein injection of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice showed that knocking out WNT5A inhibited the FOXC1-induced lung extravasation and metastasis, while MMP7 overexpression reversed this inhibition (Fig. 4I and J; Supplementary Fig. 4H and I). Matrix metalloproteinase proteins have been shown to be involved in tumor progression in multiple processes, including cell migration and invasion. MMP7 is highly expressed in BLBC/TNBC compared with other breast cancer subtypes. Based on previous and our present findings, we herein propose that a FOXC1-WNT5A-MMP7 signaling axis plays an important role in the migration, invasion, and distant metastasis of TNBC cells.In summary, our study reveals a novel FOXC1-mediated regulatory mechanism of non-canonical WNT5A signaling pathways in TNBC. This WNT5A-NF-\u03baB-MMP7 signaling is essential for FOXC1-induced invasiveness of TNBC cells (Fig. 4K), suggesting new interventional strategies to inhibit and treat metastasis of TNBC.Supplementary MaterialDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interests.Authors\u2019 ContributionsConception and design by BC Han and XJ Cui.

We found that saturated fat induced lineage plasticity reprogramming of PCa by interaction with CAF through Wnt5a and Hh signaling.1. IntroductionProstate cancer is expected to reach approximately 2 million new cases by 2040, with the United States (US) having the highest incidence rate of prostate cancer (PCa) worldwide. A high-fat diet and obesity are identified as important drivers of disease progression and accelerated patient mortality. Since a third of the US population is categorized as obese, the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon require immediate attention. The ingestion of a high-fat diet is associated with the elevated circulation of free fatty acids. Palmitic acid (palmitate) is a common saturated long-chain fatty acid and a significant component of the Western-style diet that is metabolized to cholesterol by the prostate and other organs, including the liver. Liver and breast cancers are among the many diseases particularly associated with the elevated oxidative stress resulting from palmitate consumption. We investigated the impact of palmitate and cholesterol supplementation on the interaction between PCa epithelia and prostate-cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF).Cholesterol signaling has been associated with cancer development, organogenesis, and progression through the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The contribution of Hh signaling to the regulation of cancer stemness and invasiveness has been demonstrated in many cancer types, including prostatic, pancreatic, ovarian, and colorectal. The connection of Hh signaling and SOX2 has implications on PCa cell viability and androgen-independence. Past reports of the regulation of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) demonstrated Hh signaling inhibition sensitized CRPC to androgen-targeted therapy. Interestingly, Hh signaling target genes are expressed nearly exclusively by colon fibroblast cells of the colon cancer microenvironment, while cognate ligands were expressed by tumor cells. Reports have indicated that lipids can regulate Hh signaling at multiple levels, and that cholesterol modifications needed to support the interactions of Hh with the cell membrane promote Hh protein stability in the extracellular milieu. However, the involvement of Hh signaling in the interactions between PCa epithelium and stroma in the context of a high-fat diet remains an open question.Stromal\u2013epithelial interactions play a role in cancer progression, differentiation, and therapeutic responsiveness. CAF are activated fibroblasts that have an elevated secretion of chemokines, matrix proteins, and immunomodulatory factors compared to normal fibroblasts. The volume of CAF in PCa validated by the tissue microarray of 847 patients is a suggested prognostic marker for recurrence-free survival. CAF and normal fibroblasts can be functionally differentiated as benign cells that can induce tumorigenesis in non-tumorigenic prostatic epithelia, as previously reported. The interaction of cancer and stromal fibroblast cells contribute to PCa progression at both early and late stages of the disease. We have previously published that stromal epigenetic alterations mediate paracrine oncogenic signaling and epithelial metabolic reprogramming, along with altering sensitivity to androgen-targeted therapy. The implications of lipids in paracrine signaling was demonstrated recently as CAF were found to secrete fatty acids and phospholipids in potentiating colorectal cancer-cell migration. Further, the intake of saturated fatty acids has been associated with PCa progression. As with other cancers, the lineage plasticity of PCa is defined as a morphologic and functional shift from adenocarcinoma to another differentiation state in response to therapy, often having features of a small cell or neuroendocrine phenotype. Here, we examine a mechanism that explains the observed cooperative signaling of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol in promoting PCa lineage plasticity. SOX2 has emerged as an important mediator of PCa lineage plasticity, with this differentiative state being associated with androgen-targeted-therapy resistance. Blocking saturated fatty acid signaling in CAF limited paracrine-mediated PCa progression in combination with enzalutamide, a widely used second-generation androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor (ARSI).2. Materials and Methods2.1. ReagentsEnzalutamide (Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) was given to cells at 5 uM and 5 mg/kg in mice by oral gavage.

After washing with PBS and rinsing with H2O, the cells were covered with a mounting medium containing DAPI (H-1200, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Stained cells were imaged on a Leica confocal microscope at 40X magnification (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).2.5. Flow CytometryA quantity of 2 \u00d7 105 cells were seeded in 6-well format overnight, then treated with 20 \u00b5g/mL of cholesterol for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS, detached using Accutase solution (00455556, Fisher Scientific), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (IC fixation buffer, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) at room temperature for 15 min on ice. Cells were permeabilized on ice with 1X permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibody \u03b1-acetylated \u03b1-tubulin (T7451, Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with 1X PBS before 30 min of incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (A11001, Fisher Scientific) on ice in the dark. Cells were washed twice with PBS, then resuspended in PBS and analyzed using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cells were kept on ice and in the dark until ready for analysis. FACS data were analyzed using FlowJo software v10.9.2.6. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) SequensingA quantity of 1 \u00d7 107 cells were harvested and fixed with 2 mL of 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature with gentle rotation. A total of 2 mL of 250 mM of glycine was then added to terminate the processing. A ChIP experiment for H3K27Ac (ab4729, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and a computational analysis of ChIP-seq data were performed as previously described.2.7.

Twenty-four hours after the addition of the transfection mix, the liposomes were removed and fresh media was added. The human Wnt5a siRNA is a pool of 3 different siRNA duplexes:2.8. Clonogenic AssaysCells were seeded in 12-well plates overnight (22Rv1 700 cells/well, ARCaPM 200 cells/well), then treated with palmitate, cholesterol, or both. Colonies were stained with 5% crystal violet in methanol for 20 min after 14 days. We then used 30% acetic acid in water solubilizing the colonies. The quantification of the colonies was shown by optical density 595 (OD595) measured by spectrophotometer in three independent experiments.2.9. Animal StudiesAll animal procedures were performed according to an approved protocol from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Male NSG mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME, USA), 6\u20138 weeks old, were used for prostatic orthotopic grafting or subcutaneous implantations into the flank, as previously described. For the orthotopic grafting, mice were randomly divided into 3 groups, fed a normal isocaloric rodent diet, a 40% high-fat diet (F10046, Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ, USA), and a 2% high-cholesterol diet (F10036, Bio-Serv), respectively. The formulation of the high-fat and high-cholesterol diet are in Supplementary Table S2. After 4 weeks of each diet, 2.5 \u00d7 105 ARCaPM cells and 7.5 \u00d7 105 CAF were engrafted orthotopically into the anterior lobe of the prostate and harvested after 4 weeks of implantation, as has been described before. For the subcutaneous implantations, all mice were fed with a 40% high-fat diet (F10046, Bio-Serv) for 4 weeks, then 2.5 \u00d7 105 22Rv1 cells and 7.5 \u00d7 105 CAF were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of the mice. After 4 weeks, mice were randomized to either be injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 mg/kg of neutralizing anti-CD36 antibody or corresponding IgG1 control every 3 days for a week. All mice were subsequently treated daily with enzalutamide for 3 days via oral gavage (5 mg/kg). Following these procedures, mice were euthanized and tumors were harvested for analyses.2.10. ImmunohistochemistryAll tissue biopsies were fixed in 4% paraformadehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 \u03bcm sections. The tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated through xylene and a graded alcohol series using a standard protocol. Following antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase activity was then quenched with 3% H2O2. Non-specific epitopes were blocked with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the sections were stained with anti-SOX2 (14962, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) and anti-phosphorylated histone H3 (PH-H3, 06-570, Sigma) antibodies. Sections were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with adequate humidity. Sections were washed with PBS, then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (31460, Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Tissues were visualized by DAB (3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride substrate, 550880, BD Biosciences). TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (S7100, Fisher Scientific). Slides were scanned by Olympus BX51 at 200 x magnification. At least 5 fields per tissue were quantified with Image J.2.11. Statistical AnalysisComparisons between the studied groups were performed by the paired Student\u2019s t-test. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare variable changes according to the levels of two categorical variables. Results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD and considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. All data were calculated from at least 3 separate experiments. Graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).3. Results3.1. Cholesterol and Fatty Acid Signaling in PCa CellsLowering cholesterol has been shown to limit PCa progression by providing a clinical benefit to patients. Hh signaling in particular has been associated with cholesterol in PCa cells. We corroborated past findings of Hh downstream gene expression in PCa cells following 48 h incubation with cholesterol (20 \u00b5g/mL). Cholesterol elevated Gli1 and Gli2 mRNA expression in 22Rv1 PCa cells (p < 0.05; Figure 1a). Cholesterol also increased Gli1 and PTCH1 mRNA expression in ARCaPM PCa cells (p < 0.01; Figure 1a). The Hh signaling pathway depends on the secretion of the Hh ligand, Sonic Hh (SHH), Indian Hh (IHH), and Desert Hh (DHH). We detected these Hh ligands, and found that IHH was elevated in 22Rv1 (p < 0.01); IHH, SHH, and DHH were also elevated in ARCaPM (p < 0.01). Two-way ANOVA analysis of these Hh-related genes in 22Rv1 and ARCaPM treated with cholesterol were significantly increased compared to control cells (p < 10\u22124; Figure 1a). Canonical Hh signaling relies on primary cilia and is associated with \u03b1-tubulin expression. We demonstrated for the first time in immunofluorescence studies that cholesterol-treated cells had greater cell-surface staining for \u03b1-tubulin by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry in 22Rv1 cells (p < 0.001; Figure 1b,c). This was quantified by quantitative PCR, where cholesterol treatment increased \u03b1-tubulin mRNA expression (p < 0.05; Figure 1d). Canonical Hh signaling involving patched expression-promoted Gli signaling was enriched at the cilium (Figure 1e).Following this, we wanted to determine the role saturated fatty acids play on Hh signaling in PCa cells independent of cholesterol signaling. We first evaluated the expression of Hh signaling in 22Rv1 and ARCaPM cells. Both cell lines showed significantly more PTCH2 and DHH in response to palmitate treatment after 48 h and the absence of Gli and PTCH1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (100 \u00b5M\u2013200 \u00b5M, p < 0.001; Figure 2a). The expression of DHH and PTCH2 was not induced by low-dose (50 \u00b5M) palmitate in either 22Rv1 or ARCaPM (p > 0.05; Supplemental Figure S1a,b). To examine specific transcriptomic changes due to cholesterol and free fatty acids, we used histone H3-AcK27 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing. Examining known targets of Hh signaling associated with lineage plasticity, we found enrichment of the SOX2 promoter. Palmitate induced more H3-AcK27 enrichment of SOX2 over either cholesterol or vehicle (Figure 2b). These findings were consistent with the concomitant induction of SOX2 expression by palmitate (100 \u00b5M), but not cholesterol in 22Rv1 (p < 0.001; Figure 2c). The induction of SOX2 by saturated fatty acids seems to involve autocrine Hh signaling.Multiple pieces of evidence support the role of stromal fibroblastic cells in PCa progression and castration resistance. Accordingly, we tested the impact of CAF on SOX2 expression in 22Rv1 cells in response to cholesterol and palmitate. The 100 \u00b5M palmitate concentration previously used seemed to induce CAF cell death; thus, SOX2 expression was tested under 50 \u00b5M palmitate, 20 \u00b5g/mL cholesterol, or a combination in cocultures of 22Rv1 and CAF. SOX2 expression in 22Rv1 under a lower palmitate dose was not observed (Supplemental Figure S1c). However, SOX2 expression in 22Rv1 was over twentyfold higher when cells were cocultured with CAF compared to the epithelia alone, under vehicle treatment (p < 0.01; Figure 2d). A further elevation of SOX2 expression was found with palmitate treatment compared to coculture control (p < 0.05; Figure 2d). Unexpectedly, the combination of palmitate and cholesterol dramatically promoted the 22Rv1 expression of SOX2, which was increased fourfold over cocultured CAF receiving no treatment (p < 0.01; Figure 2d). Conditional media collected from CAF treated with palmitate, in the presence or absence of cholesterol, was added to 22Rv1 cells. SOX2 was not induced in 22Rv1 under these conditions (Supplemental Figure S1d). This suggested that SOX2 expression by cancer epithelia was induced by crosstalk with CAF, rather than secreted factors from these cells. Both fatty acids and cholesterol seem to have independent roles in promoting Hh signaling. The role of Hh signaling in developmental processes suggests its potential efficiency in regulating differentiation through SOX2 regulation.3.2. Combined Treatment of Palmitate and Cholesterol Induce Lineage Plasticity in PCa Cells by Cancer-Stroma InteractionsThere are limited studies about the role palmitate and cholesterol play in stromal fibroblastic cells and how these metabolites affect PCa epithelia. Therefore, cocultures of PCa cells and primary CAF were incubated with palmitate in the presence or absence of cholesterol. The expression of Hh ligands in cocultured CAF and 22Rv1 was independently measured. We found that in CAF, both SHH and DHH were significantly elevated by the palmitate treatment alone, and the palmitate/cholesterol-combination treatment only further increased DHH (p < 0.01; Figure 3a). SHH expression was significantly elevated by the independent cholesterol and palmitate treatments when 22Rv1 and CAF were cocultured (p < 0.05; Figure 3a). SHH was further increased by the palmitate/cholesterol combination treatment (p < 0.001; Figure 3a). However, DHH was not found to be induced under these conditions in 22Rv1. When the two cell types were cocultured, the Hh signaling mediators GLI1 and PTCH2 were significantly increased by palmitate (p < 0.01) and palmitate/cholesterol-combination treatments (p < 0.001) as seen in 22Rv1 cells (Figure 3b). Since downstream SOX2 is reported to play key roles in PCa lineage plasticity, we next tested for the expression of luminal, basal, and neuroendocrine differentiation markers. The palmitate/cholesterol combination greatly elevated the expression of neuroendocrine and basal markers; but reduced the expression of luminal cell markers in 22Rv1 cells cocultured with CAF, an indicator of lineage plasticity (Figure 3c). Two-way ANOVA analysis of neuroendocrine-related genes, basal markers in 22Rv1 treated with palmitate/cholesterol combination, found them to be significantly increased compared to control cells (p < 10\u22124), while luminal markers were significantly increased compared to control (p < 10\u22124). In palmitate-treated cells, neuroendocrine markers were upregulated (p < 0.001) and luminal markers were downregulated (p < 0.01). The changes on the same genes were not evident by cholesterol alone. In testing the potential impact of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol generated by palmitate metabolism, we treated cocultures with palmitate or a palmitate/cholesterol combination, and blocked HMG-CoA reductase with simvastatin. We found that these combinations did not decrease SOX2 expression in 22Rv1 cocultured with CAF (Figure 3d). Simvastatin also failed to reduce PTCH2 and GLI1 under palmitate treatment conditions (Supplemental Figure S1e). Thus, the upregulation of PTCH2 and DHH by palmitate was not cholesterol dependent, suggesting some specificity to Hh signaling by fatty acids. On the other hand, the administration of the Gli inhibitor, GANT61, was able to significantly limit SOX2 induction under either palmitate or palmitate/cholesterol combination treatments (p > 0.01, Figure 3e). The role of CAF in promoting PCa epithelial SOX2 expression in response to free fatty acid was dependent on Hh signaling rather than cholesterol biosynthesis.In order to determine the mechanism of the elevated Hh-mediated SOX2 expression promoted by the CAF, compared to the PCa cells alone, we examined some putative mediators based on past reports suggesting the expression of Wnt ligands by CAF. CAF cocultured with 22Rv1 treated with palmitate or a palmitate/cholesterol combination demonstrated significant Wnt5a expression by the CAF (p < 0.0001; Figure 4a). Similarly, the CAF demonstrated significant Wnt5a upregulation by palmitate alone and the palmitate/cholesterol combination over the untreated control when cocultured with ARCaPM (p < 0.05; Figure 4a). Induction of Wnt2 and Wnt3a was not observed under the same conditions (Supplemental Figure S1f). To directly interrogate the role of Wnt5a, it was knocked down in CAF. Compared to the scrambled siRNA-control-transfected CAF, knocking down Wnt5a eliminated SOX2 induction in 22Rv1, otherwise stimulated by palmitate or the palmitate/cholesterol combination (p < 0.001; Figure 4b). In addition, knocking down Wnt5a expression in CAF significantly limited the 22Rv1 expression of Gli1 and PTCH2 under palmitate and palmitate/cholesterol-combination conditions (Figure 4c). The observed cooperativity of prostatic epithelia and CAF in response to palmitate was lost when Wnt5a signaling was limited.3.3. Free Fatty Acid Signaling Mediates PCa Androgen Targeted Therapy SensitivityIn light of previous studies examining the role of cholesterol and fatty acids on PCa tumor growth, we tested the role of high-fat versus high-cholesterol isocaloric diets in prostatic orthotopic mouse models engrafted with ARCaPM and CAF cells. The mouse weight did not differ among the control, high-fat, and high-cholesterol conditions (n = 3, Supplemental Figure S2a). There was no statistical difference in tumor weight among the groups, although the tumor weight was somewhat greater in the mice given a high cholesterol diet, compared to the control or high-fat diet (Figure 5a). These findings were corroborated using colony-forming assays of both 22Rv1 and ARCaPM cells grown with palmitate, cholesterol, or a combination thereof. Cholesterol promoted greater colony formation compared to the control in both cell types (p < 0.0001; Supplemental Figure S2b,c). Strikingly, the RNA expression of SOX2 was about twentyfold greater in the tumors of the high-fat-diet-fed mice compared to cholesterol or control (p < 0.0001; Figure 5a). Further induction of the lineage plasticity markers of neuroendocrine and basal differentiation was greatest under high-fat diet condition (p < 10\u22124, p < 0.01, respectively), while luminal markers were significantly decreased (p < 10\u22124, Figure 5b). SOX2 histochemical staining was much greater in tumor tissues from mice on the high-fat diet than those on the control isocaloric diet (Figure 5c). While changes in mouse diet did not appreciably effect tumor growth, the high-fat diet potentiated SOX2 expression and the downstream lineage plasticity of the tumors.We next used anti-CD36 neutralizing antibody to inhibit fatty acid signaling under palmitate treatment. Mice were treated with anti-CD36 antibody for one week, since neutralizing antibodies generally take one week to achieve a dose that reaches biologic efficacy. It is reported that maximal apoptosis following castration in mice occurred on day four. Thus, we treated mice with anti-CD36 for one week to limit free fatty acid signaling, then administered enzalutamide for three days and harvested the next day. We found that anti-CD36 antibody treatment limited the expression of Wnt5a by CAF and SOX2 expression by PCa epithelia (p < 0.001; Figure 6a). In addition, a cell-counting study revealed that inhibiting CD36 alone had little effect on cell proliferation, while the combination of anti-CD36 and enzalutamide resulted in fewer PCa cells compared to enzalutamide alone (p < 0.05; Figure 6b). We tested the role of anti-CD36 in mice subcutaneously implanted with 22Rv1 and CAF under high-fat diet conditions. A mouse study was designed based on the findings of the coculture experiments where all mice were given a high-fat diet and xenografted with 22Rv1 and CAF cells. When the tumors reached approximately 1 cm3, the mice were randomized to receive anti-CD36 neutralizing antibody or IgG followed by enzalutamide (Figure 6c). Consistent with the coculture studies, SOX2 expression was inhibited. We also found phosphorylated-histone H3 was inhibited, while TUNEL staining was elevated by anti-CD36 antibody in the context of enzalutamide, compared to the IgG control.4. DiscussionWe identified the role of saturated fatty acids in PCa-cell lineage plasticity reprogramming via paracrine interactions with CAF. Initially, our data confirmed that exogenously added cholesterol could activate canonical Hh signaling associated with the cilium (Figure 1). Interestingly, we found the ARCaPM cells to be more sensitive to palmitate compared to the 22Rv1 cell line. We initiated this study with 22Rv1 and ARCaPM, because these two cell lines maintain some level of sensitivity to androgen-targeted therapy and can be demonstrated to be more resistant or sensitive to androgen-targeted therapy. Palmitate induced a Gli-independent Hh signaling pathway (Figure 2). This finding represented an observed effect of non-canonical signaling in PCa cells. When PCa cells were cocultured with CAF, we found Hh signaling was induced more by palmitate, in the presence or absence of cholesterol, compared to the cholesterol-treated group (Figure 3). Palmitate-induced Hh signaling was found to promote SOX2 in PCa epithelia in the context of CAF as a master regulator of lineage plasticity. SOX2 is also known to promote cell transition from AR-dependent luminal epithelial cells to AR-independent basal-like cells. Previous reports have demonstrated that reduced expression of the luminal phenotype correlates with poor survival prognosis in PCa patients.Our findings support these studies, as the enhanced SOX2 expression seen during palmitate and cholesterol treatments also contributed to increased basal and neuroendocrine gene expression. Palmitate, alone or in combination with cholesterol, elevated the expression of basal and neuroendocrine markers, while downregulating the expression of luminal cell markers. The translational implications of PCa lineage plasticity are well described as a means of therapy-resistance development. However, the upstream mediators for this differentiative state are less understood. Although Hh signaling is a viable upstream mediator of SOX2 expression, the observation that CAF can further promote SOX2 expression and lineage plasticity was an important finding in revealing a new interventional target mitigating the response to a high-fat diet.The combination of palmitate and cholesterol induced the highest levels of SOX2 in the context of CAF. This indicated that CAF plays an important role in the expression of SOX2 in epithelia cancer cells. Our previous research found that prostate stroma could induce PCa-cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by CAF-derived Wnt ligands. Many studies have demonstrated that the non-canonical Wnt pathway plays an important role in PCa metastasis. Androgen-signaling inhibition elevated Wnt2, Wnt3a, and Wnt5a expression in CAF, and enhanced tumor epithelial cell survival. Other studies indicated that Wnt5a expression in the circulating tumor cells of patients with metastatic castration-resistant PCa was a negative indicator of overall survival. In addition, Wnt5a expression by bone-marrow fibroblasts is found to promote PCa bone metastasis. Antagonizing Wnt5a in CAF can inhibit gastric-cancer-cell growth and migration. Our studies here support Wnt5a as a potential paracrine driver of tumor progression in response to a high-fat diet (Figure 4). We found that Wnt5a from CAF can drive Hh-mediated SOX2 expression in PCa cells to promote lineage plasticity. Knowing the prevalence of PCa and the consumption of high-fat diets in the western world, our present findings warrant further clinical validation.A commercially available Gli inhibitor, GANT61, was able to inhibit SOX2 induction in PCa epithelia when cocultured with CAF treated with palmitate. However, in the same context, there was no difference in the expression of SOX2 when simvastatin was given instead. This indicates that the role of CAF in promoting PCa epithelial SOX2 expression in response to free fatty acid is associated with Hedgehog signaling rather than cholesterol biosynthesis. A recent study showed that SOX2 expression correlated with a shorter time to metastasis and decreased survival after biochemical recurrence in a case-control cohort study of 1028 annotated tumor specimens. They also demonstrated that SOX2 mediates metabolic reprogramming of prostate cancer cells by inducing increased glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, as well as increased numbers of mitochondria.CD36 plays an important role in the process of metastasis and correlates with poor prognosis in oral cancer, lung squamous cancer, bladder cancer, and breast cancer. Inhibiting CD36 in PCa could reduce the uptake of fatty acids, cell proliferation, and cancer aggressiveness. Our data suggest that CD36 inhibition could further reduce Wnt5a expression by CAF, inhibit SOX2 expression in PCa, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in mice receiving a high-fat diet and treated with enzalutamide (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Thus, targeting CD36 might be an effective strategy for treating PCa patients.Obesity in PCa patients, associated with excessive white adipose tissue, contributes to the population of CAF and promotes cancer progression. Interestingly, our studies involving NSG (NOD SCID gamma) mouse xenograft models have a limited capacity to become obese. We are aware that the results of a high-fat diet on the mouse models may need to be further studied in immunocompetent models. Insulin insensitivity associated with obesity downstream of PI3K-mTOR signaling promotes lipogenesis. It may play a role in remodeling the tumor microenvironment as well as support anti-apoptotic signals in the cancer cells. NSG mice are known to exhibit insulin-dependent diabetes and the high-fat diet prevents the mice from developing autoimmune diabetes. As such, the standard elevation of insulin associated with a high-fat diet is not observed in NSG mice. Thus, the observations in our work are likely due to a more direct result of circulating fat (and cholesterol), akin to that observed in cell culture. Under the high-fat diet, the elevated circulating fatty acids likely supported CD36 signaling of paracrine initiators such as Wnt5a by stromal fibroblasts. While further exploration will be necessary, our data indicate that palmitate promotes paracrine Wnt5a secretion from CAF to induce PCa lineage plasticity and therapy resistance.5. ConclusionsThe present study indicates that palmitate and cholesterol induce lineage plasticity in prostate cancer by cancer\u2013stroma interactions through Hedgehog and non-canonical Wnt signaling. We found that a high-fat diet induces lineage plasticity in prostate cancer epithelial cells by increasing SOX2 expression in both coculture and xenograft models. The resulting palmitate signaling promotes lineage plasticity culminating in resistance to androgen-targeted therapy. Understanding paracrine and autocrine interactions of Hedgehog and androgen signaling will enable the restoration of treatment responsiveness.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at: , Figure S1.

        "content": "The tumor microenvironment plays pivotal roles in promotion of many malignancies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been well-known to promote proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis but mechanistic understanding of tumor-stroma interactions is not yet complete. Recently, estrogen synthetic enzymes were reported to be upregulated by co-culture with stromal cells in ER positive breast carcinoma (BC) but effects of co-culture on androgen metabolism have not been extensively examined. Therefore, we evaluated roles of CAFs on androgen metabolism in ER-negative AR-positive BC through co-culture with CAFs. Concentrations of steroid hormone in supernatant of co-culture of MDA-MB-453 and primary CAFs were measured using GC-MS. Cytokines derived from CAFs were determined using Cytokine Array. Expressions of androgen synthetic enzymes were confirmed using RT-PCR and Western blotting. Correlations between CAFs and androgen synthetic enzymes were analyzed using triple-negative BC (TNBC) patient tissues by immunohistochemistry. CAFs were demonstrated to increase expressions and activities of 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1. IL-6 and HGF that were selected as potential paracrine mediators using cytokine array induced 17\u03b2HSD2, 17\u03b2HSD5, and 5\u03b1-Reductase1 expression. Underlying mechanisms of IL-6 paracrine regulation of 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 could be partially dependent on phosphorylated STAT3, while phosphorylated ERK could be involved in HGF-mediated 5\u03b1-Reductase1 induction. \u03b1-SMA status was also demonstrated to be significantly correlated with 17\u03b2HSD2 and 17\u03b2HSD5 status in TNBC tissues, especially AR-positive cases. Results of our present study suggest that both IL-6 and HGF derived from CAFs could contribute to the intratumoral androgen metabolism in ER-negative BC patients.",

Tumors of the triple-negative subtype of breast cancer (TNBC; generally corresponding to the \u201cBasal/Basal-like\u201d subtype of patient datasets, determined by PAM50 gene signatures) lack the expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, progesterone receptor and HER2, are highly aggressive and are most likely to recur. Unlike the luminal-A tumors that are characterized by better survival, or the HER2+ tumors, TNBC/basal tumors cannot be treated by receptor-targeted therapies and demonstrate high relapse rates following chemotherapy.As with other malignancies, breast tumors develop and progress within an intimate tumor microenvironment (TME). Recent studies indicate that stromal cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key regulators of tumor progression in cancer. In general, MSCs enrich the TME with tumor-promoting factors, and endow the tumor cells with improved abilities to invade and generate metastases; MSCs also undergo transition to CAFs that promote breast cancer/TNBC progression. Particularly in TNBC, MSCs contribute to higher aggressiveness by promoting the expression of angiogenic factors and pro-metastatic chemokines such as the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts). The axes established by these chemokines and their receptors are well-known for their pro-tumorigenic roles, including in TNBC [e.g., ].Tumor-educated MSCs evolve within a TME enriched with inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which generally promote breast cancer progression. Two such pro-inflammatory cytokines are tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). It was demonstrated that despite its potential anti-tumor cytotoxic activities, chronic presence of TNF\u03b1 in tumors has led to tumor progression. Joined with the pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory activities of IL-1\u03b2, the two cytokines were identified as pro-metastatic factors in many tumor types. In TNBC, sequencing, serum-profiling and immunohistochemistry studies of small patient cohorts provided initial evidence to relevance of high expression of the two cytokines or of their signaling components to metastasis in TNBC patients; in parallel, studies in animal models have demonstrated causative tumor-promoting roles for TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC. TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were also connected with pro-malignancy activities of MSCs and CAFs in TNBC. Specifically with regards to chemokines, we and others have shown that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 elevated the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 (or their murine counterparts) by MSCs [; the degree of increase depended on assay conditions], thus promoting the pro-inflammatory and pro-malignancy phenotype of these stromal cells.However, to date, we still lack understanding of the interactions that are established between TNBC cells, stromal cells and their intimate pro-inflammatory TME, and we do not have enough information on the way such interactions affect disease course. Specifically, it is not known whether the pro-metastatic characteristics of the TME and of the tumor cells are increased when TNBC cells interact with MSCs/CAFs in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Thus, the aim of our present study was to identify the influence of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage on the content of pro-metastatic chemokines as proxies for potential pro-malignancy activities that enrich the TME of TNBC tumors, as well as on angiogenesis and on the migratory, invasive and metastatic properties of TNBC cells.In view of their high relevance to tumor progression in TNBC, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were selected as representatives of the pro-inflammatory TME in our study. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of TNBC:stroma co-cultures by these two cytokines has led to increased pro-metastatic activities at multiple levels, including: expression levels of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, cancer cell morphology, tumor cell migration and tumor cell invasion. Importantly, we found that CXCL8 was a key regulator of the pro-metastatic activities that came into play in the TNBC-stroma-inflammation networks, including angiogenesis, metastasis-related morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion of TNBC cells. Moreover, the tumor-stroma-inflammation network has promoted the metastatic potential of TNBC cells and has led to elevated metastasis in vivo. Parallel in-culture studies that were performed with tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with luminal-A cells demonstrated that in general they were less potent or differently active than those established with TNBC cells.Thus, our findings set the pro-inflammatory inputs acting at the tumor:stroma interface, and their pro-metastatic outputs, as targets for improved therapy in TNBC. Since inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are used vastly in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, our findings suggest that these two cytokines may be considered as novel therapeutic modalities in TNBC. Such an approach, combined with the use of chemokine receptor inhibitors [e.g., of the CXCL8 receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2; ], may prevent tumor-stroma interactions that increase metastasis in TNBC.Materials and MethodsAnalyses of Patient DatasetsRNAseq-based gene expression analyses of breast cancer patient data were performed with the TCGA dataset. Subtypes were defined based on the PAM50 annotation file provided within the dataset: Basal (often overlapping the term TNBC): 141 patients; Luminal-A: 421 patients. Gene expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 were determined. In all analyses, log2-transformed expression values of the genes were presented. Statistical analyses were performed following Shapiro-Wilk test, determining the normality of distribution for each gene by individual subtype. Comparisons of gene expression levels between the two clinical subtypes were presented in boxplots. p-values were determined by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The distribution of gene expression levels in basal and luminal-A patients was presented in histograms, where statistical analyses were performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. In studies correlating the expression levels of the different genes, correlation coefficients and p-values were analyzed using Spearman correlation. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Breast Tumor Cell Lines and Stromal CellsThe human TNBC cell lines (all from ATCC) included: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells that were grown in DMEM (Gibco, Life technologies, Grand island, NY); BT-549 cells that were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit Ha'emek, Israel). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Biological Industries); for BT-549 cells, recombinant human (rh) insulin (10 mg/ml; #I9278; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to the medium. The human luminal-A cell lines MCF-7 (from ATCC) and T47D [provided by Dr. Keydar who generated the cell line ] were grown in culture in the same medium as MDA-MB-231 cells. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial ST1.6R cells (HPMEC) were kindly provided by Dr. Unger and Dr. Kirkpatrick, Institute of Pathology, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. These cells were grown as described in Krump-Konvalinkova et al., with minor modifications.Human bone marrow-derived MSCs were purchased from Lonza (#PT-2501; Walkersville, MD), which validated them as MSCs based on cell markers and differentiation potential. Routine growth of MSCs took place in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium (#PT-3001; Lonza) or in MesenCult (#05411; Stemcell Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) and they were used for up to 10 passages. In this study, MSCs of four different healthy donors were used. Patient-derived CAFs from a primary breast tumor (used in ELISA and their accompanying signaling experiments) and from a lung metastasis (used in tumor cell invasion assays) were kindly provided by Dr. Bar, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel). The cells were grown, identified and immortalized as described in Katanov et al..TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Concentrations Used in Different AnalysesTitration studies were initiated by determining the ability of rhTNF\u03b1 (#300-01A, PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), and rhIL-1\u03b2 (#200-01B, PeproTech) to elevate in MDA-MB-231 cells and/or MSCs/CAFs the expression of CXCL8, CCL2 and/or CCL5 to levels that enabled us to perform the required comparisons between different cell combinations in ELISA studies (concentrations studied - TNF\u03b1: 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml; IL-1\u03b2: 20, 100, 250, 350, 500, 750 pg/ml). The selected concentrations of 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2 were appropriate also for MSC and CAF experiments. Therefore, in all MDA-MB-231 studies, alone or with MSC/CAF, these selected concentrations were used in in vitro and in vivo experiments.In parallel, titration studies indicated that the above selected concentrations were not optimal for ELISA responses of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cells; thus, based on additional analyses, the concentrations of cytokines were raised in these two cell types: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. These selected cytokine concentrations were used in all studies of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells, alone or with MSCs.The effects of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 on morphological changes, angiogenesis, migration and invasion with MCF-7 cells were determined in the same concentrations as used for MDA-MB-231 cells (10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2). In ELISA studies (and their accompanying signaling experiments) in MCF-7 and T47D cells cytokine concentrations were raised to 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. Although published data [e.g., ] and our past studies indicated that lower TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 concentrations (as in MDA-MB-231 cells) induce signaling and up-regulate the levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 in MCF-7 and T47D cells, we expected that these cytokine concentrations will not enable us to clearly distinguish \u201cintermediate\u201d levels of chemokine induction in ELISA assays. Thus, cytokine concentrations were increased, as described above.Western Blot StudiesBased on kinetics analyses (Data not shown), cells were stimulated for 15 min by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle (similar for both cytokines), in medium containing 0.5% FBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, followed by conventional Western blot (WB) procedures. The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Phosphorylated (P)-p65 [#3033; Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA]; Total (T)-p65 (#8242; CST); P-JNK (#4668; CST); T-JNK (#9258; CST). Abs directed against GAPDH (#ab9485; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) served for loading controls. The membranes were reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (#111-035-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), and were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (#20-500, Biological Industries).Cell Stimulation in Co-culture ExperimentsTNBC or luminal-A cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs/CAFs (10:1 ratio) in 6-well plates (#3516, Corning, Kennebunk, ME). When relevant, \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures were grown in similar plates, in which the two cell types were separated by an insert of 0.4 \u03bcm permeable polycarbonate membrane (#3412, Corning). In parallel, each cell type was grown individually in the same cell numbers as in co-cultures, in similar plates. The cells were grown in medium containing 10% FBS for 12 h, and were then treated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (concentrations as described above) or their vehicle for 7 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Then, media were replaced by cytokine-free media (with 0.5% FBS) for additional 60 h. Cell conditioned media (CM) were removed and taken for ELISA assays. When indicated, CM and cell lysates were produced from cells that were subjected to gene down-regulation by siRNA, as detailed below. Cell lysates were produced from cells grown in larger vessels 7 h or 15 min after the beginning of cytokine stimulation and were used in quantitative real-time PCR analyses (qRT-PCR) or in WB studies.ELISA AssaysCM obtained from different stimulatory conditions were cleared by centrifugation, followed by determining the expression levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 by ELISA. Standard curves at the linear range of absorbance were produced with rhCXCL8, rhCCL2 and rhCCL5 (#200-8M, #300-04 and #300-06, respectively; PeproTech). The following Abs were used (all from PeproTech, unless otherwise indicated): For CXCL8 - Coating Abs: #500-P28; Detecting Abs: #500-P28Bt. For CCL2 - Coating Abs: #500-M71; Detecting Abs: #500-P34Bt. For CCL5 - Coating Abs: #500-M75; Detecting Abs: #BAF278 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). HRP-conjugated Streptavidin (#016-030-084; Jackson Immunoresearch laboratories) was added, followed by the substrate TMB/E solution (#ES001; Millipore, Temecula, CA); then, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.18 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. To provide data on the contents of chemokines generated in each of the treatments and to clearly denote the differences in chemokine production between the different conditions, the findings are presented in ng/ml.In reversibility experiments, MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 for 67 h or exposed to vehicle control. Media were replaced and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in TNF\u03b1-free media. CM that were collected following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal, were subjected to ELISA analysis of CXCL8 expression as described above.qRT-PCR AnalysesTotal RNA was extracted using the EZ-RNA kit (#20-400; Biological Industries). Using the M-MLV reverse transcriptase (#AM2044; Ambion, Austin, TX), first-strand cDNA was generated from RNA samples. cDNA targets were quantified by qRT-PCR on Rotor Gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science, Concorde, NSW, Australia). Absolute Blue qPCR SYBR Green ROX mix (#AB-4163/A; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to detect transcripts, according to manufacturer's instructions. Two pairs of specific primers were used (Supplementary Table 1), designed to span different exons. Data were normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Dissociation curves for each primer set indicated a single product, and \u201cno-template\u201d controls were negative after the 40 cycles used for analysis. Quantification was performed by standard curves, within the linear range of quantification.Endothelial Cell Migration and SproutingTo generate CM for functional in vitro angiogenesis assays, MDA-MB-231:MSC and MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10:1 cell ratio in each) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 7 h; in parallel, CM were produced from tumor cells that were treated by vehicle, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1, or from tumor cells grown with MSCs only. Media were removed and the cells were cultured for additional 60 h in TNF\u03b1-free medium (with 0.5% FBS). CM were collected, cleared by filtration through a 0.45 \u03bcm membrane, and loaded in the lower part of migration transwells (#3422, Corning) with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes. The migration of HPMEC cells in direction of the different CM was determined after up to 90 min. At the end of the experiments, cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes, the membranes were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained by Hemacolor (#1.11661; Merck). Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple bright fields were counted.In parallel, CM were also used in sprouting assays of mCherry-expressing HPMECs out of 3D multicellular spheroids (all generated by the same cell number) that were formed in hanging drops for 24 h and embedded into collagen type I (1.3 mg/ml; #354236; Corning). Sprouting of endothelial cells in response to CM was visualized by fluorescent microscopy after 10 days, and was determined quantitatively in multiple spheroids by mCherry signals of cells that sprouted out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ.Tumor Cell Morphology, Migration and InvasionIn morphology assays, \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-expressing tumor cells - MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 - and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 for 67 h; in parallel, mCherry-tumor cells were grown with vehicle, with TNF\u03b1 only or with MSCs only. Then, tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy at x100 magnification, in multiple fields. In reversibility experiments of MDA-MB-231 cells, media were replaced in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures after 67 h, and cell growth was continued for 10\u201314 days in cytokine-free medium. Morphology was determined following 67 h of stimulation, and 10\u201314 days after cytokine removal.Migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in transwells with 8-\u03bcm pore membranes (#3422, Corning). In these assays, mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs (ratio 10:1) were added to the upper part of the chambers, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) in serum-free medium. The same number of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in parallel transwells, in the presence of vehicle control or of TNF\u03b1 alone. Migration was performed for 12 h toward medium containing 10% FBS [containing TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, as appropriate]. The numbers of migrating tumor cells were determined by staining with rabbit Abs to RPF (recognizing mCherry; #PM005; MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by DyLight 550-conjugated Donkey Abs recognizing rabbit IgG (#ab96920, Abcam). Cells were removed from the upper side of the membranes and fixed in ice-cold methanol. Based on DyLight 550 signals and Hemacolor staining used in preliminary analyses (Data not shown), we validated that close to 100% of migrating cells were the tumor cells. Photos of multiple high power fluorescent fields were taken at \u00d7 100 magnification. Cells that transmigrated to the lower side of the membranes in multiple fluorescence fields were counted.Migration of Hoechst-labeled MCF-7 cells was determined by using the same experimental groups as in TNBC studies. MCF-7 cells are known as having a relatively low basal migratory potential, thus appropriate conditions were set, based on published studies and preliminary analyses in our lab. Thus, the membranes were coated with fibronectin for 1 h (20 \u03bcg/ml; #03-090-1, Biological Industries), cells were loaded to the upper part and after 21 h photos were taken. Hoechst-expressing tumor cells that migrated to the lower side of the membranes were counted in multiple fields.Tumor cell invasion assays were performed using 3D multicellular spheroids that were generated for 72 h in hanging-drops [, with minor modifications]. Spheroids of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, consisting of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs/CAFs (ratio 10:1) were embedded into matrigel (9\u201310.5 mg/ml; #356234, Corning) and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle. Spheroids were also formed with mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells alone, and treated by TNF\u03b1 or by vehicle (same number of cells as in co-cultures). Invasion of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells was determined 48 h after the addition of cytokine stimulation (or vehicle). Multiple spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields at x40 magnification. The invaded area was determined by the mCherry signals of cells that invaded out of spheroid core, quantified by ImageJ. Invasion of MCF-7 cells was determined in a similar manner after 96 h, using mCherry-MCF-7 cells and patient-derived CAFs, in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or its vehicle control. Spheroids were photographed in fluorescent fields 96 h after the addition of stimulation, at \u00d7 40 magnification.CXCL8 Down-Regulation by siRNAKnock-down of CXCL8 expression by transient siRNA transfections was performed in both MDA-MB-231 cells and MSCs, using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection reagent (#56531; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to manufacturer's instructions. ON-TARGET plus siRNA CXCL8 SMART pool and non-targeting control siRNA pool (siCTRL) were used (#L-004756-00 and #D-001810-10, respectively; Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The efficacy of CXCL8 down-regulation was validated by qRT-PCR or ELISA [Data not shown; 80\u201390% as in ] and the cells were used in assays, as necessary.Tumor Growth and Metastasis\u201cContact\u201d co-cultures of mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs (10:1 ratio) were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or vehicle control, in 0.5% FBS-containing medium for 67 h. In each group (Group 1: Co-culture with TNF\u03b1; Group 2: Co-culture with vehicle), the same amount of live co-cultured cells was mixed 1:1 with matrigel (final concentration 4.5 mg/ml; #356234; Corning). The cells were administered orthotopically to the mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (#NUDE242; Envigo RMS, Jerusalem, Israel). During the experiment, tumors of Group 1 were supplemented every 3 days by CM taken from MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures; these CM were generated as follows: The co-cultures were stimulated for 7 h with TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), after which the cytokine was removed, and CM were collected after additional 60 h of growth in cytokine-free and serum-free medium. These CM were filtered, concentrated \u00d7 10, and administered in proximity to tumors. Cytokine- and serum-free media that were put in parallel flasks have undergone similar procedures, and were administered to tumors of Group 2. At the endpoint of experiments (when tumors reached detectable sizes and had to be removed prior to necrosis), approximately 30 days after tumor cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and primary tumors and lungs were excised. Tumor weights were determined, and tumor volumes were calculated based on caliper measurements. Lung metastases were determined ex vivo by the CRi Maestro non-invasive intravital imaging system. The total number of mice that were included in two biological repeats were 12 in Group 1, and 11 in Group 2. Statistical analyses of primary tumor weight and volume were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. The proportions of mice bearing lung metastases were compared by Fisher's exact test. Procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines and policies.Data Presentation and Statistical AnalysesThe statistical analyses of TCGA analyses and in vivo experiments were described in their respective sections. In vitro experiments were performed in n \u2265 3 independent experimental repeats, with MSCs from \u22652 different donors, as indicated in respective figure legends. The results of ELISA, qRT-PCR, WB, HPMEC sprouting and tumor cell migration and invasion assays were compared by two-tailed unpaired Student's t-tests. Values of p \u2264 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Adjustment for multiplicity of comparisons was done using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure controlling the FDR at 0.05. All the significant results remained statistically significant after correcting for their multiplicity, except for some of the WB results. It these latter cases lack of significance was due to high variance between the intensities of effects of the experimental repeats of the test, despite the fact that they all demonstrated the same trend. Thus, in presentation of WB analyses we demonstrate not only the average and standard deviations (SD) of the experimental repeats but also the level of effect in each experiment.ResultsHigh Expression Levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 Are Noted in Tumors of Basal Patients and Are Significantly Coordinated With High Expression Levels of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5To identify the roles of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating tumor-stroma interactions in TNBC, we have extended currently-available studies on TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in TNBC patients and compared the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in two subtypes of breast tumors: (1) Basal tumors, corresponding to the TNBC subtype, which has a most aggressive phenotype; (2) Luminal-A tumors having the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes.Here, by using the TCGA breast cancer dataset we found that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were expressed in significantly higher levels in basal tumors than in luminal-A tumors (Figures 1A1,B1). Distribution analyses (Figures 1A2,B2) demonstrated a larger proportion of basal patients with high TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 expression levels, than luminal-A patients. In parallel, we analyzed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, chosen as proxies for pro-tumorigenic factors that may be enriched in basal patients due to pro-inflammatory signals. These studies demonstrated significantly higher levels of the three chemokines in basal patients than in luminal-A patients (Figures 1C\u2013E).The expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their chemokine targets are significantly higher in basal patients than in luminal-A patients. The Figure demonstrates gene expression analyses, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) TNF\u03b1, (B) IL-1\u03b2, (C) CXCL8, (D) CCL2, (E) CCL5.

(A2\u2013E2) Histograms demonstrating the distribution of expression levels of each of the factors in basal and luminal-A patient tumors. RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Moreover, as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are key inducers of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 expression [e.g., ] we also determined the correlation between the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and each of the three chemokines in basal patients. The findings of Figure 2 indicate that the expression levels of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly correlated and coordinated with the presence of CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 in basal tumors.In basal patients, the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are significantly coordinated with the expression levels of their chemokine targets. The Figure demonstrates correlation analyses of gene expression in basal patients, performed with the TCGA breast cancer dataset. (A) CXCL8 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (A1) and IL-1\u03b2 (A2). (B) CCL2 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (B1) and IL-1\u03b2 (B2). (C) CCL5 correlations with TNF\u03b1 (C1) and IL-1\u03b2 (C2). RSEM, RNAseq by expectation-maximization.Pro-metastatic Chemokines Reach Their Highest Expression Levels When TNBC:Stroma \u201cContact\u201d Co-cultures Are Stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2To follow up on the above findings, we asked how the cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 regulate TNBC:MSC interactions that may lead to elevated release of the chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. First, we validated that the two cytokines could activate transcription pathways that typically induce the expression of these chemokines, namely NF-\u03baB/p65 and JNK/AP-1. Indeed, these pathways were rapidly activated by a brief TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of 15 min (time point and cytokine concentrations were determined by preliminary analyses) in the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells and in MSCs (Figure 3A).CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK, determined by WB in MSCs and in human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells upon 15 min stimulation by TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 or vehicle control (based on kinetics and titration studies. Information on cytokine concentrations is given in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (A1) A representative experiment and (A2) averages \u00b1 SD of p65 and JNK activation (fold induction) in n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. ***p < 0.001, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between the values obtained for cytokine-stimulated cells and control non-stimulated cells. Dashed line stands for the value of 1 given to control cells. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels were determined in TNBC:MSC co-cultures or each of the cell types grown alone, with or without TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation. Co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs were generated in \u201cTranswell\u201d and \u201cContact\u201d conditions and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml), IL-1\u03b2 (350 pg/ml) or vehicle control (similar for both cytokines) for 7 h. After change of media and growth for additional 60 h, the extracellular expression of CXCL8 in TNF\u03b1/IL-1\u03b2-free CM was determined by ELISA. ***p \u2264 0.001, **p \u2264 0.01, *p \u2264 0.05 for differences between TNF\u03b1- or IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells and vehicle-treated cells, within each group. #p-values were <0.01 or <0.001 (in most cases) in comparisons of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments, as well as in comparisons of \u201cTranswell\u201d co-cultures with all other treatments. The results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.Then, to determine if CXCL8 is regulated by tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures were plated in \u201cContact\u201d conditions that enabled direct physical contacts between the two cell types or in \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions that allowed only for the exchange of soluble factors between tumor cells and stromal cells. These co-cultures and each cell type alone were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (or their vehicle) for 7 h (Cytokine concentrations were selected based on titration assays, as described in \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d); the cytokines were removed and cytokine-free CM were collected 60 h later. These experiments revealed that the highest levels of CXCL8 were produced when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B1), and that they were higher than in all other conditions including non-stimulated co-cultures and individual cell types treated with either cytokine. CXCL8 protein levels were elevated also in cytokine-stimulated \u201cTranswell\u201d conditions; however, their total levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower than in cytokine-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 3B1). Accompanying qRT-PCR analyses indicated that CXCL8 induction was regulated at the transcription level (Supplementary Figure 1A), and that increased CXCL8 levels in cytokine-stimulated co-cultures did not result of elevated proliferation of the cells under these conditions (Supplementary Figure 2). Accordingly, we did not detect any substantial cell death or proliferation of any of the cell types due to cellular interactions or cytokine stimulation (Data not shown).Additional experiments revealed similar regulatory modes for CCL2, demonstrating its highest expression levels in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures, obtained partly in a contact-dependent process (Figure 3B2). With CCL5, absolute dependence on TNBC:MSC contacts was revealed, and its expression was further elevated when \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 3B3). As with CXCL8, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 by elevating their mRNA levels (Supplementary Figures 1B,C).Additional analyses performed with TNBC cells that interacted with breast cancer patient-derived CAFs revealed similar regulatory patterns to those described above with MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures: TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation in CAFs (Figure 4A) and elevated all three pro-metastatic chemokines to their highest levels of expression when tumor-stroma-inflammation interactions took place (Figure 4B); moreover, CXCL8 and CCL2 up-regulation depended partly on cell-to-cell contacts whereas induction of CCL5 was fully dependent on direct physical contacts between the tumor cells and the CAFs, and was further induced by stimulation with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2.CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 reach their highest expression levels when TNBC:CAF \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with MDA-MB-231 cells and CAFs, using similar cytokine concentrations. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 (B1), CCL2 (B2) and CCL5 (B3) expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.In view of the high heterogeneity of TNBC tumors, we asked if similar regulatory patterns exist in co-cultures of other human TNBC cells - MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 - with MSCs. The findings of Figure 5A indicate that in both cell lines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced p65 and JNK activation and that the highest CXCL8 expression levels were produced when these TNBC cells physically interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figure 5B). Of interest, the elevation in CXCL8 levels following cytokine stimulation of MDA-MB-468:MSC co-cultures partly depended on physical contacts between the two cell types (Figure 5B1), as was seen in MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures (Figure 3B1). In parallel, in BT-549:MSC co-cultures, CXCL8 elevation in IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells depended on cell-to-cell contacts, while TNF\u03b1 did not have much of an impact under \u201cContact\u201d conditions (Figure 5B2).Increased production of CXCL8 is a general characteristic of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established with TNBC cells. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with human TNBC MDA-MB-468, BT-549 cells and MSCs. Cytokine concentrations: MDA-MB-468 cells - 50 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 500 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2; BT-549 cells - 25 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 and 350 pg/ml IL-1\u03b2. (A) Activation of p65 and JNK. (B) CXCL8 expression levels. In all parts of the Figure, the results are of a representative experiment of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. \u2227In panel 5B1, this value was significant in 2 out of 3 experiments. *, **, ***, # - As described in Figure 3. ns=non-significant.To follow up on the data of Figure 1, indicating that the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 and of their targets - CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 - were significantly lower in luminal-A patients than in basal patients, we determined how these three chemokines are affected by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation of luminal-A:MSC co-cultures. Despite the fact that TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induced potent p65 and JNK activation in T47D and MCF-7 luminal-A cells (Figures 6A, 7A), CXCL8 levels were not increased but rather were decreased when the tumor cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Figures 6B1, 7B). In parallel, CCL2 and CCL5 levels were increased by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated T47D:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (Figures 6B2,B3), but their expression levels were, in general, much lower than those obtained by TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated TNBC:MSC co-cultures (Figures 3B2,B3). Further studies with MCF-7 luminal-A cells demonstrated elevations in the expression of CCL2 and CCL5 in some of the assays under \u201cContact\u201d co-culture conditions following TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulation; however, the expression levels of these chemokines were often too low to provide clear-cut results (Data not shown).CXCL8 expression is down-regulated in TNF\u03b1- and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated luminal-A (T47D): MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures. The Figure demonstrates similar experiments and statistical analyses as those of Figure 3, performed herein with T47D cells and MSCs.

To this end, in the TNBC part we focused on the MDA-MB-231 cells because of their high metastatic potential. In luminal-A studies we chose to investigate MCF-7 cells because of our previous research indicating that they expressed more robust metastasis-related properties than T47D cells when stimulated by pro-inflammatory signals; additional investigations by our group also indicated that MCF-7 cells responded vigorously to TNF\u03b1-containing TME signals in in vivo metastasis studies.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Established With TNBC Cells Lead to Elevated AngiogenesisTo determine the functional consequences of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks, we first determined the ability of factors released by TNBC:MSC co-cultures stimulated by TNF\u03b1 to promote processes involved in angiogenesis. Here, endothelial cells (HPMEC) sprouting assays demonstrated conclusive evidence to higher angiogenesis-supporting potential of TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC (Supplementary Figure 3) compared to CM obtained from control MDA-MB-231 cells. However, these studies did not reveal concrete information on the angiogenic potential of CM obtained from tumor cells + MSCs or from tumor cells + TNF\u03b1. Thus, additional studies were designed to provide another level of information on the ability of CM derived from the different groups to induce the migration of HPMEC in response to CM derived from different conditions. This assay enabled us to clearly demonstrate that the highest levels of endothelial cell migration were achieved when MDA-MB-231 cells interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 8A). Moreover, our findings emphasized the contribution of TNF\u03b1 to the angiogenic potential revealed by tumor cells grown in the presence of stromal cells.The pro-angiogenic activities of factors released by tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures are promoted by TNF\u03b1 in TNBC but not in luminal-A cells. Studies of endothelial cell (HPMEC) migration in response to CM derived from different cell combinations of MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) (A) and MCF-7 cells (B). (A1, B1) Representative photos of HPMEC migration in response to TNF\u03b1-free CM derived from TNF\u03b1-stimulated tumor:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (10 ng/ml), from tumor cells alone, from tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 alone and from tumor cells grown under \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs only. Bars, 50 \u03bcm. (A2, B2) Migrated HPMEC were counted in multiple photos per insert of the experiments presented in A1 and B1. ***p < 0.001, *p < 0.05, ns=non-significant for comparisons between CM of different cell combinations and CM of tumor cells treated by vehicle. Photos and their quantifications are representatives of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 3 different donors.We then performed parallel studies with luminal-A MCF-7 cells and found that CM of \u201cContact\u201d MCF-7:MSC co-cultures had strong angiogenic activities as with TNBC cells (Figure 8B); however, in contrast to our studies with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8A), in studies of MCF-7 cells TNF\u03b1 did not push the angiogenic response induced by CM of \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures any further.Tumor-Stroma-Inflammation Networks Promote the Migratory and Invasive Properties of TNBC CellsNext, we determined the effects of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network on tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. First, we found that in TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, the tumor cells acquired very elongated morphology (Figure 9A1) which is typical of cells that express high motility capabilities. The morphology of the tumor cells under this condition was robustly different from the morphology of tumor cells grown alone, of tumor cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1 and of tumor cells grown with MSCs only (Figure 9A1). These studies were followed by migration assays of MDA-MB-231 cells, known as having an aggressive phenotype which is manifested by a relatively high basal migratory potential. Despite their high basal motility, the interactions of MDA-MB-231 cells with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 have led to significantly higher migratory capacity of the tumor cells compared to tumor cells grown alone (Figure 9A2). Of note, MDA-MB-231 cells grown in the presence of MSCs only or with TNF\u03b1 alone did not migrate as well as tumor cells grown with MSCs and TNF\u03b1 (Figure 9A2). Supplementary Figure 4 demonstrates representative photos of MDA-MB-231 cells that migrated in the different study groups, identified by fluorescent staining.TNBC cells, and less so luminal-A cells, acquire migration-related characteristics upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1.

(B2) Migration of Hoechst-loaded MCF-7 cells was performed in response to medium containing 10% FBS for 21 h through fibronectin-coated membranes, in similar combinations as of MDA-MB-231 cells in Part (A) (TNF\u03b1: 10 ng/ml). ***p < 0.001; Representative photos of migrating cells are presented in Supplementary Figure 5. In all sections of Part (B), the Figures demonstrate representative experiments of n \u2265 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of \u22652 different donors.In parallel, experiments performed with MCF-7 cells indicated that their morphology was modified by TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 9B1) toward a metastasis-relevant phenotype [in line with our findings in ]. MCF-7 cells that grew in contact with MSCs also demonstrated modifications in their morphology, different than those induced by TNF\u03b1 stimulation. However, in contrast to our findings with MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A1), when TNF\u03b1 was added to MCF-7:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, no additivity was found between TNF\u03b1 and the MSCs in inducing more robust morphological changes in the tumor cells (Figure 9B1). Of note, the TNF\u03b1-stimulated MCF-7 cells that grew in co-culture with MSCs acquired elevated migratory capacity compared to control cells (Figure 9B2; Supplementary Figure 5). However, the overall migratory potential of MCF-7 cells at the tumor-stroma-inflammation setting (Figure 9B2) was much lower of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 9A2), although the two cell types were plated in same numbers in migration transwells. The relatively low migratory capacities of MCF-7 cells were noted despite the fact that they were given the proper conditions to support their migration (fibronectin coating of membranes and longer migration time than MDA-MB-231 cells).To follow up on these findings, we investigated the ability of TNBC cells to invade out of 3D spheroids, a process requiring migration and invasion through extracellular proteins. We noted significantly increased invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells when they interacted with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 10), compared to all other cell combinations. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells exerted significantly increased invasion also when they interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the context of TNF\u03b1 (Figure 11A; Please see \u201cNote\u201d in the legend of Figure 11A). In contrast to the TNBC cells, MCF-7 luminal-A cells that interacted with patient-derived CAFs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 demonstrated very minor, if any, invasive properties (Figure 11B), even after longer invasion time compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (96 h for MCF-7 cells; 48 h for MDA-MB-231 cells).TNBC cells acquire elevated invasive properties upon \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1. The Figure demonstrates tumor cell invasion out of 3D spheroids that were formed by mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) alone or by tumor cells in \u201cContact\u201d co-culturing with MSCs. The spheroids were imbedded into matrigel and then stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle for 48 h. (A) Representative photos. Bar, 200 \u03bcm.

To connect between these two processes, we asked if CXCL8 - selected because of its robust pro-angiogenic activities and pro-metastatic effects at the levels of TME and the tumor cells alike - was involved in mediating the functional properties of TNBC cells when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established.To this end, we generated TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in which CXCL8 was down-regulated in high efficiency by siRNA in the tumor cells and in the MSCs simultaneously [80\u201390% efficiency was found in CXCL8 down-regulation by the siRNA, similar to our findings in our parallel study; that study also demonstrates which of the cells contributed more to CXCL8 production when the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was established with MDA-MB-231 cells]. The findings of Figure 12 clearly indicate that CXCL8 played significant roles in driving forward all metastasis-related alterations that were induced by the tumor-stroma-inflammation network in TNBC. Here, we found that in the absence of CXCL8 expression, endothelial cell migration in response to CM of TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures was significantly reduced (Figure 12A). Moreover, upon CXCL8 down-regulation, the migration-relevant morphology of the tumor cells was partly reversed (Figure 12B), and the migration and particularly the invasion potentials of the tumor cells were significantly reduced (Figures 12C,D).Tumor-stroma-inflammation networks lead through CXCL8 activities to increased angiogenesis, invasion-related tumor cell morphology, tumor cell migration and invasion in TNBC cells. MDA-MB-231 cells (\u201cMDA\u201d) and MSCs were both transfected by siCXCL8 or siCTRL. Parallel studies indicated that the efficiency of CXCL8 down-regulation was high [80\u201390% in most experiments, as in; Data not shown]. The cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures and were stimulated by TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml); then, the cells or their CM were assayed in the following tests: (A) Endothelial cell migration (Procedures as in Figure 8A). ***p < 0.001; (B) Tumor cell morphology (Procedures as in Figure 9A1).

Yet, they have not directly determined the impact of the pro-inflammatory signals on tumor growth and metastasis when TNBC:stroma interactions are established. Our above findings motivated us to determine whether the pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 to TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures in vitro would potentiate tumor growth or metastasis in an animal model system.The ability of TNF\u03b1 to potentiate the in vivo aggressiveness of TNBC cells grown with MSCs requires that the in vitro advantages given to the tumor cells by their 3-day exposure to MSCs and to the cytokine, will persist in vivo (the cytokine is removed prior to injection to mice); Thus, we first determined whether the increased pro-metastatic capabilities endowed on the tumor cells by their co-culturing with stromal cells in the presence of TNF\u03b1 withhold when TNF\u03b1 is removed. To this end, TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures were established for 67 h with TNF\u03b1 stimulation, leading to high CXCL8 levels and clear changes in tumor cell morphology (Figures 13A,B); then, TNF\u03b1 was removed and the growth of TNBC:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures was continued in TNF\u03b1-deprived medium for ~2 weeks. The findings of Figure 13 demonstrate that the effects of TNF\u03b1 were reversible: ~2 weeks after TNF\u03b1 removal the elevation in CXCL8 was completely abolished (Figure 13A) and the elongated cell morphology was almost entirely diminished (Figure 13B).TNF\u03b1 promotes the metastatic potential of TNBC cells grown in contact with MSCs. (A,B) Reversibility of TNF\u03b1-induced tumor-promoting phenotypes, generated in vitro in \u201cContact\u201d MDA-MB-231:MSC co-cultures following TNF\u03b1 removal. mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were co-cultured in \u201cContact\u201d conditions with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control for 67 h (termed \u201c~3 days of TNF\u03b1 stimulation\") (A1,B1). Then, vehicle-treated and TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSCs co-cultures were re-cultured without further TNF\u03b1 stimulation for additional 10\u201314 days (termed \u201c~3 days of stimulation + ~2 weeks W/O TNF\u03b1 stimulation) (A2,B2). At both time points (~3 days and ~2 weeks), extracellular CXCL8 levels were determined in cell supernatants by ELISA (A) and tumor cell morphology was determined by fluorescent microscopy (B). ***p < 0.001, ns, not significant. Bar, 50 \u03bcm. In all panels of section (A,B), the results are representatives of n = 3 independent experiments, performed with MSCs of 2 different donors. (C,D) mCherry-MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 (10 ng/ml) or vehicle control, for 67 h (~3 days). Then, co-cultured cells were injected to the mammary fat pad of nude mice in 2 independent experiments (For additional experimental details please see \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d). Total mice numbers were: (1) In the group of mice administered with TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures: n = 12; (2) In the group of mice administered with vehicle-exposed co-cultures: n = 11. At the end of the experiment (~30 days post injection), primary tumor size was determined by volume (C1) and weight (C2). ns=non-significant. (D) Metastases in lungs were detected by mCherry signals using the Cri Maestro fluorescence imaging system. \u2227p = 0.095.Taking into account these findings on reversibility of TNF\u03b1-mediated effects, proposing that the benefits that were provided by TNF\u03b1 stimulation to TNBC:MSC co-cultures may not persist in vivo, we proceeded to the animal system setting. Here, we introduced an experimental design that will enable us to directly assess the impacts of TNF\u03b1 on the metastatic potential of TNBC cells when they interacted with stromal cells. To this end, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 for 67 h, and were compared to vehicle-exposed MDA-MB-231:MSC cultures, serving as controls. The cells were then administered to the mammary fat pads of female mice. To strengthen in vivo the possible effects of TNF\u03b1 when it acted on MDA-MB-231 and MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures, CM containing factors released by TNF\u03b1-stimulated MDA-MB-231:MSC \u201cContact\u201d co-cultures (but deprived of TNF\u03b1 itself) were injected in proximity to tumors generated by TNF\u03b1-stimulated co-cultures; in parallel, control media were administered to tumors arising from injection of vehicle-treated co-cultures. The findings of Figure 13C indicate that the sizes and weights of primary tumors were similar in the two groups of mice; however, most importantly, the metastatic potential of the tumor cells that interacted with MSCs was increased by in-culture TNF\u03b1 stimulation (Figure 13D). This effect was revealed by the elevated incidence of mice carrying lung metastases following MDA-MB-231 co-culturing with MSC under the influence of TNF\u03b1 in vitro, compared to the control group in which the co-cultured cells were not exposed to TNF\u03b1 (Figure 13D).DiscussionThe fundamental roles of the TME in promoting cancer progression are now well-appreciated, with stromal cells and pro-inflammatory elements being key contributors to disease development and metastasis. In the complex milieu that exists in tumors, cross-talks between the different TME players and the tumor cells eventually establish intricate networks whose roles in dictating disease course are still poorly defined and characterized.In the present study, we were particularly interested in elucidating the roles of tumor-stroma-inflammation networks in regulating tumor progression in TNBC, a most aggressive subtype of breast cancer. In our study, we have used potent and most clinically relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines - TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 - that are expressed in breast tumors and have pro-metastatic functions in TNBC. Our study provides novel findings indicating that interactions between TNBC cells and MSCs/CAFs in the presence of such pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to significantly enhanced pro-metastatic phenotypes of the TME and of the tumor cells themselves. This was illustrated by increased expression of pro-metastatic chemokines, by elevated ability to induce angiogenesis, as well as by higher migratory and invasive capabilities of the tumor cells. Ultimately, the end result of the activities of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network was a higher metastatic potential of TNBC cells in vivo.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network was found in our study to strongly induce the expression of the pro-metastatic chemokines CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5. These chemokines are pro-inflammatory factors and as such contribute to cancer inflammation by recruiting myeloid inflammatory cells, as well as immune-suppressive cells, to tumors and metastases. In addition, of the three chemokines, particularly CXCL8 but also CCL2, are potent angiogenic factors that contribute to TNBC progression. Moreover, direct activities of the chemokines on tumor cells have led to increased invasion in TNBC cells.As part of their pro-metastatic roles in TNBC, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors - for example, CXCR2 for CXCL8 and CCR2 for CCL2 - contributed to the pro-tumorigenic activities of stromal cells in TNBC mouse model systems. MSC/fibroblast-derived chemokines, including murine CXCL1 and CXCL2 (counterparts of human CXCL8), CCL2 and CCL5 were associated with recruitment of neutrophils, tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to TNBC tumors, where they promoted disease course. CXCL8 and CCL5, produced by bone marrow- and adipose-derived MSCs were prime inducers of metastasis in TNBC, acting by elevating the proliferation and invasive properties of the tumor cells, and their resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, MSC-derived CCL2 has attracted macrophages to TNBC tumors, activating them to secrete CXCL8, thus leading to an overall increase in tumor-associated macrophages and endothelial cells.The above studies strengthen the relevance and importance of our observations on the strong induction of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 when TNBC cells interacted with MSCs/CAFs in the context of pro-inflammatory stimuli, introduced by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. As noted above, both TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were found to be responsible for increased aggressiveness in TNBC, and in several studies were connected to increased pro-malignancy functions of MSCs/CAFs. For example, the findings by Shi and colleagues indicated that TNF\u03b1-activated MSCs promoted via CXCR2 and CCR2 ligands the metastatic ability of murine TNBC cells. TNF\u03b1-primed MSCs were also found to reprogram neutrophils to acquire immunosuppressive functions. Other studies demonstrated that MDA-MB-231-derived CM elevated IL-1\u03b2 release by MSCs, increasing their pro-inflammatory nature. In parallel, MSC-derived IL-1\u03b2 increased the proliferation and chemoresistance of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.However, these studies did not address the wider scope of the tumor-stroma-inflammation network, and did not identify the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in regulating TNBC-stroma interactions. Here, our current study provides novel findings, emphasizing the need for both TNBC:MSC cross-talk and pro-inflammatory signals delivered by TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, in order to achieve the most substantial levels of pro-metastatic activities: high levels of pro-metastatic chemokines, CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5, angiogenesis, and tumor cell migration and invasion. Moreover, our findings suggest that previous studies on TNF\u03b1-treated MSCs that induced anti-tumor activities in TNBC tumors may have overlooked the actual setting that takes place in vivo, when TNBC cells interact with MSCs in the presence of TNF\u03b1 stimulation.Of major importance in this context is the fact that CXCL8 was revealed in our current study as a key player in mediating the pro-metastatic functional effects of the inflammation-driven tumor-stroma networks in TNBC: angiogenesis, migration-related morphology of the tumor cells, as well as cancer cell migration and invasion. The effects of CXCL8 down-regulation on these pro-metastatic functions in TNBC was pronounced, and our results suggest that it can probably act in cooperativity with other factors that are produced under these network conditions to promote the aggressiveness of TNBC cells that interacted with stromal cells in the context of the pro-inflammatory TME.Here, it is interesting to note that the tumor-stroma-inflammation networks established by luminal-A cells were less potent or differently active than those generated in TNBC, in all aspects: chemokine production, angiogenesis, and tumor cell morphology, migration and invasion. These findings may reflect the fact that TNBC cells and luminal breast tumor cells interact differently with fibroblasts. They also agree well with our TCGA results demonstrating lower expression levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and of the three chemokines in luminal-A patients compared to basal patients. Ultimately, these findings may provide a partial explanation to the more aggressive clinical course of TNBC tumors compared to luminal-A tumors.Overall, our observations suggest that at the TME of TNBC tumors, which is enriched with TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, the two pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate tumor-stroma interactions that occur at the tumor site, and that under these conditions the in vivo aggressiveness of the tumor cells is increased. It would be interesting to establish similar systems with murine TNBC cells and investigate the possible effects of similar tumor-stroma-inflammation networks and of specific corresponding mouse chemokines on the immune and inflammatory contextures of mice tumors and metastases. Such systems may also enable further analyses that correlate the extent of stroma cell presence with the extent of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as with patterns of tumor cell migration and angiogenesis.The tumor-stroma-inflammation network identified in our study suggests that inhibiting the activities of TNBC-typical pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 would halt tumor-stroma interactions that stand in the basis of TNBC progression. Indeed, inhibitors of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are in clinical use in inflammatory diseases and were found to inhibit the aggressiveness phenotype of TNBC cells. Obviously, implementation of inhibitory modalities to these cytokines in the in vivo and even more so in the clinical setting would require improved understanding of the entire context of their activities; for example, the activation and regulatory networks of TNF\u03b1 and its TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors take place at multiple regulatory levels that need improved understanding.These considerations emphasize the relevance of the metastatic chemokines that are elevated due to the activity of the tumor-stroma-inflammation triage, particularly CXCL8, to therapy. Inhibitors of the axes of CXCL8, CCL2 and CCL5 and their receptors are also available, suggesting that treatments of TNBC cancers with combination therapies of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines may provide novel treatment options for TNBC patients.Ethics StatementAll procedures involving experimental animals were approved by Tel Aviv University Ethics Committee, and were performed in compliance with local animal welfare laws, guidelines, and policies.Author ContributionsYL generated all data, and was extensively engaged in study design and manuscript preparation.

This work reveals an unpredicted link between HSF1, Wnt signalling and YAP/TAZ relevant for the generation of tumour-promoting CAFs.It is unclear how specific signalling pathways are coordinated to generate pathologically activated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Here, Ferrari et al show that stromal expression of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) associates with aggressive tumours. DKK3 is a HSF-1 effector that activates \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ, and DKK3-driven YAP/TAZ activation regulates the pro-tumorigenic behaviour of CAFs.IntroductionStepwise acquisition of genetic alterations is crucial for the initiation of primary epithelial tumours. Yet, increasing evidence supports the notion that concomitant stromal changes play a critical role in cancer progression in many types of neoplasias. Fibroblasts constitute a significant proportion of the stromal compartment in many solid tumours. As opposed to normal fibroblasts, which are generally anti-tumorigenic, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) present a pathological activated phenotype that enables them to influence tumour progression, dissemination and response to therapy through remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and signalling to cancer, endothelial and immune cells. In CAFs, signalling pathways such as Heat-Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) and YAP/TAZ are activated in response to cellular stress and mechanical cues, respectively. In turn, HSF1 affects signalling to cancer cells promoting tumour growth whereas YAP promotes cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis through remodelling of the ECM. Thus, each pathway is regulated by different mechanisms and controls a defined set of functions; whether these molecular events are interconnected to regulate the emergence of a fully activated CAF phenotype is not known.Dickkopf (DKK) proteins comprise a conserved family of secreted negative regulators of \u03b2-catenin. DKK1, DKK2 and DKK4 have been shown to antagonise Wnt-mediated \u03b2-catenin stabilisation by binding and down-modulating Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6. In contrast, DKK3 does not interact with LRP5/6 and thus is not considered a true Wnt signalling antagonist. The role of DKK proteins in cancer is thought to be mainly tumour suppressive, as they are commonly downregulated in cancer cells and can negatively affect proliferation and survival. Yet, the role of DKK proteins in cancer stroma is still understudied.In this study we uncover an unprecedented role for DKK3 in linking HSF1 and YAP/TAZ signalling. We demonstrate that DKK3 is a HSF1 target gene that promotes aggressive behaviours in CAFs by potentiating YAP/TAZ activity via canonical Wnt signalling. Mechanistically, we show that DKK3 promotes LRP5/6 activity by interfering with the negative Wnt regulator Kremen1/2.ResultsDKK3 expression levels in the tumour microenvironmentDKK3 is upregulated in the stroma of breast, colon and ovarian cancers. a Tukey boxplots showing z-score values of DKK3 mRNA expression in normal and cancerous stroma from breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers (Breast: normal, n\u2009=\u20096; cancer, n\u2009=\u200953.

DKK3 gene and protein expression is significantly upregulated in the tumour stroma in several types of cancers including breast, colon and ovarian (Supplementary Figure\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01a\u2013c). Stromal expression of other DKK genes across various cancer types was less consistent (Supplementary Figure\u00a01a), suggesting that DKK3 is the only DKK factor commonly associated with cancer stroma. DKK3 protein levels in breast cancer (BC) stroma were significantly increased upon progression to more aggressive cancers, particularly in ER-negative BC (Fig.\u00a01d and Supplementary Figure\u00a01b). Furthermore, in ER-negative BC there was a significant association between high stromal DKK3 gene expression and poor outcome (Fig.\u00a01e). Analysis of human BC tissues showed that stromal DKK3 expression was restricted to vimentin-positive cells (Fig.\u00a01f), an expression pattern characteristic of CAFs. To investigate the cell of origin of DKK3 expression, we isolated different cell populations of murine MMTV-PyMT mammary carcinomas (Supplementary Figure\u00a01c&d, see Methods for details). Dkk3 expression was restricted to CAFs (Fig.\u00a01g). Similar findings were obtained in a human setting (Supplementary Figure\u00a01e). Stromal DKK3 expression in human tumours positively correlated with the expression of CAF markers ACTA2, FAP and COL1A2 (Fig.\u00a01h), supporting a link between DKK3 and CAFs. As DKK3 was restricted to CAFs in tumours, we investigated the prognostic potential of whole tumour DKK3 expression. These analyses indicated a significant correlation between DKK3 gene expression and poor outcome in ER-negative BC patients, as well as in colon and ovarian cancer patients (Fig.\u00a01i).DKK3 is a HSF1 target gene upregulated in CAFsDKK3 is a HSF1 target gene associated with CAF emergence. a Tukey boxplots showing z-score values of Dickkopft genes mRNA expression in murine mammary NFs and CAFs (NF, n\u2009=\u20096; CAF, n\u2009=\u20098). b Western blot showing protein levels of DKK3, DKK2, \u03b1SMA and tubulin in total lysates of two sets of murine mammary NFs and PyMT-CAFs.

Where indicated, individual p values are shown; alternatively the following symbols were used to describe statistical significance: *P\u2009<\u20090.05; **P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; #P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n.s., non-significantTo investigate DKK3 in tractable models, we isolated CAFs from murine mammary carcinomas and human breast, colon and ovarian cancers, as well as normal tissue counterparts (NFs). We observed consistent upregulation of DKK3 mRNA and protein levels in CAFs compared to NFs and cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02a, b and Supplementary Figure\u00a02a&b). Comprehensive analysis of these models indicated that DKK3 expression was stronger in FAP-positive CAFs (Supplementary Figure\u00a02b-d) but not necessarily associated with DKK3 secretion (Fig.\u00a02b). Noteworthy, the DKK gene DKK2 also showed a significant enrichment in the cancerous stroma of some tumour types (Supplementary Figure\u00a01a). However, DKK2 expression was not restricted to CAFs in murine or human tumours (Fig.\u00a01g and Supplementary Figure\u00a01d&e), nor upregulated in murine or human CAFs when compared to NFs (Fig.\u00a02a, b and Supplementary Figure\u00a02b). In addition, no association between DKK2 expression and poor outcome was observed in ER-negative BC, colon and ovarian cancer patients (Fig.\u00a01i). For these reasons, we decided to focus on studying the role of DKK3 in CAFs.To investigate the mechanism leading to DKK3 upregulation in CAFs, we first analysed the ChEA Transcription Factor Binding Site dataset in the Enrich database. This informed of 58 transcription factors that potentially bind the DKK3 promoter (Fig.\u00a02c). Of these, HSF1 was the only factor to positively modulate DKK3 expression in perturbation assays. This was further confirmed in two independent datasets involving Hsf1 deletion in fibroblasts (Supplementary Figure\u00a02e). HSF1 is a transcription factor that can be activated by stresses such as oxidative stress, nutrient-deprivation and protein misfolding, which are commonly found in the tumour microenvironment. HSF1 has been associated to aggressive CAF behaviours by its ability to drive a transcriptional programme that supports the malignant potential of cancer in a non-cell-autonomous way. Silencing Hsf1 expression reduced Dkk3 mRNA and protein expression in CAFs (Fig.\u00a02f, g). Furthermore, HSF1 activity strongly correlated with DKK3 gene expression in the stromal compartment of human tumours (Fig.\u00a02h). Next, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-HSF1 antibodies and extracts from murine NF and CAFs. Fig.\u00a02i shows that Hsf1 was significantly more associated with the bona fide HSF1 target gene Rilpl in CAFs. Further, Hsf1 interacted with promoter and enhancer regions of the Dkk3 locus, and this association was significantly increased in CAFs.DKK3 modulates pro-tumorigenic functions in CAFsDKK3 is a crucial regulator of CAF functions. a Western blots showing DKK3 and Gapdh expression in murine CAF1 after transfection with control (siCtr) and 2 independent DKK3 siRNAs (si#2 and si#3). b Colour-coded grid showing fold expression of genes generally associated to CAFs in NF4 and wild-type CAF1 after transfection with control and 2 different DKK3 siRNAs.

Knocking-down Dkk3 did not affect the expression of genes associated to CAF phenotypes (Fig.\u00a03b). However, the ability of CAFs to contract collagen gels, a measure of their matrix remodelling capacity, was dependent on Dkk3 expression (Fig.\u00a03c). Decreased gel contraction in Dkk3-siRNA CAFs was associated with thinner collagen fibres (Fig.\u00a03d) and a significant decrease in matrix stiffness (Fig.\u00a03e). Similar findings were obtained in CAF5 (Supplementary Figure\u00a03a), a CAF line that did not secrete Dkk3 (Fig.\u00a02b). For long-term functional analyses, we generated Dkk3 knockout CAFs (CAF-KO) and CAF-KO re-expressing Dkk3 (CAF-KO-REC)(Supplementary Figure\u00a03b and Fig.\u00a03f). Validating our previous results, Dkk3-null CAFs presented significantly less ECM remodelling activity (Supplementary Figure\u00a03c, d). In three-dimensional (3D) co-culture models (Fig.\u00a03g), CAFs promoted cancer cell invasion and growth of murine MMTV-PyMT TS1 cancer cells, and this ability was dependent on Dkk3 expression (Fig.\u00a03h, i). These results were further validated using alternative approaches (i.e. matrigel on top) (Supplementary Figure\u00a03e&f) and in human patient-derived CAFs from breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers (Supplementary Figure\u00a04). Conversely, forcing DKK3 expression in NFs (Supplementary Figure\u00a05a) significantly increased their abilities to remodel collagen matrices and promote TS1 invasion (Supplementary Figure\u00a05b&c). In CAFs, HSF1 promotes tumour growth by inducing the production of secreted factors such as TGF\u03b2 and SDF1. Using recombinant DKK3 and CAF-derived conditioned media from WT, KO and KO-REC CAFs we observed that secreted DKK3 had no effect on cancer cell proliferation and motility (Supplementary Figure\u00a05d). Validating these results, we observed no significant differences in cancer cell proliferation or motility between cells treated with conditioned media from CAF1 (detectable secreted DKK3, as per Fig.\u00a02b) or CAF5 (no detectable secreted DKK3), or in the presence of a blocking antibody against DKK3 (Supplementary Figure\u00a05e). In addition, secreted DKK3 was not able to recover the functional defects associated to loss of DKK3 in CAFs (Supplementary Figure\u00a05f). Thus, DKK3 is a novel HSF1 target gene that regulates ECM remodelling and associated cancer cell growth and invasion; unlike other HSF1 target genes such as TGF\u03b2 or SDF1, DKK3 does not have any apparent secreted function.DKK3 is required for the tumour-promoting activities of CAFs in vivoDKK3 promotes the pro-tumorigenic behaviour of CAFs in vivo. a Cartoon describing the experimental set-up used to assess the tumour-promoting potential of CAFs in vivo by subcutaneous co-injection of TS1 murine cancer cells and indicated CAFs. b Graph showing the volumes of tumours in syngeneic mice (FVB/n) at the indicated days post-injection.

Conversely, ectopic expression of DKK3 in NF significantly increased their ability to promote tumour growth in vivo (Supplementary Figure\u00a05g). Histological analysis revealed that TS1\u2009+\u2009WT-CAF or TS1\u2009+\u2009KO-REC-CAF tumours shared a poorly differentiated morphology and invasive phenotypes typical of high-grade tumours, with loss of basal lamina (i.e. laminin staining), despite having similar number of \u03b1SMA-positive CAFs (Fig.\u00a05d). In contrast, TS1\u2009+\u2009KO-CAFs tumours had a more differentiated architecture where cancer cell acini where surrounded by laminin-rich areas. Fibronectin and Masson\u2019s trichrome staining revealed increased ECM deposition at the tumour border in TS1\u2009+\u2009WT-CAF and TS1\u2009+\u2009KO-REC-CAF tumours, suggesting a higher reactive stroma. Second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging confirmed these findings as TS1\u2009+\u2009WT-CAFs tumours presented a higher content of collagen fibres than TS1\u2009+\u2009KO-CAF tumours (Fig.\u00a05f). These ECM characteristics have been linked with aggressive CAF phenotypes as they promote cancer cell motility and local invasion. In agreement, we observed areas at the tumour border where cancer cells were invading in TS1\u2009+\u2009WT-CAFs tumours (Fig.\u00a05f, asterisk). Using intravital imaging we confirmed this as co-injection of TS1 cells and WT-CAFs produced tumours where both cancer cells and CAFs were highly motile (Supplementary Movie\u00a01; Fig.\u00a05g, h). In contrast, motility in tumours with KO-CAFs was severely impaired (Supplementary Movie\u00a02; Fig.\u00a05h).DKK3 in CAFs potentiates Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ signallingTo understand the molecular mechanism whereby DKK3 exerts its functions and how HSF1 connects to other signalling pathways, we performed global transcriptomic profiling of murine CAFs after Dkk3 silencing. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant decrease in the expression of genes associated with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ activities (Fig.\u00a05a, Supplementary Figure\u00a06a and Supplementary Table\u00a01). \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ are transcriptional regulators with paramount roles in development and cancer. In CAFs, YAP establishes a transcriptional programme that enhances matrix remodelling and invasion of neighbouring cancer cells. \u03b2-catenin plays a pivotal role in fibrotic disorders, but its relevance in modulating CAF functions is still not well understood. Dkk3 knock-down decreased levels of non-phosphorylated (active) \u03b2-catenin and TAZ levels (Fig.\u00a05b), reduced nuclear YAP/TAZ localisation (Fig.\u00a05c) and inhibited \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity (Fig.\u00a05d). These findings were confirmed using Dkk3 knockout/recovery system (Supplementary Figure\u00a06b&c) and patient-derived CAFs (Supplementary Figure\u00a06d-f). Conversely, ectopic expression of DKK3 in human NFs increased non-phosphorylated (active) \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ levels (Supplementary Figure\u00a06g). Furthermore, we observed reduced \u03b2-catenin and YAP staining in DKK3-null CAFs in vivo (Fig.\u00a05e, f), and DKK3 expression significantly correlated with YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin signatures in human cancer stroma (Fig.\u00a05g). We confirmed that \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ were activated in murine and human CAFs (Fig.\u00a05h and Supplementary Figure\u00a07a&b), and in the stroma of breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers (Supplementary Figure\u00a07c).DKK3 regulates CAF functions via YAP/TAZDKK3 promotes aggressive behaviours in CAFs via YAP/TAZ. a Western blots showing \u03b2-catenin, YAP, TAZ, pY416-Src (pSRC), pS19-MLC2 (pMLC2) and Tubulin in CAF1 following transfection with control (siCtr), \u03b2-catenin (si\u03b2cat; smart-pool) or YAP/TAZ (siY/T; smart-pool) siRNAs. b Tukey boxplot shows gel contraction of CAF1 transfected as in (a); n\u2009=\u20098 gels except for siY/T that n\u2009=\u20096. c Tukey boxplot shows invasion index (3D invasion) measured from TS1 spheroids obtained after 3D co-culture with CAF1 transfected as in (a); n\u2009>\u200932 individual spheroids out of 3 independent experiments. d Representative images of end-point TS1 (red) MOT co-culture with CAF1 transfected as in (a).

HSF1 in CAFs upregulates DKK3 which in turn potentiates YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin signalling. YAP promotes actomyosin contractility leading to ECM remodelling and cancer cell growth and invasion. The role of \u03b2-catenin is still undetermined. i Western blots show Hsf1, non-phospho (active) \u03b2-catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41), \u03b2-catenin, YAP, TAZ, pS19-MLC2 (pMLC2) and Tubulin in murine CAF1 and CAF5 after transfection with control (siCtr) or Hsf1 (smart-pool) siRNAs. j Graph shows gel contraction of CAF-WT, CAF-KO.9-REC and CAF-KO.9-YAPS5A after transfection with control (siCtr) or Hsf1 (smart-pool) siRNAs.

Contrary to YAP/TAZ silencing, knocking-down \u03b2-catenin (Fig.\u00a06a) had no effect in the ability of CAFs to contract collagen-rich matrices (Fig.\u00a06b), or promote cancer cell invasion and growth in 3D (Fig.\u00a06c, d). Loss of YAP/TAZ function in CAFs leads to MLC2 and Src inactivation and reduced actomyosin contractility, which affects the ability of CAFs to remodel the ECM. Dkk3 knockdown was associated with reduced phospho-MLC2 and phospho-Src levels (Supplementary Figure\u00a07d). \u03b2-catenin siRNA treatment did not affect MLC2 or Src activation (Fig.\u00a06a), suggesting that DKK3 loss-of-function is primarily associated to its effect on YAP/TAZ activity. Confirming this, expression of a constitutively active mutant of YAP in Dkk3-null CAFs was able to recover their gel remodelling and cancer cell growth promoting abilities (Fig.\u00a06e, f). Both DKK3 and YAP gain-of-function phenotypes were associated with reactivation of actomyosin contractility and Src (Fig.\u00a06g). Overall, these data supported a model where HSF1 in CAFs leads to DKK3 upregulation, which in turn potentiates YAP/TAZ activity leading to increased ECM remodelling and promotion of cancer cell growth and invasion (Fig.\u00a06h). In agreement, we observed that silencing Hsf1 in CAFs led to \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ inactivation (Fig.\u00a06i and Supplementary Figure\u00a07e) and was associated with a reduction in the matrix remodelling activity of CAFs (Fig.\u00a06j). However, these defects were prevented by constitutive expression of DKK3 or YAPS5A.DKK3 potentiates canonical Wnt signalling in CAFsWe next investigated the molecular mechanism whereby DKK3 modulates YAP/TAZ. We observed that the expression levels of key regulators of YAP/TAZ function, MST1/2 and LATS kinases, was marginally affected in one of the Dkk3-null clones (i.e. KO.9) when compared to wild-type and KO-REC CAFs (Supplementary Figure\u00a08a). However, analysis of YAP S127 phosphorylation, the main maker of Hippo activity over YAP, showed no differences after DKK3 modulation. This suggested that DKK3 might be acting independently of Hippo signalling. To confirm this, we silenced LATS1&2 expression in wild type and KO.9 CAFs and assessed CAF functions (Supplementary Figure\u00a08b). Silencing LATS1&2 increased the abilities of CAFs to remodel gels and promote cancer cell growth (Supplementary Figure\u00a08c, d), in line with their negative role in YAP function. However, the presence or absence of DKK3 did not significantly alter the effect of inhibiting Hippo signalling in CAF activities or YAP/TAZ levels, excluding a role for Hippo kinases in YAP/TAZ activation through DKK3.DKK3 potentiates canonical Wnt signalling and affects YAP/\u03b2-catenin degradation. a Western blots show \u03b2-catenin, TAZ, YAP and tubulin expression in murine WT and KO.9 CAFs after treatment with 100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121 cycloheximide (CHX) for the indicated times (in min).

Thus, association of LRP5/6 co-receptors with Axin1 in response to Wnt stimulation displaces \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ from the destruction complex. In the absence of LRP5/6 signal, Axin1 targets \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ for degradation. Gene expression analyses indicated that modulating DKK3 expression levels did not alter the expression of Wnt signalling regulators (Supplementary Figure\u00a08e). However, our previous data suggested that DKK3 depletion/ectopic expression was affecting \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ protein expression (Supplementary Figures\u00a06b&g and Supplementary Figure\u00a08a). To confirm whether DKK3 was affecting the activity of the destruction complex, we performed cycloheximide-chase assays. Fig.\u00a07a shows that the protein stability of \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ was severely affected in the absence of DKK3. Further analyses revealed that LRP6 levels at the cell surface were diminished when Dkk3 was knocked-out (Fig.\u00a07b), suggesting that DKK3 was affecting YAP/TAZ activity and CAF functions at the level of LRP5/6. In agreement, targeting Lrp5/6 expression in WT-CAFs (Supplementary Figure\u00a08f), attenuated \u03b2-catenin and YAP activation (Fig.\u00a07c and Supplementary Figure\u00a08f) and diminished their tumour-promoting activities (Fig.\u00a07d, e). Yet, silencing Lrp5/6 expression in Dkk3-null CAFs had no functional consequences. Inhibiting canonical Wnt signalling with XAV939 yielded similar results (Supplementary Figure\u00a07g&h), suggesting that this was a canonical Wnt-related function. To further confirm this, we investigated the role of DKK3 in CAFs after Wnt ligand stimulation. We observed that stimulation of wild type and Dkk3-null CAFs with canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3a induced a significant increase in their basal (i.e. low serum) gel remodelling activities, whereas non-canonical Wnt5a stimulation had no effect (Fig.\u00a07f). Even though DKK3 was not absolutely required for CAFs to respond to Wnt3a, the gel remodelling activities of CAFs after Wnt3a stimulation were significantly reduced in the absence of DKK3. Importantly, these effects were concomitant with \u03b2-catenin and YAP activation (Fig.\u00a07g, h), indicating that DKK3 promotes YAP/TAZ signalling by potentiating Wnt signalling in CAFs.DKK3 disable the negative Wnt regulator Kremen1&2 in CAFsDKK3 regulates the balance between LRP6 and Kremen and affects YAP/TAZ signalling. a Western blots show anti-Flag co-immune-precipitation of LRP6 and Kremen1 in human BC-CAFs (TB147) expressing Flag-DKK3 or empty vector (null). b Images show DKK3 (green), Kremen1 (red) and DAPI (blue) staining of human BC-CAF TB165 after transfection with control (siCtr) and DKK3 siRNA (smart-pool).

This is in striking contrast with our observations on the role of DKK3 in CAFs, and underline the functional differences of DKK proteins reported in other systems. DKK3 is an unusual member of the family as it does not interact with LRP5/6 but still can interact with Kremen. Using HEK293T cells, it has been proposed that DKK3-Kremen interaction negatively affects surface expression of Kremen, which may favour canonical Wnt signalling by still unclear mechanisms. We first confirmed that Kremen1 but not LRP6 immunoprecipitated with DKK3 in CAFs (Fig.\u00a08a). In addition, DKK3-Kremen1 co-localised to internal structures; however, after DKK3 silencing Kremen1 localised to the cell periphery (Fig.\u00a08b), in an opposite pattern to LRP6 localisation (Fig.\u00a08c). Interestingly, DKK3 expression was inversely associated to changes in Kremen1&2 protein expression (Fig.\u00a08d). mRNA levels of Kremen1/2 were not altered after Dkk3 silencing (Supplementary Figure\u00a08e), suggesting a post-translational regulation. Cycloheximide-chase assays confirmed that Kremen1 was less stable in WT-CAFs than in Dkk3-null CAFs whereas LRP6 stability was increased (Fig.\u00a08e). Our data suggested that disabling Kremen activity may restore LRP6 functions in the absence of DKK3 expression. In agreement, silencing Kremen receptors in Dkk3-null CAFs (Fig.\u00a08f) increased their abilities to remodel gels (Fig.\u00a08g) and promoted cancer cell growth and invasion (Fig.\u00a08h, i). These changes were associated with concomitant re-localisation of LRP6 to the cell surface (Fig.\u00a08j) and reactivation of YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin signalling (Fig.\u00a08f, k). Conversely, knocking-down Kremen1&2 in DKK3-expressing CAFs had no functional consequences (Supplementary Figure\u00a08i).Model depicting the proposed mechanism of DKK3-mediated regulation of YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin in CAFs. On CAFs, DKK3 destabilises Wnt negative regulator Kremen leading to increased LRP6 membrane localisation, which in turn stabilises YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin levels via canonical Wnt. Whereas \u03b2-catenin signalling is dispensable for CAFs to remodel the ECM and promote cancer cell growth and invasion, DKK3-driven YAP activation is required to induce a tumour-promoting phenotype. Absence of DKK3 in DKK3-null CAFs and NFs is associated with decreased YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin activity. In CAFs, loss of DKK3 leads to concomitant upregulation of Kremen, LRP6 inactivation and YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin destabilization. In this scenario, depletion of Kremen1/2 is able to rescue LRP6 membrane localisation and YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin activityOverall, our mechanistic analyses support a model whereby DKK3 stabilises the cell-surface levels of LRP6 by uncoupling LRP6 from the Kremen-mediated internalisation machinery. In turn, DKK3-mediated LRP6 regulation leads to activation of \u03b2-catenin and YAP/TAZ, with the latter being the main mediator of DKK3 functions (Fig.\u00a09).DiscussionSecreted DKK proteins are emerging as unpredicted tumour-promoting factors due to their immune-suppressive activities. Here, we demonstrate that the family member DKK3 can also promote aggressive behaviours in CAFs in a cell autonomous manner. DKK3 reduces YAP/TAZ degradation by potentiating Wnt signalling, thus acting in parallel to YAP/TAZ regulation via mechanotransduction. DKK3 also activates \u03b2-catenin in CAFs and we document that cancer stroma and CAFs present increased \u03b2-catenin activity. However, inhibition of \u03b2-catenin by RNAi did not affect CAF-mediated ECM remodelling, cancer cell growth and invasion. Further studies are required to determine if \u03b2-catenin modulates other pro-tumorigenic functions in CAFs such as potentiating the tumour initiating capacity of cancer cells or immune suppression. The role of DKK3 as a positive regulator of canonical Wnt is in contrast to the well documented role of other DKK family members. Here, we provide mechanistic insights into these differences. Contrary to what has been shown for DKK1 and DKK2, we show that DKK3 does not bind LRP6 co-receptor in CAFs, and therefore cannot fulfil the bona fide antagonist role of DKK proteins in canonical Wnt signalling. By contrast, we demonstrate that DKK3 perturbs the negative regulator Kremen and enhances Wnt signalling via LRP6.Whilst several CAF effectors have been identified, an unanswered question is how the coordination of different signalling pathways involved in their control is established. Our results suggest that HSF1-dependent DKK3 upregulation could be a response of stromal fibroblasts to stresses found in the tumour microenvironment. In turn, DKK3 expression promotes fibroblast activation as it sustains crucial activating pathways. Thus, DKK3 expression potentiates canonical Wnt signalling, leading to reduced YAP/TAZ degradation. This leads to YAP/TAZ activation, ECM stiffening and the generation of aggressive tumour microenvironments. We propose that this may be a mechanism for tumour-promoting CAFs to be selected as tumour progresses and a plausible mechanism explaining its significant enrichment in cancer stroma. Further work is still required to understand the processes modulating HSF1 activity in CAFs, and whether the axis HSF1-DKK3-YAP is also relevant in other systems.To conclude, we identify a key role of DKK3 in tumour stroma. It is required for many of the pro-tumorigenic functions of CAFs, including matrix stiffening and cancer cell growth and invasion. High levels of DKK3 in the stroma are sustained by HSF1, potentiate Wnt signalling and reduce YAP/TAZ degradation. Thus, DKK3 acts as a crucial integrator of key molecular players modulating the emergence of tumour-promoting phenotypes in CAFs.MethodsMouse strainsTransgenic FVB/n mice expressing the Polyoma Middle T antigen oncogene under the Mouse Mammary Tumour Virus promoter (MMTV-PyMT) were used for tumour cell isolation and FACS analysis. Wild-type FVB/n and CD-1 Nude mice (Charles River) were used as recipients for tumours. All animals were kept in accordance with UK regulations under project license PPL80/2368.Cell linesEstablished murine fibroblasts from FVB/n normal mammary glands (NFs) and MMTV-PyMT mammary carcinoma (CAFs) have been previously described. Human fibroblasts from normal mammary glands and breast carcinomas were provided by Julia Tchou (University of Pennsilvania, USA) and Clare Isacke (Institute of Cancer Research, UK). Human fibroblasts from rectal carcinomas (RC11), colon carcinomas (CAF25) and adjacent normal tissue (NAD-D) were provided by Danijela Vignjevic (Institute Curie, France). Human fibroblasts from ovarian carcinoma (EOC.TIL.04) were provided by Marco Donia (University of Copenhagen, Denmark). Human CAFs from cervical (Cer-CAF) squamous cell carcinoma have been previously described. Human primary fibroblasts were expanded and immortalised using hTERT virus (pCSII vector backbone) followed by selection with hygromycin. All resulting fibroblast populations were assessed for fibroblast and CAF marker expression and thoroughly characterised. All fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS, 1% insulin-selenium-transferrin (ITS, Gibco). MMTV-PyMT TS1 murine breast cancer cells were used in most assays and to generate tumours in syngeneic FVB/n mice. Human breast cancer cell line BT20 was cultured in MEM plus GlutaMAX and 10% FBS. Colon cancer cell line HCT116 was grown in McCoy 5\u2009A (with 1% GlutaMAX and 10% FCS). Ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 was grown in RPMI with 1% GlutaMAX, 10% FBS and 1% Pyruvate. All cell lines were grown in a standard humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C and tested negative for mycoplasma infection with MycoAlertTM (Lonza). CAFs and cancer cell lines were fluorescently labelled using the following lentiviral vectors, as indicated: EGFP-CAAX pCSII-IRES2-hygro, ECFP-CAAX pCSII-IRES2-hygro, ORANGE-CAAX PCSII-IRES2-hygro, mCherry-CAAX pCSII-IRES2-hygro and pCSII-IRES2-blasti-eGFP.cDNA, RNAi and reagentsDKK3 (a kind gift by Peter Berger, University of Innsbruck) was ectopically expressed in CAF/NFs lines using a pLENTI6 lentiviral vector system. shRNAs targeting human DKK3 were cloned into the lentiviral vector pLKO.1-TRC-cloning vector (Addgene, Plasmid #10878) at AgeI/EcoRI restriction sites according to the online Addgene protocol (www.addgene.org/tools/protocols/plko). shRNA sequences were obtained from the GPP Web Portal (Broad Institute, http://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/). A list of the respective shRNA sequences can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a03. siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon and are listed in the Supplementary Table\u00a04. For in vitro treatments the following growth factors and drugs were used: recombinant human DKK3 (R&D, 1118-DK-050), XAV939 (Sigma, X3004), Cycloheximide (Sigma, C7698), Wnt3a (R&D, 5036-WN-010) and Wnt5a (R&D, 645-WN-010). Lentiviral plasmid for expression of mutant YAP was 5SA-YAP1-YFP vector (kind gift of Eric Sahai, Crick Institute).Generation of CRISPR knockout cell linesThe CRISPR plasmid U6-gRNA/CMV-Cas9-GFP containing a guide RNA targeting mouse DKK3 was purchased from Sigma (MM0000346166). CAF1 cells (CAF-WT) were transfected with the plasmid using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions and GFP positive cells were single sorted into 96 well plates after 24\u2009h. GFP-negative clones were also sorted as controls (e.g. WT.9). Individual cell clones were expanded and the DKK3 locus targeted by CRISPR was sequenced for knockout validation. In addition, loss of DKK3 protein expression was also confirmed by immunoblotting to generate DKK3-null CAFs (CAF-KO). DKK3-null clones were infected with DKK3-expressing lentivirus to generate KO-CAFs re-expressing DKK3 (CAF-KO-REC).Conditioned mediaCAF-derived conditioned media was generated by culturing a confluent monolayer of cells in DMEM 2.5% or 5% FBS for 48\u2009h. Media was then recovered and filtered through a 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filter and used as indicated. For detection of DKK3 in the conditioned media, 50\u2009\u03bcL of StrataClean resin (Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, 400714) were added to 1\u2009mL of media. Each sample was vortexed for 1\u2009min, left at RT for 1\u2009min and spun 15,000\u00d7 g for 5\u2009min at 4\u2009\u00b0C. The supernatant was then removed and the beads were prepared in protein sample buffer to be resolved in SDS-PAGE.TransfectionsFibroblasts were seeded at 60% confluency and transfected using DharmaFECT 1 (Dharmacon) for siRNA (100\u2009nM final concentration), and Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) for plasmids following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cell lines stably expressing cDNA (DKK3 or GFP/CFP/mCherry) or shRNAs were generated by lentiviral infection followed by puromycin selection for 2 weeks (2\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL\u22121). Alternatively, fluorescent-labelled cells were sorted by FACS.ECM-remodelling assayTo assess force-mediated matrix remodelling, 7.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 murine fibroblasts or 3\u20135\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 human fibroblasts were embedded in 120\u2009\u00b5L of a mixture of collagen I (BD Biosciences) and ECM gel mixture (Sigma) yielding a final collagen concentration of ~4.6\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 and a final ECM gel mix concentration of ~2.2\u2009mg\u2009mL\u22121 (Collagen-rich matrix hereafter). Once the gel was set, cells were maintained in fibroblasts medium. Gel contraction was monitored daily by scanning the plates. Unless stated otherwise, the gel contraction value refers to the contraction observed after 2 days. To obtain the gel contraction value, the relative diameter of the well and the gel were measured using ImageJ software, and the percentage of contraction was calculated using the formula 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009(well area\u2009\u2212\u2009gel area)\u2009/\u2009well area. When indicated, gels were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 16\u2009h and processed for immunofluorescence. Backscattered light (reflectance) was collected to image the matrix surrounding cells. Alternatively, collagen second-harmonic generation (SHG) signal was acquired by exciting with an 880\u2009nm pulsed Ti\u2013Sapphire laser and acquiring emitted light at 440\u2009nm using a Leica SP8 microscope.3D co-cultureThe 3D co-culture spheroid assay was adapted from Dolznig et al. In short, cancer cells were seeded in low numbers (200 cells per well TS1-mCherry, 50 cells per well HCT116-mCherry, 150 cells per well BT20-GFP and SKOV3-orange) in ultra-low adherent cell culture plates (Corning) to form spheroids for 48\u2009h. The spheroids were collected and mixed with 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 fibroblasts. The spheroid and fibroblast suspension was centrifuged at 200\u00d7 g for 4\u2009min and the supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was first re-suspended in 30\u2009\u00b5L of medium and then mixed with 270\u2009\u00b5L of Collagen-rich matrix. The 300\u2009\u00b5L gel containing the spheroids and fibroblasts was seeded in a glass-bottom 3.5\u2009cm MatTek dish. A nylon filter (Nylon NET filters 120 \u03bcm, Merck Millipore) with a hole of ~1\u2009cm diameter cut out at the centre was added to prevent excessive gel contraction. The gel was set for 1\u2009h in the incubator at 37\u2009\u02daC and cancer cell medium was added. The spheroids were incubated for 5\u20137 days (3\u20135 days for studies involving siRNA-transfected CAFs) and then fixed with 4% PFA and either imaged directly or stained additionally with DAPI and phalloidin-TRITC or phalloidin-FITC. Samples were mounted and analysed using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Confocal sections were acquired for individual spheroids from bottom to top, z-stack projections were analysed using ImageJ and data analysed in GraphPad Prism. The invasion index was calculated by measuring the total area over which cancer cells had dispersed (including invading and non-invading cells) and the area of non-invading cells (1 \u2013 [non-invading area/total area]). To calculate tumour growth index, area covered by cancer cells in each spheroid was calculated.Matrigel on Top (MOT) co-culture24-well MatTek glass bottom plates were pre-coated with 100\u2009\u00b5L of Matrigel. Next, 6\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 CAFs per well were seeded, unless otherwise stated. After 1\u2009h, fluorescently labelled cancer cells (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 per well) were seeded and allowed to adhere for 4\u2009h. Growth medium was exchanged to DMEM 2.5% FCS and 2% Matrigel and co-cultures were allowed to grow for 48\u2009h, or up to 120\u2009h for the ovarian cells. Co-cultures were then fixed in 4% PFA and analysed by confocal microscopy. Images were analysed using ImageJ and data analysed in GraphPad Prism. To calculate cancer cell growth index, area covered by cancer cells in each field of view was calculated.Atomic force microscopyTo assess the elastic modulus of gels remodelled by fibroblasts, 75\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 fibroblasts were embedded in 100\u2009\u00b5L of Collagen-rich matrx and seeded on ultra-low attachment 96-well plate (Costar). Once the gels were set, they were maintained in fibroblast medium. After three days, the elastic modulus of the gels was measured as previously described. Gels were gently lifted from their well and fixed in the centre of 50\u2009mm glass bottom Petri dishes using cyanoacrylate superglue. Once glued, Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS was added to the dish. AFM measurements were performed with a JPK Nanowizard-I (JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany) interfaced to an inverted optical microscope (IX-81, Olympus). AFM cantilevers with pyramidal tips (MLCT, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) and nominal spring constants of 0.07\u2009Nm\u22121 were modified by gluing 35-\u03bcm radius glass beads to the cantilever underside with UV curing glue (UV curing, Loctite, UK). Cantilever spring constants were determined prior to modification using the thermal noise method implemented in the AFM software (JPK SPM). Prior to any indentation tests, the sensitivity of the cantilever was set by measuring the slope of force-distance curves acquired on glass regions of the Petri dish. Using the optical microscope, the tip of the cantilever was aligned over regions in the middle of the gel and, for each gel, measurements were acquired in 30\u201340 locations ~100\u2009\u03bcm apart. Force-distance curves were acquired with an approach speed of 5\u2009\u03bcm.s\u22121 until reaching the maximum set force of 3\u2009nN. After the experiment, the elastic moduli were extracted from the force-distance curves by fitting the contact portion of curves to a Hertz contact model. For each force-distance curve, goodness of fit was evaluated by calculating r^2 values and only fits with r^2\u2009>\u20090.80 were retained for further analyses (representing on average 80% of the acquired force-curves).ImmunofluorescenceCells were fixed in 4% PFA for 1\u2009h and permeabilised by incubation in PBS 0.2% Triton 100 (Sigma) at RT for 20\u2009min. For HSF1 immunofluorescence, cells were permeabilised by incubation in PBS 0.5% NP-40 (Sigma) at 4\u2009\u00b0C for 20\u2009min (twice), in PBS 0.3% Triton 100 (Sigma) at RT for 20\u2009min and in PBS 0.1% Triton 100 at RT for 15\u2009min (twice). Where indicated (non-permeabilised), this step was not performed. Samples were blocked for 60\u2009min at RT in blocking solution: 4% BSA PBS 0.05% Tween20 (Sigma). Then, cells were incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution in a wet chamber overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C. After three washes of 15\u2009min in PBS, secondary antibody in blocking solution was added for 3\u2009h. After three washes of 15\u2009min in PBS, the samples were mounted and analysed using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. To quantify \u03b2-catenin activation by immunofluorescence, for each field of view we calculated the area positive for active-\u03b2-catenin staining per cell using Volocity. These values were then normalised to the mean value of CAF-WT (murine CAFs) or control siRNA-transfected cells (human CAFs). To quantify YAP and TAZ activation by immunofluorescence, we measured their nuclear localisation using Volocity. Briefly, we calculated for each cell the total intensity of nuclear HSF1, YAP or TAZ staining (determined by the intensity within the region delimited by DAPI staining) and perinuclear staining (defined as a region encompassing two to seven pixels from the nucleus border). Nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ ratios were calculated as the log10 of the total nuclear intensity/mean perinuclear region intensity per cell. For the analysis of human CAFs, nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP and TAZ ratios were normalised to the mean ratio of control siRNA-transfected cells. Antibody description and working dilutions can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a02.Tissue immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescenceFor histological analysis, tumours were dissected into 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin blocks and serial sections were taken. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were rehydrated before antigen retrieval using pH 6 sodium citrate buffer. After blocking endogenous peroxidase (DAKO peroxidase block), sections were incubated for 1\u2009h at RT with primary antibodies. For DKK3 staining, four antibodies (Abgent AP1523a, R&D AF1118, Sigma HPA011868 and Santa-Cruz H130) were tested for specificity using western blot and cell pellets in control and DKK3-silenced CAFs, and then optimised for TMA analysis. Both Sigma and Santa-Cruz antibodies yielded satisfactory results. Data presented correspond to Santa-Cruz DKK3 antibodies. Sections were incubated with secondary antibodies for 50\u2009min at RT, treated with 3,30-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with haematoxylin. Images were acquired using a Digital Slide Scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics). Images were analysed using Volocity and data analysed in GraphPad Prism. For each staining, positive area was calculated and normalised to the total area for all slices processed. For immunofluorescence, after antigen retrieval sections were incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) 10% Goat serum (Sigma) blocking solution for 1\u2009h RT. Sections were incubated overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C with primary antibodies diluted in PBS. After washing, the sections were incubated with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor) diluted in PBS for 1\u2009h at RT. Confocal images were captured using a Leica SP8 microscope. Quantitative analysis of YAP and \u03b2-catenin staining in the tumour stroma was performed using Volocity software. Briefly, fibroblasts were identified using automated threshold based on S100A4 staining. The mean intensities of YAP and \u03b2-catenin were then measured. In addition to haematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson\u2019s trichrome staining, antibody description and working dilutions can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a02.Tissue microarraysThe following tissue microarrays were purchased from US Biomax, Inc: breast cancer (BR1504b), colon cancer (CO2083) and ovarian cancer (OV2001a). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections were deparaffinized, blocked with 3% H2O2 and antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with Dako citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Slides were incubated with DKK3 antibody (DKK-3 H-130, Santa Cruz, sc-25518) for 1\u2009h at RT. Visualisation was achieved with 3,30-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen (Dako Envision\u2009+\u2009System). Images were acquired using a Digital Slide Scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics). DKK3 staining was quantified using the weighted Histoscore method to give a value of 0\u2013300.Tissue digestion for cell isolation and FACS analysisMMTV-PyMT tumours were minced with a scalpel and digested with a mixture of DNase and Liberase (Roche Diagnostics). On enzymatic digestion, samples were passed through a 100-\u03bcm filter. Cells were incubated for 5\u2009min at RT in 2\u2009mL NH4Cl solution (0.8% in H2O) to eliminate red blood cells. Cells were then directly used for FACS staining and sorted with a FACSAria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Single cell suspensions of tumour cells were labelled with FITC Rat Anti-Mouse CD45 Clone 30-F11 (BD Pharmingen\u2122, 553079), APC Rat Anti-Mouse CD31 Clone MEC 13.3 (BD Pharmingen\u2122, 561814), PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD326 (Ep-CAM) (BioLegend, 118215) and PE anti-mouse CD140a (PDGFRa) (BioLegend, 135905). For cell sorting, four populations (CD45+ for immune cells, CD31+ for endothelial, EPCAM+ for epithelial and PDGFRA+ for CAFs) were collected and processed for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR.Proliferation analysisFor proliferation analyses with conditioned media, TS1 cancer cells were seeded at 5,000 per well in a 24-well plate in duplicates and incubated with media containing 5% FBS (vehicle) or 5% FBS plus 100\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 recombinant DKK3 (rDKK3), or with CAF conditioned medium (5% FBS) for 72\u2009h. Where indicated, blocking antibody for DKK3 (R&D AF1118) or isotype control (R&D AB-108-C) were added at 1\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121. AlamarBlue\u00ae assay was used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions to compare cell growth and viability.Scratch Wound healing assayTS1 cancer cells were cultured to a confluent monolayer in 24-well plates. A straight scratch was made on the cell layer using a 200\u2009\u00b5L tip across the centre of the well. Cell debris was removed by washing twice with PBS and cells were incubated with media containing 5% FBS (vehicle) or 5% FBS plus 100\u2009ng\u2009mL\u22121 recombinant DKK3 (rDKK3), or with CAF conditioned medium (5% FBS). Where indicated, blocking antibody for DKK3 (R&D AF1118) or isotype control (R&D AB-108-C) were added at 1\u2009\u00b5g\u2009mL\u22121. Cell migration was monitored for 40\u2009h using live cell imaging in the IncuCyte\u00ae (Essen Bioscience) in a standard humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The wounded area at start and end of experiment was measured using ImageJ. Wound closure was calculated as the percentage of healed area (area at t0 minus area at t40) to the starting wounded area.Co-ImmunoprecipitationFor Kremen1 and DKK3 co-inmunoprecipitations, CAFs expressing empty vector of Flag-DKK3 were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50\u2009mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 10% glycerol, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 25\u2009mM NaF and 2\u2009mM NaH2PO4) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor. Lysates were pre-cleared using G-sepharose, incubated with anti-Flag antibody (rabbit) or IgG immobilised on G-sepharose beads at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Beads were then washed five times with lysis buffer and eluted with 20\u2009\u03bcL of 2x SDS sample buffer.Western blottingProtein lysates and immunoprecipitants were processed following standard procedures. Enhanced-chemiluminescence signal was acquired using an Azure Biosystems c600. Exposures within the dynamic range were quantified by densitometry using ImageJ. Antibody description and working dilutions can be found in Supplementary Table\u00a02. Immunoblot images in Figures and Supplementary Figures show molecular weight markers in kDa. Supplementary Figure\u00a09 shows the uncropped images corresponding to the panels displayed in the main figures.Luciferase reporter assaysThe following plasmids were used for luciferase reporter assays: TEAD\u2010reporter construct (8xGTIIC-luciferase, Addgene, Plasmid #34615), TOP\u2010reporter construct (M50 Super 8x TOPFlash, Addgene, Plasmid #12456) and CMV-Renilla (pGL4.75[hRluc/CMV], Promega). CAFs were seeded in 6-wells plates at 70% confluency. Cells were transfected with 2\u2009\u00b5g TOPFlash or TEAD\u2010reporter and 100\u2009ng of CMV-Renilla cDNA constructs using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cells were lysed 48\u2009h after transfection in 100\u2009\u03bcL of lysis buffer (Promega). Aliquots of the cell lysates were used to read luciferase emission using Dual-Glo\u00ae Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Luciferase activities were normalised to Renilla activity.Generation of syngeneic orthotopic tumoursMMTV-PyMT TS1 murine breast cancer cells were used to generate tumours in wild-type FVB/n. Briefly, 106 TS1 cells and 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CAF (WT, KO.9 or KO.9-REC) were suspended in 100\u2009\u03bcL of PBS:Matrigel (50:50) and injected subcutaneously into 6\u20138 week old females. Tumour size was measured every other day using callipers. To calculate tumour volume the formula V\u2009=\u2009(length\u2009\u00d7\u2009width2)\u2009/\u20092 was used. Mice were killed once tumours reach the maximum allowed size.Intravital imagingThe implantation of an orthotopic mammary imaging window in CD-1 nude mice was performed as previously described. Forty-eight hours after surgical implantation of the imaging window, a mixture of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 CAFs (GFP) and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 TS1 (CAAX-mCherry) cancer cells in a PBS:Matrigel solution (50:50) were injected under the window. Intravital 2-photon imaging was performed at specified time-points using a Leica SP8 microscope. Briefly, mice were anaesthetised and tumours were excited with an 880\u2009nm pulsed Ti\u2013Sapphire laser and emitted light acquired at 440\u2009nm (collagen second-harmonic generation, SHG) and 530\u2009nm (GFP). In addition, a mCherry signal was acquired sequentially using confocal microscopy. During ~10-min intervals, 5 to 8 different regions were imaged simultaneously for 2\u2009h for each tumour. In each region, a z-stack of 4\u20135 images (approximately 50\u2009\u00b5m deep on average) was taken at a spacing of 10\u2009\u03bcm between images, resulting in a time-lapse three-dimensional z-series for analysis. To analyse the collagen content, mean intensity of SHG signal of the top confocal plane for each z-stack was used. Moving cells were defined as those that moved 10\u2009\u03bcm or more during the length of each movie.RNA isolation and qRT-PCRTo obtain RNA from the different fibroblast populations, RNA was isolated using EZNA Total RNA Kit 1 (Omega Bio-tek). Reverse transcription was performed using Precision NanoScript 2 Reverse-Transcription-kit (PrimerDesign) and qPCR using PrecisionPLUS 2x qPCR MasterMix with ROX and SybrGreen (PrimerDesign). Expression levels of indicated genes were normalised to the expression of Gapdh, Rplp1 or Lamc2. Sequences of the oligonucleotides used for qRT-PCR are described in the Supplementary Table\u00a05. For array analysis, RNA was isolated as described and processed in collaboration with Eurofins Genomics (GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST Array\u2014details available on reasonable request).ChIP-qPCR7\u201310\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 NF or CAF at subconfluency were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and sonicated using the Bioruptor Pico sonication device (Diagenode; B01060001) using 15 cycles (30\u2009s on; 30\u2009s off) at maximum intensity. Purified chromatin was then separated for: (i) immunoprecipitation using Dynabeads Protein G (Life Technologies: 10003D) coated with 8\u2009\u00b5g and 4\u2009\u00b5g of HSF1 antibody (ThermoFisher: RT-405-P, and Cell Signalling: 4356\u2009S, respectively) per ChIP experiment; (ii) non-immunoprecipitated chromatin, used as Input control; and (iii) assessment of sonication efficiencies using a 1% agarose gel. For the quantitative PCR briefly, reactions were carried out in 10\u2009\u03bcL volume containing 5\u2009\u03bcL of Sybergreen mix (Applied Biosystems; 4472918), 0.5\u2009\u03bcL of primer (5\u2009\u03bcM final concentration), 2.5\u2009\u03bcL of genomic DNA and 2\u2009\u03bcL of DNAse/RNAse-free water. A three-step cycle programme and a melting analysis were applied. The cycling steps were as follows: 10\u2009s at 95\u2009\u00b0C, 30\u2009s at 60\u2009\u00b0C and 30\u2009s at 72\u2009\u00b0C, for 40 cycles. Enrichment of the immunoprecipitated sample was confirmed using positive and negative controls. The exact loci of the primers are as follows: negative control (gene desert): chr6:116908976\u2013116909177; Dkk3 Promoter (P): chr7:112159485\u2013112159638; Dkk3 Enhancer (E): chr7:112183116\u2013112183344; Rilpl, within the gene (positive control): chr5:124510011\u2013124510190.Gene expression analyses of clinical datasetsGene expression analyses of human tumour stroma were retrieved from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Datasets are described in Supplementary Figure\u00a01a and include: Finak (GSE9014, Breast), Karnoub (GSE8977, Breast), Yeoung (GSE40595, Ovary), Nishida (GSE35602, Colon), Saadi (GSE19632, Aesophagus), Costea (GSE38517, Oral SCC), Navab (GSE22863, Lung) and Sherman (GSE43770, Pancreas). Additional datasets include: GSE14548 (Breast cancer epithelia and stroma), GSE20086 (human breast NF and CAFs), GSE70468 (human colon NF and CAFs) and GSE35250 (human ovarian NF and CAFs). In addition, the dataset describing the expression profiles of cell populations purified from human colorectal cancer (GSE39396) was also used. For Affimetrix-based arrays, probe-to-gene mapping was performed using Jetset; for the rest of the arrays, highest variance probes were selected. Probes mapping DKK genes used for each array can be found in Supplementary Figure\u00a01a. Unless otherwise stated, expression values for each gene were z-score normalised. For the analyses of YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin signatures in tumour stromal datasets, we first generated CAF-specific YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin signatures. Genes significantly downregulated in murine CAF1 after transfection with YAP/TAZ siRNA or XAV939 (\u03b2-catenin inhibitor) treatment were identified. In addition, we sought for genes specifically expressed by FAP-positive CAFs in human tumours using the GSE39396 dataset. This dataset describes the expression profiles of cancer cells, immune cells, endothelial cells and CAFs purified from human colorectal cancer. We identified genes significantly upregulated more than 1.5-fold in FAP-positive samples when compared to the rest of the samples. Genes from the YAP/TAZ and \u03b2-catenin signatures that overlapped with the genes in the FAP-positive signature were selected into CAF-specific signatures; the rest were selected into CAF-unspecific signatures. To calculate the gene-signature score in each sample, we used single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) Projection Software from the GenePattern platform developed by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (USA) and available at GenePattern (www.genepattern.broadinstitute.org), following the programs guidelines (log normalisation; weighting exponent 0.75). This analysis calculates separate enrichment scores for each pairing of sample and gene set. Each ssGSEA enrichment score represents the degree to which the genes in a particular gene set are co-ordinately up- or downregulated within a sample. ssGSEA scores were z-score normalised. For analyses of HSF1 signature, a similar approach was performed. The top 200 genes downregulated between wild-type and Hsf1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (GSE56252) were identified and genes also present in the FAP-positive signature were selected to generate the HSF1 CAF-specific signature.Enrich database analysisTo identify putative transcription factors (TFs) regulating DKK3 expression we used the Enrich database [http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/]. We queried for DKK3 gene and retrieved the ChEA 2016 dataset to identify possible TFs that bind the DKK3 promoter, obtaining a list of 58 TFs (Supplementary Data\u00a01). In addition, we retrieved the TF-LOF Expression from GEO dataset to obtain a list of TFs whose loss of function has been associated to changes in DKK3 expression (Supplementary Table\u00a06).Survival analysesAnalysis of clinical relevance of DKK3 expression was assessed using publicly available data from the Kaplan\u2013Meir Plotter platform for breast and ovarian cancer (version 2014 and 2015, respectively), as well as the GSE17538 dataset for colorectal cancer. Probe-to-gene mapping was performed using Jetset. For survival analysis of ovarian cancer (progression-free survival), the highest quartile of gene expression was used to dichotomise the different tumours into high and low groups. Survival analyses for breast (recurrence-free survival) and colon (disease-specific survival) datasets, tumours were split into high and low based on median expression, respectively. For breast cancer, further analyses of recurrence-free survival and distant-metastasis-free survival were performed based on ER-status and molecular subtype. Breast cancer disease-free survival analysis based on DKK3 expression in the tumour microenvironment was performed using the Finak Dataset. Only ER-negative patients were analysed. Mean DKK3 expression was used to split tumours into high and low expression groups.Gene-set enrichment analyses (GSEA)Array data were processed and analysed using the Gene-set enrichment analysis software, developed by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (USA) and available at www.broadinstitute.org, following the programme guidelines. The specific settings applied in all analyses are: Number of Permutations (1000), Permutation Type (Gene set), Enrichment statistic (Weighted), and Metric for ranking genes (t Test). Values represent the False Discovery Rate (-log2) and the Nominal Enrichment Score (NES) of each gene set. The list of the specific gene sets analysed and their sources are available in Supplementary Data\u00a02.Statistical analysesStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). When n permitted, values were tested for Gaussian distribution using the D\u2019Agostino-Pearson normality test. For Gaussian distributions, paired or unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test and one-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test (for multiple comparisons) were performed. For non-Gaussian distributions, Mann\u2013Whitney\u2019s test and Kruskal\u2013Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s post-test (for multiple comparisons) were performed. Unless stated otherwise, mean values and standard errors (SEM) are shown. Survival curves were estimated based on the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared using a log-rank test. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Where indicated, individual p values are shown; alternatively the following symbols were used to describe statistical significance: *P\u2009<\u20090.05; **P\u2009<\u20090.01; ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; #P\u2009<\u20090.0001; n.s., non-significant.Reporting SummaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the\u00a0Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary informationJournal Peer Review Information: Nature Communications thanks the anonymous reviewers for their contributions to the peer review of this work.

This metabolic phenomenon is known as the \u2018Warburg effect\u2019. Although aerobic glycolysis is a more inefficient process compared to oxidative phosphorylation, cancer cells compensate for this by increasing their rate of glucose flux. The increased aerobic glycolysis results in accumulation of lactate both inside and outside of the tumor cells, i.e., in the extracellular tumor microenvironment. In addition, stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment can also contribute to the accumulation of lactate and thereby exposing tumor cells to a high lactate concentrations. Clinically, the lactate concentration in tumors has been estimated to be as high as 40 mM compared to the physiologic normal range of 0.5\u20132 mM.Both \u03b2-catenin-dependent and \u03b2-catenin-independent WNT signaling have been implicated as mediators of cancer cell metabolism. In breast cancer cells, \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling induces aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer via down-regulation of cytochrome c oxidase, thereby suppressing mitochondrial respiration. c-Myc, a transcriptional target of WNT \u03b2-catenin signaling, is known to upregulate key rate-limiting glycolytic genes, e.g., GLUT-1, LDH and PKM2, thereby stimulating aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. These findings are in accordance with the demonstrated role of \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling in the development and progression of breast cancer. In addition, there is direct and indirect evidence that suggests an essential role of \u03b2-catenin-independent WNT signaling in the regulation of cancer cell metabolism. The WNT5A ligand may accomplish its effect on cancer cell metabolism directly or by antagonizing \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling. The latter mechanism has been shown to be a part of its role as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer.WNT5A is a secreted glycoprotein that binds to specific receptor/co-receptor complexes to initiate intracellular signaling cascades that results in regulation of different cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Distinct expression of WNT5A has been reported in various cancers. In breast cancer, loss of WNT5A expression has been associated with early relapse and unfavorable prognosis. A similar tumor suppressive role of WNT5A has also been suggested in colon cancer and prostate cancer. In contrast, WNT5A has a tumor-promoting role in melanoma where it has been shown to escalate cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting melanoma metastasis. Recently, Sherwood et al. demonstrated that WNT5A can reprogram tumor cells and that these effects are diverse and context dependent. For example, in contrast to melanoma cells, WNT5A-treated breast cancer cells do not respond with an increase in aerobic glycolysis but instead with a significant increase in their oxygen consumption rate (OCR).Consequently, based on the previous report by Sherwood et al., we expanded the metabolic investigation of the consequences of WNT5A signaling in two metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) in the present study. We first transfected both breast cancer cell lines with a WNT5A plasmid to study the long-term effects of WNT5A signaling in an environment that mimics in vivo conditions. We also stimulated the breast cancer cells lines with recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A) and Foxy5, a WNT5A-mimic peptide that is presently in a clinical phase 1b study. Our present findings revealed the mechanisms whereby WNT5A signaling reduces lactate production and the uptake of lactate from the extracellular microenvironment, and they also demonstrated that the WNT5A-induced metabolic changes are essential for its ability to impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Due to the inhibition of breast cancer cell migration, even in the presence of extracellular lactate, the WNT5A-mimic peptide, Foxy5, is implicated as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of extremely glycolytic and aggressive breast cancers.RESULTSWNT5A signaling inhibits lactate production and cell migration without affecting cell proliferationPreviously, Sherwood et al. demonstrated that WNT5A signaling positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in melanomas, thereby making melanoma cells more migratory and invasive. In the same study, the authors\u2019 also demonstrated that rWNTA-treated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells show induced oxidative phosphorylation but no changes in lactate secretion. In the present study, we performed a more thorough investigation of the role of WNT5A signaling on aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells using several different approaches. Although rWNT5A clearly triggers WNT5A signaling in breast cancer cells, the stability of rWNT5A in cell culture conditions remains unknown. A potential variability in the concentration of rWNT5A might affect its regulation of aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, to address this problem, we transfected two metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) with a WNT5A plasmid as these cells have no endogenous WNT5A expression (Supplementary Figure 1). Both breast cancer cell lines expressing the WNT5A plasmid (MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) showed significant decreases in lactate production after 72 h compared to the respective empty vector (EV)-transfected control cells (Figure 1A and 1B). These findings clearly demonstrated that WNT5A signaling inhibits lactate production in breast cancer cells, which is in direct contrast to its effect in melanoma cells. Using the same experimental conditions, we investigated parallel effects on migration and proliferation of the breast cancer cells via Transwell migration and MTT assays. Compared to their respective controls (EV), migration was significantly decreased in WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells (Figure 1C and 1D). Morphologically, WNT5A expressing breast cancer cells exhibited less migration relevant membrane protrusions, as compared to control EV transfected cells (Supplementary Figure 2). WNT5A signaling did not affect breast cancer cell growth (Figure 1E and 1F). These experiments suggested a potential relation between lactate secretion and cell migration in breast cancer cells.WNT5A signaling inhibits lactate production and cell migration but not cell proliferation in breast cancer cellsCell culture media lactate measurements for the (A) MDA-MB-468-5A and (B) MDA-MB-231-5A WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells compared to empty vector-expressing cells at 72 h.

PFK is a complex tetrameric enzyme that exists in three isoforms as follows: liver (PFKL), muscle (PFKM), and platelet (PFKP). To explore the relevance of these PFK isoforms in breast cancer, we investigated how their respective expression related to breast cancer patient survival by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Using online meta-analysis software, gene expression profiles of PFKP, PFKL and PFKM derived from GEO (Affymetrix microarrays only), EGA and TCGA data sets were generated using 1117 breast tumor samples as described by Gyorffy et al.. Of the three PFK isoforms, the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses showed that high PFKP expression correlated with decreased patient survival (HR = 2.01; p = 0.00083), whereas the two other PFK isoforms (PFKL and PFKM) did not (Figure 2A\u20132C). Overall, these results indicate that the expression of PFKP not only relates to the glycolytic activity but also to breast cancer patient prognosis.Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis of PFKP, PKFL, and PKFM in breast cancer patientsKaplan-Meir survival analysis of (A) PFKP, (B) PKFL, and (C) PKFM mRNA in 1117 breast cancer patients with Kaplan-Meier Plotter.

These results made us investigate if these findings occurred simultaneously with a WNT5A-induced altered protein expression of not only PFKP but also of two additional key glycolytic proteins, Hexokinase II (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), in breast cancer cells. We have in the present study focused our interest on the potential roles of enzymes that are designated as critical regulators of glycolysis. However, it is important to underline that this does not exclude contribution of other enzymes in the regulation of lactate production. Using Western blotting, we investigated the expression of HK, PK and PFKP in MDAMB-468-5A cells, as these glycolytic enzymes are crucially involved in the production of lactate and play essential roles in breast cancer progression. Of these three enzymes, only the expression of PFKP was decreased in MDA-MB-468-5A cells as compared to control MDA-MB-468-EV cells (Figure 3A). WNT5A expression significantly reduced PFKP expression in both breast cancer cell lines (i.e., MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) compared to their respective EV-transfected control cells (Figure 3B and 3C). The down-regulation of PFKP, a key glycolytic enzyme, by WNT5A signaling correlates with the ability of WNT5A to decrease lactate secretion in breast cancer cells.WNT5A signaling inhibits PFKP expression in breast cancer cells(A) Representative Western blot showing changes in key glycolytic markers in the MDA-MB-468-5A WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells compared to empty vector-expressing cells (MDA-MB-468-EV).

For siRNA efficiency and specificity experiments, we transiently transfected parental MDA-MB-231 cells with 25, 50 or 100 nM PFKP siRNA for 48 h and analyzed the effects on PFKP expression by Western blotting (Supplementary Figure 3). Of the three concentrations tested, we selected 25 nM for the subsequent experiments. We next examined if PFKP silencing affected lactate production in parental breast cancer cell lines. Both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with 25 nM PFKP siRNA, and lactate production was then analyzed after 72 h. Significant reductions in lactate production were observed in both PFKP-silenced breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) as compared to their respective control cells (NC) (Figure 4A and 4B). These results support the notion that the WNT5A-mediated decrease in lactate production in breast cancer cells is due to the WNT5A-induced reduced expression of PFKP protein. To investigate the functional role of PFKP in breast cancer cells, we next investigated how the reduced expression of PFKP affects breast cancer cell migration and invasion. PFKP-silenced MDA-MB-468 (Figure 4C) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4D) cells showed significantly impaired migration compared to their respective controls. For the invasion experiments, we selected the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells over the less invasive MDA-MB-468 cells. In accordance with the migration results, PFKP siRNA treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in significant inhibition of their invading capacity compared to cells treated with negative control (NC) siRNA (Figure 4E). These results indicated that PFKP expression positively regulates not only lactate production but also breast cancer cell migration and invasion.PFKP knockdown inhibits lactate production and impairs breast cancer cell migration and invasionExtracellular lactate measurements in (A) MDA-MB-468 and (B) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transiently transfected with PFKP siRNA compared to control NC siRNA as described in the Materials and Methods section.

We examined the role of \u03b2-catenin signaling for the following two reasons: 1) active \u03b2-catenin signaling positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in cancers, including breast tumors; and 2) WNT5A expression inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in breast cancer cells, and ERK1/2 signaling has been suggested to activate WNT \u03b2-catenin signaling. Hence, we analyzed the expression of active (non-phosphorylated) \u03b2-catenin in the two WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cell lines. Significant reductions in the expression of active \u03b2-catenin were observed in the cell lysates of both WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cell lines (Figure 5A and 5B) as compared to their respective control EV cells. Moreover, significant inhibition of LEF/TCF reporter activity was found in MDA-MB-468-5A cells compared to MDA-MB-468-EV cells (Figure 5C), thereby indicating that WNT5A signaling impairs \u03b2-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells. To investigate if the WNT5A-mediated inhibition of \u03b2-catenin is mediated through altered ERK1/2 signaling, we next treated the breast cancer cell lines with U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of both MEK1 and MEK2 resulting in impaired ERK signaling (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B). Exposure to U0126 for 24 h reduced active \u03b2-catenin protein expression in parental MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B), demonstrating that \u03b2-catenin is a downstream target of ERK1/2 suggesting that WNT5A-induced inhibition of ERK1/2 activity is a possible cause of its inhibitory effect on \u03b2-catenin in these cells. Alternatively, U0126 might alter the level of P-LRP6 in WNT5A expressing cells and thereby regulate \u03b2-catenin signaling.WNT5A signaling inhibits \u03b2-catenin expression in breast cancer cells(A) Representative Western blots and quantification of non-phospho (Active) \u03b2-catenin protein in MDA MB-468-5A cells compared to MDA-MB-468-EV cells.

For the experiments, we used XAV939, a potent tankyrase (TNKS) inhibitor that antagonizes \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling via stimulation of \u03b2-catenin degradation and stabilization of axin. Treatment of MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells for 24 h with XAV939 (10 \u03bcM) resulted in a significant decrease in lactate production as compared to vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells (Supplementary Figure 4C and 4D), demonstrating that \u03b2-catenin signaling positively regulates aerobic glycolysis in these breast cancer cells.We next tested if direct inhibition of \u03b2-catenin signaling in breast cancer cells will result in decreased PFKP protein expression. We treated parental MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells with rWNT5A and XAV939 independently and analyzed PFKP expression by Western blotting. Treatment with either rWNT5A or XAV939 resulted in significant decreases in the expression of active \u03b2-catenin and PFKP in MDA-MB-468 (Figure 6A) and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6B) cells. These data suggested that \u03b2-catenin positively regulates PFKP expression and thereby aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells.Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin results in reduced expression of PFKP in breast cancer cellsParental breast cancer cells were treated with recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A; 0.4 \u03bcg/ml) and XAV939 (\u03b2-catenin inhibitor; 10 \u03bcM) for 16 h.

However, in cancer tissue, lactate is not only generated from cancer cells but also from stromal cells in the cancer microenvironment. The presence of stromal-derived lactate in the tumor microenvironment can be imported into cancer cells through the specific lactate transporter, monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), and can consequently also regulate migration and invasion of such cancer cells. To study the effects of extracellular lactate on breast cancer cell migration in the absence and presence of WNT5A signaling, we treated breast cancer cells with sodium L-lactate (10 mM) under different conditions and evaluated their migratory responses. A significant increase in migration was found for lactate-treated MDA-MB-468-EV cells as compared to vehicle (water)-treated EV cells (Figure 7A). However, WNT5A-expressing MDA-MB-468 cells did not respond to extracellular lactate treatment, suggesting that WNT5A signaling abolishes the response of breast cancer cells towards extracellular lactate. In search of an underlying mechanism, we next investigated if WNT5A signaling affects the expression of the MCT1 lactate transporter in these cells. We found decreased expression of MCT1 in both MDA-MB-231-5A and MDA-MB-468-5A cells in comparison with their respective empty vector transfected control cells (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure 5). As the endogenous expression of MCT1 was very low in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 5) we performed the subsequent experiments in MDA-MB-468 cells. We therefore validated the decreased expression levels of MCT1 in MDA-MB-468-WNT5A cells compared to MDA-MB-468-EV cells and these results suggest that WNT5A signaling inhibits MCT1 expression (Figure 7B). Furthermore, even in the presence of lactate, breast cancer cells expressing WNT5A showed a statistically significant reduced level of MCT1 as compared to lactate treated MDA-MB-468-EV cells (p = 0.006) (Figure 7B).Lactate-induced migration of breast cancer cells is impaired in the presence of WNT5A signaling in MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with WNT5A(A) WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468-5A) and empty vector (MDA-MB-468-EV) cells were treated with 10 mM lactate or vehicle (water) for 48 h and then subjected to transwell migration analysis for the next 24 h. The experiments with WNT5A transfected breast cancer cells were performed for 72 h (end point) to allow sufficient time for secretion of WNT5A.

In accordance with our previous results (Figure 7), addition of exogenous lactate induced increased migration of both MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 parental breast cancer cells, and addition of either rWNT5A (Figure 8A and 8B) or Foxy5 (Figure 8C and 8D) caused a strong inhibition of migratory responses even in the presence of lactate in both cell lines.Lactate-induced migration of breast cancer cells impaired in MDA-MB-468 cells stimulated with rWNT5A or Foxy5(A) MDA-MB-468 and (B) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with 10 mM lactate in the presence or absence of rWNT5A (0.4 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 h and then subjected to transwell migration analysis for the next 24 h.

(C) MDA-MB-468 and (D) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with 10 mM lactate in the presence or absence of Foxy5 (100 \u03bcM) for 24 h and then subjected to transwell migration analysis for the next 24 h. These experiments were performed with parental breast cancer cell lines treated with lactate in the absence or presence of exogenously added recombinant WNT5A (0.4 \u03bcg/ml) or Foxy5 (100 \u03bcM). These experiments were performed for 48 h (endpoint) since we did not have to include time for secretion of WNT5A. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n = 4). *p < 0.05, **p = 0.01, ***p = 0.001.DISCUSSIONCancer cells favor aerobic glycolysis as they can adjust themselves to fluctuating O2 tensions, while other cells that rely on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP might perish under such conditions. In human breast cancer, the activity of glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, is many fold higher compared to normal tissues. In the current study, we investigated the role of WNT5A signaling in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer. Unlike melanomas in which WNT5A triggers tumor-promoting effects including a positive regulation of aerobic glycolysis, we expected an opposing effect in breast cancer cells where WNT5A is predominantly considered to exert tumor suppressor functions. The breast cancer cell lines used in the present study (MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231) both lack endogenous expression of WNT5A protein, making them ideal to study the effects of WNT5A signaling via either transfection with a WNT5A plasmid or direct stimulation with rWNT5A or Foxy5, a WNT5A-mimic peptide. Our results demonstrated that WNT5A signaling causes a reduced production of lactate in breast cancer cells in parallel with reduced cellular migration and down-regulation of PFKP. Our investigation also revealed that other isoforms of phosphofructokinase, i.e., PFKL and PFKM, do not play important roles in promoting breast cancer progression as only high PFKP gene expression is associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients. Using a siRNA knockdown approach, we demonstrated that PFKP plays a crucial role in regulating aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that PFKP-silenced breast cancer cells exhibited reduced lactate production as well as impaired breast cancer cell migration and invasion. In support of our findings, Park et al. demonstrated that the Tat-activating regulatory DNA-binding protein (TARDBP) regulates aerobic glycolysis by regulating PFKP through miR-520, suggesting that PFKP is indeed a key molecule in altering glucose metabolism. Recent studies in which PFKP expression was indirectly increase or decrease either via the ZBTB7A transcriptional repressor or by sorafenib have suggested that PFKP might be a suitable drug target for anti-cancer therapies as inhibition of PFKP represses aerobic glycolysis.The question then arises via what pathway WNT5A decreases the expression of PFKP and thus glycolysis. Based on the findings that WNT5A can reduce \u03b2-catenin activity in colon cancer cells and that \u03b2-catenin signaling induces aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells, we explored the possibility that WNT5A impairs aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells via impaired \u03b2-catenin signaling. For these experiments, we used an anti-active-\u03b2-catenin antibody and found that WNT5A signaling significantly reduced the amount of active-\u03b2-catenin protein in breast cancer cells. The data was further validated by demonstrating reduced LEF/TCF reporter activity in WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells, proposing that WNT5A not only suppresses \u03b2-catenin protein expression but also inhibits its downstream transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells. The present observation that the inhibitor of \u03b2-catenin signaling, XAV939, impairs not only the amount of active \u03b2-catenin but also the expression of PFKP in a manner similar to that of WNT5A signaling supports the idea that WNT5A impairs aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells via reduced \u03b2-catenin signaling. Further support of this comes from the findings that XAV939 impairs both \u03b2-catenin signaling and PFKP expression more efficiently than WNT5A signaling. In support of our results and conclusions, Pate et al. recently demonstrated that XAV939 treatment of colon cancer cells reduces their glucose consumption and lactate production in parallel with a 30\u201340% increase in their oxidative phosphorylation rate.Cancer cells are not the only source of lactate in breast tumor tissue as stromal fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment can also secrete lactate. By culturing mammary stromal cells (RMF-621) in high glucose conditions, Tobar et al. recently demonstrated a metabolic response characterized by induced lactate production in these cells that in turn fuels mammary epithelial growth with significant increase in cell migration and invasion. In accordance with our present results, these authors also showed that lactate treatment alone significantly upregulates the transwell invasion of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Similarly, Bonuccelli et al. demonstrated that L-lactate stimulates MDA-MB-231 cells from metastatic lung lesions compared to control cells, suggesting that lactate drives the metastatic spread of breast cancer cells. As we have shown previously that WNT5A signaling inhibits endogenous migration of breast cancer cells, we next investigated if active WNT5A signaling in breast cancer cells can counteract the effect of extracellular lactate. In the present study, we demonstrated that increased migration induced by extracellular lactate was impaired in WNT5A-transfected breast cancer cells, thereby suggesting that WNT5A might inhibit lactate uptake in breast cancer cells. Our finding that WNT5A signaling inhibits the expression of the key lactate importer, MCT1, suggests a mechanism whereby WNT5A counteracts the effect of extracellular lactate in breast cancer cells and thereby their ability to migrate and disseminate to form metastatic lesions. In support of our present finding that WNT5A impairs the expression of MCT1, inhibition of MCT1 has been shown to impair lactate transport as well as migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. On the basis of our results, we have provided a schematic diagram on how WNT5A signaling regulates aerobic glycolysis and thereby cell migration in breast cancer cells (Figure 9). Finally, our results demonstrating that both rWNT5A and Foxy5 continue to inhibit breast cancer cell migration, even in the presence of extracellular lactate, lends further support for the idea of therapeutically using Foxy5 to impair metastatic spread in the treatment of extremely glycolytic and aggressive breast cancers.Schematic diagram of WNT5A signaling regulation of aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cellsThe present study favors the idea that WNT5A signaling via a \u03b2-catenin-PFKP axis reduces lactate production and decreases the expression of MCT1 (a lactate uptake carrier) in breast cancer cells thereby adding to the ability of WNT5A to impair migration and invasion.Overall, we showed that WNT5A signaling not only inhibits lactate production but also impairs lactate import, thereby inhibiting cell migration. Our study also highlighted the importance of WNT5A, \u03b2-catenin, PFKP and MCT1 in lactate regulation in breast cancer cells, thereby providing a therapeutic window where agonists (such as Foxy5) and antagonists of these molecules can be utilized for breast cancer therapy either alone or in combination.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell linesThe MDA-MB-468 (Lot No. 58483213) and MDA-MB-231 (Lot No. 58629943) human mammary carcinoma cell lines were procured directly from the American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were grown in DMEM (HyClone, Utah, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 U/ml penicillin, 0.5 U/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine. The cell lines were frequently screened for mycoplasma contamination using an EZ-PCR kit (HaEmek, Israel).Plasmid and siRNA transfectionsThe pcDNA3.1 (\u00b1)-WNT-5A plasmid or the pcDNA3.1 empty vector were used to transfect the MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells lines as described by Prasad et al.. The stable breast cancer cells expressing WNT-5A (i.e., MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 700 \u03bcg/mL geneticin (G418). Continued WNT-5A expression was verified by Western blot analysis performed on cell lysates and on conditioned cell culture media. Prior to the lactate assay, proliferation assay, migration/or invasion assay, LEF/TCF reporter assay, siRNA transfections and Western blot analysis, the cells were washed with PBS and grown for 48 h in G418-free DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS to condition the media with WNT-5A.For PFKP transient knockdown, sequence-specific siRNAs were used. The smart pool of PFKP siRNA (h) (Cat. no.sc-106401) was procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Texas, USA). The negative control (NC) scrambled sequence #1 siRNA was obtained from Applied Biosystems (CA, USA). Briefly, breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a transfection complex of 25 nM siRNA (final concentration) and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) suspended in serum-free DMEM. After 6 h, the transfection complex was removed, and the cells were replenished with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cells were then allowed to grow for the next 48 h prior to use for Western blot analysis, lactate assay, migration assay or invasion assay.Western blottingWNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells or parental breast cancer cells treated with PFKP siRNA, rWNT5A, XAV939, U0126 or not were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold phosphorylation lysis buffer (PLB). The protein estimation, SDS-PAGE and visualization procedures were performed as described in Prasad et al.. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-WNT5A from R&D systems (MN, USA); anti-Hexokinase-II, anti-Puruvate Kinase; anti-PKFP, anti-non-phospho (Active) \u03b2-catenin, and anti-pERK1/2 antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA); anti-MCT1 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (TX, USA); and anti-\u03b2-actin antibody from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-goat, which were procured from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Separated protein bands were visualized using Chemiluminescence HRP substrate (Millipore), and the membranes were imaged and analyzed using the Chemi Doc\u2122 imaging system from Bio-Rad.Kaplan-meier survival analysisThe Kaplan-Meier-Plotter online software was used to perform meta-analysis-based biomarker prediction as described by Gyorffy et al.. For our analysis, we plotted and calculated overall survival (OS) for breast cancer patients (n = 1117) with respect to expression of all the three isoforms of phosphofructokinase (PFKP, Platelet; PFKL, Liver; and PFKM, Muscle) and WNT5A.Lactate assaySecreted lactate in the cell culture supernatant (from WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells after siRNA PFKP or XAV939 treatment) was measured using the lactate estimation kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the experiments for lactate estimation were performed in low serum conditions.Cell proliferation assayBriefly, WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-231-5A) were seeded (5.0 \u00d7 104 cells/well) in 12 well plates and were allowed to grow for 72 h. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to assess cell proliferation. MTT solution (25 \u03bcl; 5 mg/ml) was added to each well 6 h prior to the end point. After 72 h, the medium was discarded and DMSO was added to the cells. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega).Transwell migration and invasion assayPFKP siRNA-transfected or L-lactate-treated breast cancer cells were washed and detached with Versene (Gibco\u00ae, NY, USA) and re-suspended as single-cell suspensions in low-serum DMEM (supplemented with 1% FBS). The cell invasion assays were performed in cell culture inserts (PET membrane with 8.0 \u03bcm pore size; Ref# 353097; Corning Incorporated, NC, USA). The cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess\u2122, Invitrogen). A total of 25,000 cells in low-serum DMEM was added to the upper chamber [for rWNT5A treatment, 0.4 \u03bcg/ml rWNT5A was added to the medium], and the lower chamber was filled with 0.7 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to invade for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells in the insert were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. The non-migratory cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton-tipped applicator and were further processed as published by Linnskog et al.. Transwell invasion assays for PFKP siRNA-treated MDA-MB-231 cells were performed in a similar manner using BD Matrigel\u2122 invasion chambers (MA, USA) in which 50,000 cells were added to the upper chamber. Statistical analyses were performed by taking those cells into account that have migrated or invaded to the other side of the membrane (outer side). Furthermore, it was checked that the incubation time (24 h) used in these experiments did not allow cells to detach from the membrane into the lower chamber.LEF/TCF reporter assayThe LEF/TCF reporter assay was used to determine \u03b2-catenin-dependent WNT signaling activity. A construct containing a promoter with TCF-binding motifs upstream of a Firefly luciferase gene was transfected into the MDA-MB-468-5A and MDA-MB-468-EV cells. \u03b2-catenin binding to the TCF motif resulted in the transcription and translation of luciferase and in the emission of a bioluminescence signal. To normalize for transfection efficiency, a CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporter was co-transfected. The luciferase substrates were purchased from Promega (Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter (DLR) Assay, E1910) and automatically added by a dual-injector system according to manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity of cell extracts was measured using a Mini Lumat LB 9506 (Berthold Technologies).ImmunofluorescenceBreast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468-EV & MDA-MB-5A) were grown on 13-mm glass cover-slips for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After incubation, cells were washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 3 min, all at room temperature. Next, cells were incubated with Phalloidin-TRITC (1:400; Sigma Aldrich) for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, the cells were rinsed with PBS and counter-stained with DAPI (300 nM in PBS) for 2 min. For Confocal imaging (Carl Zeiss LSM 700), the fixed and stained cells were mounted with the Dako Fluorescent Mounting Medium and viewed with a 40\u00d7 objective.Statistical analysisAll the data presented herein are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error. Each of the experiments was repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis was throughout performed using two-tailed Student's t-test and p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For the lactate production experiments we used unpaired t-test and for the migration and invasion assays we used paired t-test. All of the statistical tests and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (CA, USA).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTTommy Andersson is a shareholder of WNT Research and is the parttime Chief Scientific Officer of WNT Research, but this does not alter the authors\u2019 adherence to all of the policies on sharing data and materials as stated in the guidelines for publication in Oncotarget.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) comprise a heterogeneous population of stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment. CAFs exhibit both tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions, making them exciting targets for improving cancer treatments. Careful isolation, identification, and characterisation of CAF heterogeneity is thus necessary for ex vivo validation and future implementation of CAF-targeted strategies in cancer. Murine 4T1 (metastatic) and 4T07 (poorly/non-metastatic) orthotopic triple negative breast cancer tumours were collected after 7, 14, or 21\u2009days. The tumours were analysed via flow cytometry for the simultaneous expression of six CAF markers: alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta (PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2), CD26/DPP4 and podoplanin (PDPN). All non-CAFs were excluded from the analysis using a lineage marker cocktail (CD24, CD31, CD45, CD49f, EpCAM, LYVE-1, and TER-119). In total 128 murine tumours and 12 healthy mammary fat pads were analysed. We have developed a multicolour flow cytometry strategy based on exclusion of non-CAFs and successfully employed this to explore the temporal heterogeneity of freshly isolated CAFs in the 4T1 and 4T07 mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer. Analysing 128 murine tumours, we identified 5-6 main CAF populations and numerous minor ones based on the analysis of \u03b1SMA, FAP\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, CD26, and PDPN. All markers showed temporal changes with a distinct switch from primarily PDGFR\u03b1+ fibroblasts in healthy mammary tissue to predominantly PDGFR\u03b2+ CAFs in tumours. CD26+ CAFs emerged as a large novel subpopulation, only matched by FAP\u03b1+ CAFs in abundance. We demonstrate that multiple subpopulations of CAFs co-exist in murine triple negative breast cancer, and that the abundance and dynamics for each marker differ depending on tumour type and time. Our results form the foundation needed to isolate and characterise specific CAF populations, and ultimately provide an opportunity to therapeutically target specific CAF subpopulations.",

        "content": "Within the tumour stroma, a heterogeneous population of cell types reciprocally regulates cell proliferation, which considerably affects the progression of the disease. In this study, using tumour conditioned medium (TCM) derived from breast tumour cell lines - MCF7 and MDA MB 231, we have demonstrated the differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) into tumour-associated fibroblasts (TAFs). Since the Wnt signalling pathway is a key signalling pathway driving breast tumour growth, the effect of the Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) was also examined. The response of ADSCs to TCM and sFRP4 treatments was determined by using cell viability assay to determine the changes in ADSC viability, immunofluorescence for mesenchymal markers, glucose uptake assay, and glycolysis stress test using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux analyser to determine the glycolytic activity of ADSCs. ADSCs have been shown to acquire a hyper-proliferative state, significantly increasing their number upon short-term and long-term exposure to TCM. Changes have also been observed in the expression of key mesenchymal markers as well as in the metabolic state of ADSCs. SFRP4 significantly inhibited the differentiation of ADSCs into TAFs by reducing cell growth as well as mesenchymal marker expression (cell line-dependent). However, sFRP4 did not induce further significant changes to the altered metabolic phenotype of ADSCs following TCM exposure. Altogether, this study suggests that the breast tumour milieu may transform ADSCs into a tumour-supportive phenotype, which can be altered by Wnt antagonism, but is independent of metabolic changes.",

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a special molecular subtype that is characteristic of negative hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Neither endocrine therapy nor routine targeted therapy is effective for TNBC. There are limited therapeutic selections for TNBC and some patients are still burdened by low efficacy of treatment response and high risk of recurrence or metastasis. Hence, it is crucial to explore the mechanism underlying TNBC development and progression, which may lay a foundation for its diagnosis and treatment.The crucial role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which serves as the soil for seeds (cancer cells), has been proven in many studies. Cells in the TME mainly include stromal cells and immune cells. Recently, increasing evidence has highlighted that appropriate stromal cells are crucial for the development of tumors. Among them, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the main fraction, and accumulating evidence has indicated their role in cancer proliferation, progression and invasion. It is well acknowledged that CAFs interact with malignant cells and orchestrate the metastasis of breast cancer. Although various clinical trials targeting CAFs have been performed in recent years, such as targeting surface markers, reducing CAF infiltration and normalizing CAF functions, most of them are still ongoing. Previous studies have identified many CAF markers, but few of them have moved into clinical practice. This may be due to the internal heterogeneity of CAFs. The CAFs seemed to originate from diverse cell types, such as fibrocytes, stellate cells, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells. It is well accepted that most activated fibroblasts are derived from fibroblasts of adjacent normal tissues and induced by oxidative stress or specific cytokines and chemokines from cancer cells. Hence, distinct subclusters have been identified by previous studies. CAFs in human breast cancer can be divided into CAF-S1 to CAF-S4 according to specific signatures, such as CD29, FAP, FSP1, \u03b1-SMA, CAV1 and DPP4. Furthermore, the CAF-S1 cluster contributes to a poor response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy has become a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment in recent years. Therefore, focusing on the function and mechanism of fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment may provide a strategy for breast cancer treatment, especially immunotherapy.In this study, we explored the relative infiltration level of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer and the correlation between CAFs and immune components in the TME. We further identified an upregulated secreted protein, biglycan, in CAFs compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs) using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry methods. Biglycan is encoded by the BGN gene and is mainly expressed in the stromal part of tumors. Biglycan is a protein that belongs to the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family. We found that the expression level of BGN is correlated with the extracellular matrix, lymphangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Single-cell sequencing results show that BGN is mainly expressed in stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, BGN is highly expressed in CAFs of TNBC compared with other cell subpopulations. The role of BGN in the TME and its mechanism underlying how to affect the microenvironment remain unknown.Establishing the relevance of the role of fibroblasts and biglycan in human triple-negative breast cancer using publicly available datasets and clinical samples raises the probability that targeting biglycan may yield clinical utility.MethodsDatasets and tissue specimensThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was obtained using the TCGAbiolinks package in R software. The transcripts per million (TPM) value was estimated at the transcript level. Patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer histologically and available for transcriptomic data were included. To further distinguish triple-negative breast cancer samples from the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), patients with immunohistochemically negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were included. A total of 116 patients were enrolled in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using vital status and days from diagnosis to death or the last follow-up date. Only patients with active follow-up information were included in survival analysis.The processed data of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset were downloaded from cBioPortal (http://www.cbioportal.org/) according to the website\u2019s guidance. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer and available for active follow-up information were included. Triple-negative breast cancer samples were also enrolled in the METABRIC-TNBC cohort as described above.For other TNBC datasets (GSE25066, GSE103091, GSE21653 and GSE88715), the expression matrices were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The probes were mapped using the corresponding annotation platforms. The expression values were further normalized by the limma package if necessary. The secreted genes were predicted as previously reported. Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets were acquired and analyzed according to the guidance of previous studies. The cell types were annotated using the SingleR package if necessary. GSE114727, GSE136206, GSE138536 were used to observe the expression of CAF markers in single-cell level. The BGN expression was also analyzed in cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Wu SZ, et al.). These datasets are shown in Table S1. No identification information of participants was involved during download and analysis.Tissues for immunohistochemistry and primary cell isolation were obtained at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) between January 2010 and June 2021. The clinical breast cancer specimens were collected with permission from the Institutional Review Board of the SYSUCC and informed consent was obtained from participants. The study was conducted according to the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.Tumor microenvironment estimationThe Estimate the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells (EPIC), xCell, and Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) algorithms were applied to calculate the cancer-associated fibroblast scores in datasets. To analyze the correlation among fibroblasts and immune cells, fractions of 22 immune cells were estimated using the Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) algorithm. The estimation of stromal and immune cells in malignant tumor tissues using expression data (ESTIMATE) was applied to calculate the overall stromal and immune scores in cancer.Molecular markers and CAF clusteringRepresentative immune-related genes (IRGs) and CAF signatures were obtained from previous studies. The IFN-\u03b3 signature (IFNG1, STAT1, CXCL10, IDO1, CXCL9), myeloid lineage (CD14, CD163, ARG1, CD68, OLR1, NOS2, CD33), inhibitory immune ligands/receptors (HAVCR2, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1, CD274), immune modulators (ENTPD1, NT5E) and activating immune receptors (TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, CD40, CD80, CD27, ICOS) were analyzed as previously reported. The edgeR and limma packages were used to calculate the fold change of genes between groups.Several classic CAF markers were adopted from previous studies to estimate the relative abundance of fibroblasts in cancer samples, including PDGFRA, PDGFRB, ACTA2, THY1, PDPN, COL1A1 and FAP. Clustering was performed in individual datasets, and the samples were further classified into high-, medium-, and low-infiltration groups using the ComplexHeatmap package. To further confirm the clustering results, the principal components analysis (PCA) method was applied as previously desribed. Inflammatory and myofibroblastic CAF features were also included to assess the internal characteristics. Comparisons of biological markers among different CAF infiltration groups are shown by the ggheatmap and ComplexHeatmap packages.Functional analysisThe GSVA package was used for gene set variation analysis (GSVA). The GSVA results were compared between the high- and low-CAF infiltration groups and are displayed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological functions of BGN and performed using GSEA 4.1.0. Hallmark and gene ontology gene sets were obtained from the MSigDB Collections (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea). The TGF-\u03b2 response signatures (TBRS) of T cells (T-TBRS), fibroblasts (F-TBRS), endothelial cells (End-TBRS) and macrophages (Ma-TBRS) were calculated and compared between different CAF infiltration groups as previously reported.Primary cell culture, RNA sequencing and mass spectrometryPrimary fibroblasts were isolated from immunohistochemically confirmed breast cancer samples obtained from surgery. For normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts (NAFs), tissues >2 cm away from cancer were used. Primary fibroblasts were isolated as described in previous studies. Briefly, tissues were digested with hyaluronidase (Sigma), collagenase type I (Sigma) and collagenase type III (Worthinton) at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 3\u20134\u00a0hours. The digested tissues were then incubated without shaking for 10\u00a0min, and the supernatant enriched with stromal cells was moved to new tubes and centrifuged at 250\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was harvested and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fibroblasts were passaged within 5 population doublings after isolation. The RNA of the primary cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). More than 2\u00a0\u03bcg of high-quality RNA with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of 1.8\u20132.2 per sample was used for subsequent experiments. The rRNA-depleted RNA was prepared by the Ribo-off\u2122 rRNA depletion kit (Vazyme, N406-01) and further applied to synthesize the first cDNA using Total RNA-seq Library Prep Kit (Vazyme, NR603). After library construction, fragments were further enriched by PCR amplification (NEST Biotechnology) and screened before sequencing. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform was used for sequencing and raw reads were generated following the recommended protocol from the vendor. The transcripts per million (TPM) were calculated at the transcript level based on counts data.The culture medium of primary cells was collected and centrifuged at 500\u00a0g for 10\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C and 10,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was further filtered using a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm filter. Briefly, the protein was extracted, digested by trypsin and further applied for label-free mass spectrometry. The results were further searched in Maxquant software and quantified using LFQ method.ImmunohistochemistryThe samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The samples were then sectioned into 3\u00a0\u03bcm slides. Antigen retrieval was performed using a pressure cooker with citrate buffer (CWBIO) for 10\u201315\u00a0min. Goat serum (ZSGB-BIO) was used to block nonspecific binding to the samples. The samples were further incubated with specific anti-biglycan (1:150, Proteintech) or anti-CD8 (ready to use, ZSGB-BIO) antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight and a secondary antibody (ZSGB-BIO) at room temperature for 1 hour. The expression of protein was detected using DAB (Dako) following the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. The density of infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells was estimated using HALO software (Indica Labs).Western blotFor cell lines, cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) at 4\u00b0C directly. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Beyotime) was added to reduce protein degradation during extraction. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes, and nonfat milk was used to block the nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against biglycan (1:1000, Proteintech) and GAPDH (1:3000, SAB) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The secondary antibody (1:5000, Bioss) was applied on the following day, and the reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (ECL, Affinity).Statistical methodsThe best cutoff values for specific markers in each cohort were determined using the survminer package. The survival package was used for Kaplan-Meier overall survival analysis, and the log-rank test was applied for comparison. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated via univariate Cox regression. Immune signatures were divided into two groups according to the median value and calculated by Cox regression in. Student\u2019s t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for comparison of normally and non-normally distributed variables in unpaired groups, respectively. The paired Student\u2019s t-test was performed for paired samples. Chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were applied for comparison of clinical features. The Spearman method was applied for correlation analysis. All P values were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software (Version 3.5.3, https://www.r-project.org).ResultsCAF marker-based classifier identified three clusters with different CAF infiltration in TNBC cohortsClustering of classic CAF markers in the TCGA-TNBC cohort. a, Heatmap showing the expression level of CAF markers and clustering of CAF infiltration in the TCGA-TNBC (N =\u00a0116) cohort.

P values are reported as: ns, nonsignificant; *, P <\u00a0.05; **, P <\u00a0.01; ***, P <\u00a0.001; ****, P <\u00a0.0001.Continued.Continued.The relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC was estimated by expression profile clustering using classic CAF markers reported in previous studies, including ACTA2, FAP, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, PDPN, THY1 and COL1A1. The expression level of the above markers in CAFs of breast cancer was examined using single-cell sequencing datasets (Figure S1). Samples from the TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC, GSE21653 and GSE103091 cohorts were analyzed. The clustering results of TCGA-TNBC, METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC are shown in Figure 1a, S2a and S2c, and patients were divided into different CAF infiltration groups, namely, low, medium and high infiltration. The distributions of clinical or biological features, such as the ESTIMATE stromal score, immune score, mutation type, age at diagnosis, TNM stage, subtypes, amongst others, were displayed under the heatmap. PCA plots were employed to verify the clustering efficacy in the cohorts (Figure 1b, S2b, S2d). To further examine whether the clustering groups reflect the relative abundance of CAFs in the TME, we compared the CAF scores reported in previous studies and demonstrated an ascending tendency of MCP-counter and xCell scores in the low, medium and high CAF infiltration groups of representative cohorts (Figure 2a, 2d, 2g). Moreover, the expression of iCAF and myCAF markers was also compared. The results showed that lots of CAF markers were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups (Figure 2b, 2e, 2h). The results indicated that samples in these groups showed abundant infiltrating CAFs. The CAF infiltration clusters of all TNBC cohorts in this study are shown in Figure S3a. The overall survival did not show a significant difference among the CAF infiltration groups (Figure S3b-f).

Prognostic signatures for overall survival are marked with dark dots in the nodes.Previous studies have indicated the crucial role of CAFs in immune modulation of the microenvironment. Here, we sought to examine the correlation between CAFs and the immune landscape. First, we calculated the fold change of genes between different infiltration groups (high vs. low, medium vs. low) in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts and the immune-related genes were shown (Figure 2c, 2f, 2i). The results indicated that some of them were upregulated in the high and medium infiltration groups of different cohorts, such as CD14, TGFB3, ENTPD1, NT5E and BMP1. Other upregulated markers were not consistent in different cohorts, such as LAG3, CD33, CD68, CXCL9, and IL6. Second, the GSVA scores of hallmark signaling pathways in cancer were compared between the high- and low-infiltration groups (Figure 3a-c). Some of the immune-related signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the high infiltration group, such as TGF-\u03b2, IL2-STAT5, complement, TNF-\u03b1-NF-\u03baB and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. Finally, as CAFs are one of the producers of TGF-\u03b2, we compared the expression levels of the TGF-\u03b2 response signatures of fibroblasts (F-TBRS), T cells (T-TBRS), macrophages (Ma-TBRS) and endothelial cells (End-TBRS). Most signatures showed an ascending tendency from the low- to high-infiltration groups (Figure S4).Based on the results above and previous studies, CAFs might exert their function by affecting tumors and immune cells. We evaluated the correlation between previously reported CAF scores and CIBERSORTx immune cells (Figure 3d-f). The CAF scores estimated by xCell, EPIC and MCP-counter were analyzed. CAFs were negatively correlated with cytotoxic cells, including CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and activated NK cells. In the METABRIC-TNBC cohort, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell, respectively. But only MCP-counter-CAF was negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. In the TCGA-TNBC cohort, EPIC-CAF, MCP-counter-CAF and xCell-CAF were all negatively correlated with CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell. But only EPIC-CAF and MCP-counter-CAF were negatively correlated with activated NK cell. In the GSE25066-TNBC cohort, only a negative correlation between xCell-CAF and CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell was observed. Moreover, CAFs might exhibit significantly positive correlations with M2 macrophages and this result was only observed in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, xCell-CAF and EPIC-CAF were risk factors for overall survival in METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively.BGN is upregulated and mainly expressed in stromal CAFsBGN is upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts. a, Illustration showing the procedure of RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis for tissue-derived fibroblasts and culture medium, respectively.

P value from paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Here, we sought to investigate effective biomarkers derived from CAFs and their corresponding prognostic value. Normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts were isolated from tissue samples after surgical resection. RNA sequencing and label-free mass spectrometry were further applied to explore the transcriptomic expression profile and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the NAF and CAF groups (Figure 4a). The top 40 expressed DEGs in CAFs are shown in Figure 4b. The label-free mass spectrometry identified the top 40 secreted proteins (Figure 4c). BGN, an extracellular protein, was upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs. Previous studies indicated the roles of BGN in therapy resistance and immune activity. Overexpression of biglycan induced resistance to 5-FU and rapamycin in cancer cells via NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Besides, most mechanistic studies mainly focused on the interaction between biglycan and toll-like receptors (TLR2/4). However, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects tumor microenvironment in other ways is still poorly understood despite its abundance in TME. The TPM values of BGN from RNA sequencing were compared (Figure 4d). We further compared the BGN level in the TCGA-TNBC cohort and observed a significantly higher level of BGN in tumor tissues (Figure 4e). We further verified our results at the protein level by Western blotting and observed a significantly higher level of biglycan protein in CAFs of patient 1, 2 and 3 (Figure 4f). To further confirm the expression profile of BGN in different tumor components, we analyzed its expression pattern using microdissection and single-cell sequencing datasets. Microdissection analysis (GSE88715) indicated a higher level of BGN expression in the stromal part of the tumor (Figure 4g). Moreover, BGN expression showed an ascending tendency from the low to high CAF infiltration group described above (Figure S5a). The expression level of BGN was also positively correlated with classic CAF markers in each cohort (Figure S5b).BGN expression in single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of TNBC. a-c, Violin plots showing the expression level of BGN in cells of scRNA-seq datasets (Bassez A ; GSE118389; Wu SZ). d, Scatter plot showing the cell clusters in c (Wu SZ). e, Scatter plot showing the distribution of cells expressing a high level of BGN in c.The correlation of BGN and CAF scores and pathway enrichment. a-c, Scatter plots showing the correlation between BGN and CAFs and endothelial cells.

Enrichment Score from the Gene Ontology enrichment.To further confirm its expression feature in TNBC, we sought to analyze the BGN expression level in TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. BGN was mainly expressed in the overall fibroblasts of TNBC cohorts (Bassez A, et al.; GSE118389; Figure 5a, 5b). In another dataset with more detailed cell clusters, BGN was mainly expressed in CAFs and perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations (Wu SZ, et al.; Figure 5c-e). The BGN expression level was significantly correlated with the scores of fibroblasts and endothelial cells estimated by MCP-counter and xCell in these cohorts, respectively (Figure 6a-c-). This result provided additional evidence for the derivation of biglycan. These results further indicated that BGN might be a CAF-specific biomarker in TNBC and exert its function in the extracellular matrix.  Biglycan correlates biological features and clinical outcomesThe correlation between BGN and immune features. a, Heatmap showing the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes. b, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and ESTIMATE stromal and immune scores. c, Bubble plot showing the correlation between BGN and CIBERSORT-derived immune cell scores. Positive and negative correlations are shown as red and blue, respectively. Correlation coefficients and P values from the Spearman method.The BGN gene encodes biglycan, an extracellular soluble protein that might exert its function via intercellular contact. Here, we sought to explore its role in tumor development and its prognostic value in clinical practice. GO signaling enrichment was performed using BGN-correlated genes, and the representative results are shown in Figure 6d-f. Representative signaling pathways involved in cancer progression and TME modulation were significantly enriched in METABRIC-TNBC, TCGA-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC cohorts (FDR<0.05). The high BGN level indicates the extension of new blood vessels from the existing vessels (SPROUTING_ANGIOGENESIS), lymph vessel formation (LYMPHANGIOGENESIS), extracellular matrix remodeling (COLLAGEN_CONTAINING_ECM) and promotion of tumor cell metastasis (POSITIVE_REGULATION_OF_EMT). Furthermore, BGN was also correlated with the formation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment (TGF_BETA_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING). These results indicated that biglycan might be associated with tumor angiogenesis, TME remodeling and tumor metastasis in TNBC. Hence it might serve as a protumor and immunosuppressive factor in these cohorts. Therefore, we further analyzed the association between BGN and the immune signatures. First, the correlation between BGN and immune-related genes was analyzed (Figure 7a). BGN was positively correlated with some immune-inhibitory molecules, including TGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB and CD276, especially in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. However, we did not observe significant association with classic checkpoint molecules except for CTLA4 and CD274 (PD-L1) in GSE103091 and BTLA in GSE21653. These results imply that BGN might affect immune cell infiltration or modulate immune activity. Hence, we calculated the correlation between BGN expression and ESTIMATE scores (Figure 7b). The BGN was significantly positively correlated with the stromal scores in each cohort. We observed significant correlations between BGN and the immune scores in METABRIC-TNBC (negative, P <\u00a0.05), GSE21653 (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and GSE103091 (negative, P <\u00a0.1). Finally, we examined the correlation between BGN and immune components. BGN was significantly correlated with both CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) and activated NK cells (negative, P <\u00a0.05) in the METABRIC-TNBC and TCGA-TNBC cohorts, respectively. Moreover, BGN was correlated with M0 macrophages in all cohorts (positive, P <\u00a0.05) except for GSE21653 and M2 macrophages in METABRIC-TNBC, GSE25066-TNBC and GSE103091 (positive, P <\u00a0.05) (Figure 7c).

High-biglycan and low-biglycan groups are shown as red and blue.Since BGN plays an essential role in the biological process of cancer, we further sought to examine its clinical relevance. First, we observed a significantly lower level of BGN in TNBC than in non-TNBC samples of the TCGA and METABRIC cohorts (Figure S6a). BGN expression was significantly upregulated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues in the TCGA-TNBC cohort (Figure S6b). Second, the Cox regression model was conducted according to the best cutoff value for overall survival and indicated that BGN was a poor prognostic predictor in the METABRIC-TNBC, GSE103091 and GSE21653 cohorts (Figure S6c). Besides, FAP predicted poor prognosis in TCGA-TNBC and GSE21653 cohorts. PDGFRB and COL1A1 predicted poor outcomes in TCGA-TNBC and GSE103091 cohorts. However, PDGFRA was predictive of favorable outcomes in cohorts except for TCGA-TNBC and PDPN predicted favorable prognosis in METABRIC-TNBC and GSE25066-TNBC cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that a higher BGN expression level predicted worse overall survival outcomes in each cohort (Figure 8a). Finally, we also validated the prognostic value and immunosuppressive function of biglycan in the SYSUCC cohort. Patients in the high-biglycan group showed a lower level of total infiltrating CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells (Figure 8b, 8c). Survival analyses demonstrated that biglycan might serve as a poor prognostic marker in TNBC (Figure 8d, Table S2). The univariate and multivariate Cox regression model for the SYSUCC cohort indicated that biglycan was an independent risk factor for overall survival (Table S3). DiscussionRecent studies have indicated the crucial roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer. Many of them focus on the heterogeneity and corresponding biological features of different CAF clusters in cancer. However, the detailed mechanism underlying how CAFs affect the TME has been a prominent topic in recent years.Here, we have included the expression profile of the tumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the characteristics of fibroblasts in triple-negative breast cancer. We evaluated the relative abundance of fibroblasts in TNBC and further identified an extracellular secreted protein, biglycan, as a biomarker for CAFs and a predictor for poor prognosis in TNBC.CAFs have been reported to be a tumor-promoting component of the stroma in most cancers. In previous studies, fibroblasts exerted their function by producing excreted factors, remodeling the extracellular matrix, influencing cancer cell metabolism and direct cell-cell interactions. For example, CAF-derived PLGF and BDNF promote NR4A1 expression in triple-negative breast cancer cells and enhance invasiveness. In addition, CCL2/7 are produced by lung-resident fibroblasts to modify cancer cell metabolism by activating cholesterol synthesis in TNBC cells in the lung and promoting angiogenesis. Furthermore, CAFs serve as leading cells for cancer cells during cell migration. Fibroblasts pave the way for subsequent malignant cells and lead to tumor invasion by direct cell-to-cell contact. Here, we sought to explore the effect of the relative abundance of CAFs in TNBC. The CAF infiltration level affects tumor cells and the TME with different CAF, immune and tumor cell expression profiles. Although some immune markers show an ascending tendency from low to high CAF infiltration levels (CD14, NT5E and ENTPD1, etc.), some other markers do not. This is consistent with a previous study which indicates that fibroblast-enriched samples might be clustered into fibrotic (F) and immune-enriched/fibrotic (IE/F) groups with distinct features. Furthermore, the simple relative abundance of CAF infiltration did not necessarily seem to be a prognostic predictor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that CAFs are highly heterogeneous and different subpopulations display various features. Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are commonly divided into inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) with lower \u03b1-SMA and higher cytokine production, and myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) with higher levels of \u03b1-SMA. Recently, a novel cluster of antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) was identified, and CAFs were confirmed to directly participate in immune reactions. The reason why high infiltration group exhibited a higher level of BGN might be partially due to a larger amount of overall CAFs. But it is not capable of predicting the dominant role of BGN-expression CAFs. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of CAFs is more important than simply cell abundance. A single-cell sequencing cohort of TNBC with a large population and active follow-up data will help to clarify the role of the amounts of overall CAFs and specific dominant subclusters in predicting clinical outcomes in future studies.Furthermore, internal heterogeneity in the cellular population poses a new challenge in modern medicine. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has helped to explore single-cell expression profiles and identify internal heterogeneous clusters of cells. Infiltrating CAF-S1 is enriched in TNBC, and further clustering by single-cell sequencing reveals 8 subclusters with distinct features, in which Clusters 0/3 are linked to immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Together, these results imply that specific CAF subpopulations might truly matter instead of simply the number of infiltrating fibroblasts in TNBC. Hence, it is more important to explore the expression profile of CAFs.As CAF-derived proteins represent the most common way for intercellular crosstalk and might serve as biomarkers for cancer, we used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology, and identified the coding gene for biglycan, BGN, to be mainly expressed in CAFs. The biglycan protein belongs to the SLRP family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, although BGN was found to be upregulated in CAFs compared to NAFs, it also seemed to be expressed in endothelial cells. A previous study reported that BGN was approximately 100-fold more abundant in tumor endothelial cells than in corresponding normal endothelial cells. In another study, the results from scRNA-seq indicated that BGN is also expressed in perivascular-like subclusters except for CAFs. However, this is not contradictory to our findings, as endothelial cells and pericytes are commonly recognized as crucial origins for CAFs and transform into CAFs under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the number of fibroblasts was far greater than that of endothelial cells in scRNA-seq datasets, which indicates that CAFs are the major origin of biglycan proteins. BGN expression correlates with poor overall survival, cancer biological processes and microenvironmental components. Biglycan is a nonfibrillar component in the ECM, suggesting that extracellular biglycan might not only constitute the ECM but also exert other functions. BGN encodes a secreted protein that could bind to receptors on immune cells and it might also potentially interact with tumor cells, pericytes or endothelial cells. The Gene Ontology enrichment in this study implies the potential role of BGN in tumor vasculature and our findings are consistent with previous studies that CAFs promoted tumor angiogenesis mainly by releasing secreted factors, such as SDF1, MMPs and VEGFs. Biglycan is a vital component in bone and might promote the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells through an LPR6/\u03b2-catenin/IGFR-IR axis. Other studies indicate that biglycan might enhance drug resistance in cancer cells. These studies imply that biglycan promotes cancer progression by cell crosstalk. In previous studies, soluble biglycan was found to interact with CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4), leading to the activation of downstream NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 signaling. TLR2/4 are membrane receptors for various immune cells and modulate the immune response in the TME. Previous studies have confirmed the role of TLR4 in the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages and the conversion of CAFs, tumor-associated dendritic cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. On the basis of previous studies, we might hypothesize that biglycan exerts its function as a secreted ligand and modulates the downstream signalings by interacting with corresponding receptors on other cells. These results suggest that biglycan might play a crucial role in immune modulation and tumor angiogenesis.We also realize the limitations of our study. First, the relative abundance of fibroblasts was evaluated by a clustering method using classic CAF markers with higher specificity instead of all well-known fibroblast markers. Comprehensive clustering method and single-cell sequencing data were applied to enhance the specificity, but the similarity of expression profiles in CAFs and vascular cells might still confound our analysis. Besides, the results are only comparable within each cohort. Second, sampling bias might occur because the fraction of the stromal part varies in different samples due to the internal heterogeneity of the tumor bulk. Bulk sequencing might not truly reflect the overall landscape of tumors. Third, the mechanical and chemical effects during isolation of primary cells from tissues and in vitro cells culture might change the phenotype of fibroblasts, leading to detection bias in the experiments. Finally, the mechanism underlying how biglycan affects the TME was not explored in this study. Further investigations about how biglycan affects tumor cells and immune components, such as CD8\u00a0+\u00a0T cells and macrophages, will advance our understanding of the roles of CAFs in TNBC.Notably, we observed that biglycan was upregulated and secreted in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with normal cancer-adjacent fibroblasts. The expression of BGN was significantly correlated with overall clinical survival and biological processes in TNBC, suggesting that biglycan might play a crucial role in cell-to-cell crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. Moreover, we confirmed the prognostic value of biglycan in TNBC using the cancer tissue microarray. Interestingly, BGN was not significantly correlated with classic checkpoint molecules in most cohorts. But we observed an evident positive correlation between BGN and TGF-\u03b2, a well-known immunosuppressive molecule, indicating that BGN might exert its effect on immune activity in a certain way. Besides, BGN might participate in tumor angiogenesis which is also a prominent target to synergize with immunotherapy.In conclusion, we identified that CAF-derived biglycan is crucial for TNBC progression. The upregulation of biglycan and the mechanism underlying how biglycan exerts its function in the TME may serve as a promising diagnostic biomarker and may provide more promising strategies for cancer treatment.Supplementary MaterialContributorsAll authors participated in the study planning and analysis or laboratory experiments.

Our findings have defined a molecular mechanism in the tumor microenvironment that is a novel target for cancer therapy.INTRODUCTIONThe tumor microenvironment is now recognized to have an important role in cancer progression. Advanced stages of neoplasia require the co-evolution and continuous cross-talk between cancer and stromal cells. During tumorigenesis, malignant cells accumulate a large number of chromosomal aberrations and epigenetic changes. However, their interactions with surrounding cells of the microenvironment provide additional critical factors that determine whether they remain dormant or develop into invasive and metastatic cancer cells.The tumor microenvironment consists of various nontransformed cells including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, leukocytes, endothelial cells and bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are among the most abundant cells in the stroma of solid tumors and are characterized by diverse phenotypes. They support tumor progression through the secretion of growth factors, suppression of host immune responses and deposition of specialized extracellular matrix. Extensive infiltration of carcinomas with activated myofibroblasts, a type of CAF, is correlated with higher grades of malignancy and a poor prognosis. Importantly, CAFs preserve their tumor-promoting properties when cultured in vitro in the absence of direct contact with cancer cells. This property makes them a valuable tool to study the effects of the microenvironment on tumorigenesis.Despite the extensive research demonstrating the role of the microenvironment in tumor progression, our understanding of the genes and pathways responsible for the formation of tumor-promoting stroma is still limited. Some genetic alterations have been reported in microdissected stroma from paraffin-fixed tissues, notably the loss of p53. However, it is not clear that the loss of p53 expression can induce differentiation of progenitor cells or resident fibroblasts into CAFs. Moreover, comprehensive analyses of isolated stromal cells from fresh-frozen tissues, including comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism, failed to identify substantial genetic alterations in CAFs. This raises the possibility that changes in gene expression in CAFs may result from epigenetic modifications. Indeed, altered methylation patterns have been observed not only in tumor cells but also in stromal fibroblasts.Another mechanism that may contribute to the activation of fibroblasts and progenitor cells is post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs. Because individual microRNAs regulate hundreds of genes, they could account for the dramatic changes in gene expression seen in CAFs. MicroRNAs are 19\u201325 nucleotide RNAs that control diverse biological processes. Usually, they bind to a complementary site in the 3\u2032-UTR of their target transcripts, resulting in translational inhibition or messenger RNA degradation. Recent data clearly indicate that microRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in different tumor types.We previously identified a microRNA signature in CAFs freshly isolated from human endometrial cancer, including several microRNAs that had been implicated in various stages of tumorigenesis. For example, the upregulated miR-146 and miR-424 have been associated with an angiogenic switch in a mouse RIP-tag model of pancreatic cancer. Downregulation of miR-31 in CAFs and the corresponding increased expression of homeobox gene SATB2 contributed to the migration and invasiveness of endometrial tumor cells. The downregulation of miR-148a, which we also detected in CAFs, has been recognized as a metastatic marker for a number of other tumors. A connection between inhibition of miR-148a expression and tumor metastasis was reinforced by a study that documented the silencing of this microRNA by gene methylation in several metastatic tumors (n = 207) and showed a strong correlation of silencing with lymph node-positive disease. Although several target genes of miR-148 have been identified, how its suppression promotes cancer metastasis remains a subject of investigation. In the present study, we further documented the downregulation of miR-148a in endometrial cancer CAFs, showed that methylation contributed to its suppression and established that WNT10B is a direct target of its activity. A decrease in miR-148a expression in CAFs resulted in an upregulation of secreted WNT10B protein, which stimulated the motility of endometrial cancer cells.RESULTSmiR-148a expression is suppressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts The isolation and characterization of fibroblasts from endometrial cancer and matched normal endometrial tissue was described previously. Initially, microarray analysis identified 11 microRNAs that were differentially expressed in CAFs. Here, we focused on miR-148a because its downregulation has been associated with metastasis in a variety of settings. The contrast in miR-148a expression was further validated in 16 pairs of normal and cancer fibroblasts by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 1a). The miR-148a expression level was downregulated in CAFs relative to normal tissue fibroblasts (NFs) in 15 out of 16 cases (94%). However, we noticed a large range of variability in miR-148a expression among NFs from individual patients. To see if expression of miR-148a in NFs and CAFs can be discriminated at the global level, we normalized the quantity of miR-148a transcript in all NFs and CAFs to the NF1 sample (patient 1) and plotted the two groups separately (Figure 1b). This analysis revealed a statistically significant downregulation of miR-148a in CAFs with P = 0.0014. To minimize the impact of cell propagation on plastic, we performed our experiments with early passages of cells, typically passage 3 to 6. However, there is a possibility that the expression of microRNA changes as a result of adaptation to cell culture conditions. Therefore, to confirm the lower expression of miR-148a in stromal cells of endometrial tumors, we obtained stromal cells from three normal endometrial tissues and three endometrial cancers using laser-capture microdissection. Expression of miR-148a was significantly higher in the stroma dissected from normal tissue than stroma from endometrial cancer (Figure 1c). We also microdissected cells from normal endometrial glands, endometrial stroma and myometrium, and found no significant differences in miR-148a expression among these compartments (Supplementary Figures S1a and S1 b). This reinforced the view that downregulation of miR-148a in cancer-associated stroma was specifically characteristic of malignant transformation.The miR-148a gene is located in a CpG-rich region of the genome, consistent with its methylation-dependent silencing in pancreatic cancer and in lymph node metastases of colon cancer, head and neck cancer and melanoma. Based on these observations, we tested the hypothesis that silencing of miR-148a in CAFs is mediated by promoter methylation. We analyzed miR-148a expression in 15 pairs of fibroblast cell lines after treatment with the DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5azaC) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). The majority of CAFs (11 out of 15) showed increased expression of miR-148a after treatment with 5azaC + TSA relative to untreated cells (Supplementary Figure S2). However, bisulfite sequencing analysis indicated that CpG methylation of the miR-148a gene was not increased in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S3), implying that the effect of 5azaC + TSA was indirect. Moreover, methylation was not the only mechanism of miR-148 silencing because three CAF lines did not re-express miR-148a after treatment even though their miR-148a transcript level was low compared with the matched normal counterparts.Restoration of miR-148a expression in CAFs reduced their chemoattractant propertiesTo study the function of miR-148a in fibroblasts, we used a lentiviral vector to re-introduce it into CAF cell lines having very low endogenous levels. The vector also encoded green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the Zeocin-resistance gene. As a control, CAF cells were infected in parallel with empty vector. After selection with antibiotic more than 95% of cells were GFP positive as measured by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. The expression of miR-148a did not affect fibroblast morphology or growth (Supplementary Figures S4a and S4b). CM from these fibroblasts had a diminished chemoattractant effect on five different endometrial cancer cell lines compared with CM from the same fibroblast line expressing the empty vector (Figure 2a). We also used a reverse approach to inhibit miR-148a activity in normal fibroblasts with a lentiviral anti-miR-148a construct. Migration of the same endometrial tumor cells was increased when they were incubated with CM from fibroblasts in which miR-148a activity was disrupted (Figure 2b). In contrast, we did not observe any difference in growth of tumor cells when the five cancer cell lines were co-cultured with CAFs infected with the lentivirus encoding miR-148a vs. empty vector (Figure 2c). Moreover, there was no difference in the growth of the cancer cells when they were treated for 2 weeks with CM from CAFs expressing miR-148a vs empty vector (data not shown).miR-148a expression in CAFs decreased cancer cell invasion in matrigel cultureIn vivo, cells are surrounded by extracellular matrix, which affects the cellular phenotype and homeostasis. Because such regulation may be lost when cells are cultured on plastic, we tested the ability of endometrial cancer cell lines to grow in a three-dimensional (3D) matrigel culture. The ACI-158 cell line showed robust growth in matrigel when supported with media containing 10% FBS (data not shown). However, only isolated colonies were detected after 5 days in culture when the serum concentration was reduced to 2% (Figure 3a). Cells incubated with CM from CAFs expressing empty vector (also containing 2% FBS) showed a distinctly invasive phenotype with long projections that created a branched morphology in matrigel (Figure 3b). The invasive phenotype was nearly eliminated when cells were incubated with CM from CAFs expressing miR-148a (Figure 3c). Furthermore, inhibition of miR-148a activity in NFs by anti-miR-148a induced tumor cell growth in matrigel (Figure 3e) compared with control NFs expressing the empty vector (Figure 3d). These results suggested that miR-148a suppressed the expression of one or more factors that promoted the invasive phenotype of ACI-158 cancer cells in matrigel culture.WNT10B is a direct target of miR-148a in CAFsPredicted targets for miR-148 include several growth factors that might regulate tumor progression, such as TGF\u03b1, M-CSF, KITL (stem cell factor) and two members of the WNT family, WNT1 and WNT10B. ELISA analysis revealed no differences in the levels of TGF\u03b1, M-CSF or KITL in the CM of CAFs overexpressing miR-148a vs. empty vector or in CM from NFs vs CAFs. We then screened previously obtained CAF and NF mRNA microarray data for evidence of WNT pathway activation using human fibroblast-specific WNT target genes identified by Klapholz-Brown et al. Among the genes differentially expressed by CAFs, we observed a significant enrichment in WNT-responsive genes (Figure 4a). The differential level of WNT target gene expression, as determined by SLEPR analysis of pathway enrichment, is illustrated by the heat map of individual fibroblasts cell lines used in microarray experiments (Figure 4b). The heat map shows that expression of these genes in CAF samples varies significantly relative to levels observed in NF samples. To confirm these results, we also used the significance analysis of microarrays method, which showed that almost all WNT-responsive genes (96%) were upregulated in CAFs (Supplementary Figure S5).To verify activation of WNT signaling in CAFs, we transfected different NFs and matching CAFs with a SuperTOPFIash reporter vector which measures activity in the canonical WNT/(\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. SuperTOPFIash luciferase activity, normalized to either renilla-TK or the negative control SuperFOPFIash vector, was much more robust in CAFs than in NFs (Figure 4c). Western blot analysis of WNT10B and WNT1 expression in a panel of endometrial NFs and CAFs revealed greater amounts of WNT10B protein in the majority of CAFs than in the corresponding NFs (Figure 4d). Overall, a negative correlation was observed between WNT10B protein level and miR-148a expression. WNT1 expression was not detected in NFs or CAFs by quantitative RT\u2013PCR or western blot analysis. Therefore, we focused our study on WNT10B.To prove that WNT10B is a direct target of miR-148a, we used a 3\u2032-UTR sequence of WNT10B cloned into a reporter vector downstream of the luciferase complementary DNA (cDNA) (Figure 5a). Co-transfection of this construct with miR-148a or control microRNA into HeLa cells showed that miR-148a suppressed expression of the WNT10B reporter (Figure 5b). Mutation of the miR-148a binding site abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-148a on the reporter activity (Figure 5b). Consistent with these results, miR-148a decreased SuperTOPFIash reporter activity in CAFs (Figure 5c). Furthermore, miR-148a decreased the expression of WNT10B protein in CAFs (Figure 5d), and anti-miR-148a increased WNT10B protein in NF (Figure 5e), reinforcing the idea that WNT10B is a direct target of miR-148a in fibroblasts.WNT10B stimulates migration of endometrial cancer cellsBecause miR-148a expression in CAFs inhibited the chemoattractant activity of their CM (Figure 2a), we hypothesized that WNT10B might stimulate tumor cell motility. To address this idea, we overexpressed WNT10B or an empty plasmid in 293T cells and tested the CM from these cells in a transwell migration assay. The three endometrial cancer cell lines used in this assay showed a significantly stronger response towards WNT10B than control CM (Figure 6a). As the ACI-158 line showed the strongest response to WNT10B, we used it in the subsequent experiments. To confirm that endometrial cancer cell migration was due to WNT10B, we treated the CM from CAFs with anti-WNT10B antibody or control IgG to remove WNT10B from the medium. The ability of the antibody to immunoprecipitate WNT10B was verified by western blotting (Supplementary Figure S6). WNT10B immunodepletion diminished the activity of CM in a \u03b2-catenin stabilization assay (Figure 6b). Importantly, the WNT10B-depleted CAF CM also had markedly reduced activity in the ACI-158 endometrial cancer cell migration assay (Figure 6c).To strengthen the functional link between miR-148a and WNT10B, we tested the effect of ectopic miR-148a-resistant, WNT10B expression on chemoattractant activity of CM from CAFs transduced with miR-148a construct. The results presented in Figure 6d demonstrate that WNT10B stimulated endometrial cancer cell migration. Moreover, immunodepletion of WNT10B from the CM of NFs transduced with anti-miR-148a plasmid inhibited cell migration, indicating that WNT10B was a functionally important target of miR-148a (Figure 6e).WNT10B has been reported to stimulate both \u03b2-catenin-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. To further dissect the mechanism of WNT10B-mediated cell migration, we pre-treated cells with the specific WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway antagonist Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) or added the general WNT antagonist, secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1) to the CM. As expected, both inhibited CAF CM activity in the \u03b2-catenin stabilization assay (Figure 7a). However, only sFRP1 decreased the motility of ACI-158 cells in response to CAF CM (Figure 7b), implying that non-canonical WNT signaling was responsible for tumor cell migration.DISCUSSIONThe present study was undertaken to investigate the significance of miR-148a silencing in endometrial CAFs. We demonstrated that CAF CM promoted the migration and invasive properties of endometrial cancer cells in a miR-148a-dependent manner. Previous work had indicated that miR-148a expression was decreased in various metastatic cancers. However, this is the first report to demonstrate that miR-148a silencing in CAFs contributed to tumor cell motility. We established that WNT10B is a direct target of miR-148a, and immunodepletion experiments revealed that WNT10B was responsible for much of the tumor cell chemoattractant activity in CAF CM. The association of cell motility with non-canonical Wnt signaling was consistent with several other studies concerning cell migration and metastasis. Our results suggest that miR-148a silencing and WNT10B derepression in CAFs may contribute to the metastasis of other tumors besides endometrial cancers. More generally, they emphasize a role for microRNA in regulating the characteristics of cells in the tumor microenvironment that influence cancer cell behavior.There is precedent for a connection between WNT activity and endometrial cancer. Previously, we observed that the expression of sFRP1 and sFRP4 was suppressed in a subset of endometrial carcinomas. Subsequently, sFRP4 was identified as an endometrial stromal marker that inhibited cancer cell growth and was downregulated in CAFs and endometrial cancers. The current findings indicate that in addition to the reduced expression of these WNT antagonists, endometrial cancers are characterized by the upregulation of WNT10B in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, oncogenic \u03b2-catenin mutations were reported in 15\u201340% of endometrial cancer patients, and 31 to 85% of well-differentiated endometrioid carcinomas contained nuclear \u03b2-catenin. Endometrial tumors also were associated with APC promoter hypermethylation and truncation mutations. These observations imply that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling contributes to endometrial malignancy, although our data suggest that this pathway was not involved in paracrine-mediated tumor cell motility.WNT10B has varying effects on cancer in other organs. Transgenic mice overexpressing WNT10B develop adenocarcinomas in the breast, and cell lines established from these tumors displayed anchorage-independent growth. However, WNT10B overexpression suppressed the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells In vitro and in vivo, although it promoted tumor growth and metastasis when co-expressed with FGF-2. WNT10B reportedly elicited a stronger chemotactic response from metastatic osteosarcoma cells than non-metastatic cells.The relevance of WNT regulation by miR-148a might extend beyond cancer and WNT10B. Inhibition of WNT10B expression is a key factor in the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes. Recently, Qin et al. reported that miR-148a was among a set of miRs that were upregulated during adipogenesis. We speculate that this increase in miR-148a contributes to the silencing of WNT10B required for adipogenesis. As noted above, WNT1 is a potential target of miR-148a, but this was not germane to the present study because WNT1 was not expressed by endometrial CAFs. We verified that its expression is decreased by miR-148a in HeLa cells (unpublished observations, OA), indicating that WNT1 is a bona fide target of miR-148a activity. However, others have detected little or no regulation of WNT1 or WNT10B expression by miR148a or miR148b in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that inhibition is dependent on cellular context.Besides its effect on adjacent cancer cells, the upregulation of WNT10B in CAFs might have a direct impact on the \u2018activated\u2019 fibroblast phenotype. WNT10B overexpression was documented in skin biopsy specimens from patients with systemic sclerosis and from mice with bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Transgenic mice expressing WNT10B were characterized by dermal fibrosis with fibroblast activation, myofibroblast accumulation and increased collagen deposition. These data suggest that WNT10B stimulates the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells into activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and maintains these populations during tumorigenesis.In summary, we identified WNT10B as a direct target of miR-148a in CAFs from endometrial cancers and demonstrated that its upregulation in these cells increases tumor cell motility. Together with other factors regulated by miR-148a, this might be a general mechanism of metastasis in tumors with reduced miR-148a expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell linesAll fibroblast cells were derived from patients undergoing operations for endometrial cancer and characterized as previously described. The primary fibroblast lines were tested for mycoplasma, the presence of fibroblast-specific markers (vimentin, FSP1 and FAP1), and were selected to have more than 90% cytokeratin-negative cells. The protocols for human tissues that were followed to obtain the fibroblast lines had been approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Virginia and National Cancer Institute. Endometrial cancer cell lines were established by JIR and described in Nagendra et al. Tumor cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination and used after at least 30 passages. All cells were cultured in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) under standard culture conditions.PlasmidsThe lentiviral expression vector for miR-148a (pMIF-cGFP-Zeo-miR148a) and the control vector (pMIF-cGFP-Zeo), as well as the anti-miR-148a construct and its control (pGreenPuro Scramble Hairpin Control) were purchased from System Biosciences (SBI, Mountain View, CA, USA). A plasmid with the WNT10B 3\u2032-UTR cloned into a reporter vector (pLightSwithch_3\u2032UTR-WNT10B) and the control empty vector (pLightS-witch_3\u2032UTR) were purchased from Switch Gear Genomics Inc. (Menlo Park, CA, USA). MiR-148a-binding sites in the reporter vector were mutated using QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis.Real-time PCRTotal RNA was isolated from cells by TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen). TaqMan miRNA assays were used to quantify the level of mature miR-148a (probe 4373130, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Briefly, 50 ng of total RNA were reverse-transcribed in 15 \u03bcl reaction according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1.33 \u03bcl of the resultant reaction was PCR-amplified in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl for 40 cycles using Applied Biosystems 7500 instrument. Small nuclear RNA RNU6B was used as a standard for normalization. All reactions were performed in triplicate.Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of methylation-dependent miR-148a derepression was performed after fibroblasts were treated with 3 \u03bcM 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-azaC) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 6 days with addition of fresh 5-azaC every other day. The last treatment was accompanied by addition of 150nM TSA (Sigma) and cells were collected 24 h later for microRNA analysis.Transwell migration assay5 \u00d7 104 fibroblasts expressing miR-148a or empty vector were seeded into 24-well plates in DMEM containing 2% FBS. In 2 days, 1\u20133 \u00d7 104 endometrial cancer cells in serum-free media were placed in Boyden chambers (8 \u03bcm, BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) and allowed to migrate towards the fibroblast-CM for 24 h. Cells were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick Stain Set (Dade Behring Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA). The cells that migrated through the pores of the membrane were photographed and quantified using Image J software. All experiments were done in triplicate and three images were processed per each membrane.The experiments with ACI-158 cells described in Figures 6b\u2013e and Figure 7b were performed with serum-free CM from CAFs or NFs collected after 48 h. Where indicated, CAF CM or Wnt3a CM (collected from L929 cells overexpressing recombinant Wnt3a, ATCC) was pre-incubated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of purified recombinant sFRP1 protein at 4\u00b0C for 30 min and used as chemoattractant for ACI-158 cell migration. To inhibit the canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway by DKK1, ACI-158 cells were trypsinized, washed, counted and incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of DKK1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in serum-free medium for 30 min at room temperature. Then 5 \u00d7 104 cells were placed in Boyden chambers for migration towards CAF CM or Wnt3a CM.Co-culture of endometrial cancer cells with fibroblastsA total of 3 \u00d7 104 fibroblasts and 1 \u00d7 104 endometrial cancer cells stably transfected with a luciferase cDNA were seeded in triplicate in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS into 12-well plates. The tumor cell growth was monitored by measuring luciferase activity using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wl, USA). For the long-term co-culture experiment, only endometrial cancer cell lines were seeded on the plates and allowed to grow in the CM collected from fibroblasts expressing miR-148a or empty vector control. The CM was replaced twice a week for two weeks.3D culture of endometrial cancer cellsGrowth factor-reduced matrigel (BD Biosciences) was thawed on ice, and 50 \u03bcl were used to coat wells in pre-chilled 96-well plates. The matrigel was allowed to solidify at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Cells were trypsinized, counted and resuspended in DMEM-supplemented with 2 FBS and 4% matrigel. A total of 2 \u00d7 103 cells were plated on top of the matrigel and allowed to attach overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Next morning, the medium was replaced with 80 \u03bcl of DMEM/2% FBS, CM from CAFs that expressed the empty vector control or miR-148a and had been cultured for 2 days in DMEM/2% FBS, or with CM from NFs that expressed empty vector or anti-miR-148a and had been similarly cultured. Media were replaced every other day and cells were imaged on day 5\u20136.Microarray pathway enrichment analysisAll mRNA chips were normalized using GCRMA in Partek Genomic Suite (www.partek.com). The data after normalization were subjected to pathway analysis using a Sample-Level Enrichment-Based Pathway Ranking (SLEPR) method.All the described procedures for the SLEPR method are part of the WPS program and can be downloaded from WPS website (http://www.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/wps/wps_index.php). The inclusion of sample-level differentiated genes was performed using the two-sided MADe method. Computation of the enrichment scores for each sample-level differentiated gene using a Fisher\u2019s exact test was performed based on a 2 \u00d7 2 contingency table, and all results were ranked based on the P-value. To determine the statistical significance of the ranking for the gene, a permutation P-value was calculated from 103 permutations. The false discovery rates (FDR) q values were also computed from permutated data.WNT10B immunodepletion and western blotting10 \u03bcg of anti-WNT10B antibody (H-70, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) or control rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz) were added to 1.5 ml serum-free CM and rotated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The immune complexes were collected with 40 \u03bcl of A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After centrifugation, another 40 \u03bcl aliquot of A/G beads was incubated with the supernatant for 1 h, followed by centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was tested in the transwell migration assay.Western blotting was carried out as described. The membrane was probed with anti-WNT10B antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-\u03b2-actin antibody (Sigma).WNT10B 3\u2032-UTR luciferase reporter assay105 HeLa cells were first transfected with miR-148 mimic (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO, USA) or non-silencing control using HiPerfect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Final concentration of microRNA was 50 nM. Next day, cells were transfected with 0.2 \u03bcg of luciferase reporter vector and 0.1 \u03bcg of pCMV-lacZ using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). After 24 h, cells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer and 20 \u03bcl were used to measure luciferase activity with Luciferase Assay System (Promega Corporation) and 50 \u03bcl were used to measure \u03b2-galactosidase activity with the \u03b2-Gal Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The assay was performed in triplicate and repeated three times.SuperTOPFIash reporter assayA total of 105 fibroblasts were seeded in 12-well plates and, next day, transfected with 0.2 \u03bcg of pSuperTOPFIash or pSuperFOPFIash and 0.05 \u03bcg RL-TK, using Effectene reagent (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Dual luciferase Assay (Promega Corporation) was performed after 48 h. Alternatively, 105 CAFs with stable lentiviral expression of miR-148a or vector control were electroporated with 0.3 \u03bcg of pSuperTOPFIash and 0.1 \u03bcg of pRL-TK using Neon Transfection system (Invitrogen). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed, resuspended in R-buffer, mixed with DNA and electroporated in 10 \u03bcl tip with 2 pulses at 1400v and pulse width 20 ms. All transfections were performed in triplicate.\u03b2-Catenin stabilization assayA total of 0.5 \u00d7 106 ACI-158 cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates. Next day, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium to reduce the background levels of endogenous \u03b2-catenin. After 20\u201324 h, cells were pre-incubated with 1 \u03bcg/ml DKK1 (R&D Systems) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and then treated for 3 h with equal volume of control medium vs. CAF CM or Wnt3a CM. For sFRP1 treatment, CAF CM or Wnt3a CM was pre-incubated with 10 \u03bcg/ml of purified recombinant sFRP1 protein, at 4\u00b0C, for 30 min, and then added to serum-starved ACI-158 cells for 3h. \u03b2-catenin was precipitated with GST-E cadherin and detected as previously described.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis for transwell migration experiments was performed with GraphPad Prism5 software that showed mean values with 95% confidence interval. The P-values were calculated using Student\u2019s two-tailed t-test. The TaqMan data were obtained using \u0394\u0394Ct method and presented as mean fold change \u00b1 s.e.m.Supplementary Material           CONFLICT OF INTEREST         The authors declare no conflict

Based on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2), breast cancers can be categorized into five different molecular subtypes and each subtype has its own characteristics in the clinicopathological features, therapeutic methods and prognosis. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is denoted by negative expression of ER, PR and HER2, constitute a heterogeneous group of breast cancers that largely coincide with the basal-like subtype. With heterogeneity and uncharacterized molecular pathways, TNBC has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its highly metastatic potential, poor prognosis and insensitive to hormonal or targeted therapy.The aggressive behavior of TNBC cells is closely dependent on the tumor microenvironment. The fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are the predominant stromal cell type in tumor microenvironment. CAFs are distinct from fibroblasts in their expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and are known to play a critical role in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and treatment resistance. Several studies demonstrated that high activation of fibroblasts was associated with poor outcome in various tumors.Aside from CAFs, macrophages are also abundant in the tumor stroma at all stages of tumor progression and are known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Clinicopathological studies have demonstrated that high infiltration of CD163-positive TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including patients with TNBC.Accumulating researches have shown that CAFs and TAMs are synergistically related with cancer progression and prognosis of patients. However, the precise mechanisms driving the interaction and cross-talk between these cells remain unclarified. We speculated that CAFs might induce TAMs infiltration and consequently promote TNBC metastasis. In our study, we examined the correlation of CAFs and TAMs in TNBC, and analyzed their associations with clinicopathological features including lymph node metastasis and prognosis.Materials and methodsPatients and SpecimensThis study included 278 female TNBC patients (the lack of ER, PR and HER2 expression) without evidence of distant metastasis at the time of operation. Tissue samples were obtained from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Jiangsu Cancer Hospital. All specimens were pathologically reassessed independently by two breast pathologists according to the 7th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of Breast Cancer. None of these 278 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy before operation.Ethics statementThis retrospective study protocol was approved by the clinical research ethics committee of both hospitals, and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all participants or relatives.Immunohistochemical StainingAll the tissues specimens (4-\u03bcm-thick) were fixed in neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Tissue sections were placed on charged glass slides, and then were subjected to deparaffinization in xylene and rehydration in a graded series of ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer at pH 6.0. Specimens were incubated with the antibodies against CAFs markers, and CD163 overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed in PBS for 10 min. Information on antibodies was listed in Table 1.The streptavidin-peroxidase technique (SP-9001 Golden Bridge Int, Beijing, China) was used. An irrelevant rabbit anti-serum served as a negative control. The slides were stained with 3-3'-diamino-benzidine solution followed by counter-staining with hematoxylin.Evaluation of immunohistochemistryAll the slides were evaluated by two independent pathologists (X.Y.X. and S.Q.) who were blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics with consensus. All immunohistochemical markers were assessed via light microscopy (Carl Zeiss microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). The expression levels of each marker in cancer cells, stromal fibroblasts and macrophages were independently evaluated. Immunohistochemistry data were evaluated as \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d expression, regarding the rate of positive cells for each sample and each marker as previously described.Statistical analysisAll the data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows version 17.0. The correlation between \u03b1-SMA, FAP and CD163 and clinicopathological features was analyzed by the chi-square test. The association of the expression level of CD163 with the activation of CAFs was analyzed by the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient. The disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were the designated end-points. DFS was defined as the time from surgery to any local, regional, or distant disease; diagnosis of a second cancer other than breast cancer; or death from any cause. DSS was defined as the time period usually begins at the time of diagnosis of breast cancer or at the start of treatment and ends at the time of death. Patients who died from causes other than breast cancer are not counted in this measurement. All outcome results were reported as of May 31, 2016. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared by log-rank test. DFS and OS rate curves were calculated through the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analyses were analyzed by the Cox regression model. The p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.ResultsExpressions of CAFs and TAMs markers in cancer tissues with clinicopathological features in TNBCThe relationship between expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers and clinicopathological features of TNBC patients were described in Table 2. The study included 278 women, ranging from 20 to 84 years of age (mean, 57.8 years). More than half of the patients presented positive with lymph node (LN) (55.8%, 155/278), and patients presented with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) were 37.8% (105/278). Most cancers were larger than 2 cm. As for histologic grade, more than two-thirds (68.0%, 189/278) of cases were grade 3. Ductal breast cancer was the predominant type, accounting for 94.6% (263/278).The expressions of CAFs and TAMs markers were found predominantly in stromal cells and slightly in cancer cells in TNBC tissues. In stromal fibroblasts adjacent to cancer nests, \u03b1-SMA was reflected as brown cytoplasmic staining, and FAP was expressed on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. CD163 was detected on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm of the macrophages both in tumor nests and stroma. High and low expressions of the above-mentioned proteins, according to typical IHC staining patterns, in breast cancer tissues were shown in Figure 1. Of the 278 patients, high expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP, were detected in 50.4% (140/278) and 52.5% (146/278) patients of TNBC, respectively. The high expression rates of \u03b1-SMA (59.4%, 101/170) and FAP (63.5%, 108/170) in patients with recurrence were significantly higher than that without recurrence (P<0.001, respectively). The expressions of CAFs markers were also significantly correlated to the histological grade and aggressive behaviors of TNBC. High expressions of TAMs marker CD163, observed around the tumor nests in 148 cases (53.2%), was closely related to the aggressive behaviors, such as advanced TNM stage, nodal metastasis, LVI and so on.Association of Expressions of CAFs Markers with Infiltration of TAMs and Lymphatic MetastasisThe relationship between expressions of CAFs markers and CD163 were counted and has been described in Table 3. It was noted that expressions of CAFs markers in the 278 TNBC tissues were 50.4% for \u03b1-SMA and 52.5% for FAP. High infiltration of TAMs in neoplastic cells was also found in more than half cases. In overall patients, high infiltration of CAFs (\u03b1-SMA and FAP as markers) was significantly correlated with high infiltration of TAMs surrounding the cancer nests in TNBC tissues. As for recurrent cases, we found almost the similar results. In the same samples, we also found that high activation of CAFs was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (Table 4).Combined High Activation of CAFs with High Infiltration of TAMs was Associated with Poor Prognosis for TNBC patientsThe follow-up time ranged from 8 to 130 months (median 87 months) and ended at May 31, 2016. When the follow-up was over, 197 patients were alive, including 90 cases without and 107 cases with recurrence, while the remaining 81 cases were dead (12 died of other accompanied diseases and 69 died due to tumor relapse).Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The mean survival time was 69.42\u00b119.68 months for all cases, and the 5-year DFS and DSS were 79.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Compared with those with low expressions of CAFs markers, patients with high expressions had a disadvantageous DFS and DSS (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that elevated activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors for DFS and OS rates in TNBC patients (P<0.05) (Fig. 2A-B, Table 5).DiscussionIn this study, we selected a cohort of 278 patients in order to analyze whether CAFs correlated with TAMs infiltration, lymphatic metastasis and could predict outcome for TNBC patients. The results of the present study supported the speculation that high activation of CAFs correlates with infiltration of TAMs, lymph node metastasis and contributes to poor prognosis in TNBC. The results also demonstrated that age (45.6 vs. 54.4%), histological type and menopausal status (54.4 vs. 45.6%) did not significantly affect the activation of CAFs and infiltration of TAMs. In the present study, we found that patients with aggressive features such as lymph node metastasis, large size, and high histological grade possessed with high expression of CAFs markers and elevated of TAMs infiltration. In addition, CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis.In the current study, we also manifested that CAFs markers significantly correlated with CD163 expression and lymph node metastasis, especially for those with recurrence. The combination of CAFs and TAMs within a tumor site has been reported to be a potential prognostic factor in multiple solid cancers, such as oral cancer, neuroblastoma and colorectal cancer patients. In the present study, Multivariate Cox showed that activation of CAFs, high TAMs infiltration and lymphatic metastasis were independent worse prognostic factors in TNBC patients.In breast cancer, CAFs are key players in the tumor microenvironment since they not only promote tumorigenesis, cancer evolution and therapeutic resistance, and targeting CAFs would provide a novel strategy for anti-cancer treatment. Recently, accumulating researches have focused on the role of CAFs in TNBC. Increased collagen expression in tumors is associated with increased risk of metastasis, and TNBC has the highest propensity to develop distant metastases when there is evidence of central fibrosis. CAFs can regulate TGF-\u03b2 ligands to promote accumulation of fibrosis and cancer progression. By targeting the CAFs with Pirfenidone (PFD) in combination with doxorubicin, could inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis synergistically. Hu C et al. Shown that regulating CAFs with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel could potentiate the effect of chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis TNBC. The study conducted by Wang M et al. demonstrated that CAFs autophagy can enhance TNBC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, and induce EMT process through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway.In this retrospective study, our results suggest that CAFs were correlated with TAMs infiltration in patients with TNBC. High expressions of \u03b1-SMA and FAP were correlated with elevated expression of CD163, and CAFs might play an important role in shaping the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by regulating protumoral phenotype of TAMs. However, the exact mechanism of CAFs polarize macrophage is not yet clarified in TNBC. The research conducted by Kumar V et al. has demonstrated that CAFs are major sources of chemokines that can recruit and induce PMN-MDSC infiltration to neutralize the anti-tumor effect of CSF1 receptor blockade to eliminate TAMs. Crosstalk between stromal components and TNBC cells could enhance TNBC tumor growth and metastatic extravasation and colonization, and the IL-8-CXCR1/2 signaling acts as a key regulator orchestrating TNBC metastatic breast cancer via TNBC crosstalk with CAFs and TAMs. The findings of Tashireva LA et al. has shown the heterogeneous distribution of fibroblasts and macrophages in breast tumor microenvironment and its close relation to the intratumoral morphological diversity of BC and contribution to lymph node metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs could promote an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment through the induction and accumulation of protumoral macrophages via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1. In turn, TAMs can affect collagenous matrix remodeling through their regulation of collagen production by CAFs and induce myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, due to the enrichment in reactive CAFs and M2-like macrophages in TNBC stromal, the crosstalk between CAFs and TAMs might be a potentially novel target in ameliorating the pro-tumorigenic microenvironment.Our data show that CAFs activation correlated with TAMs infiltration and lymph node metastasis, and there may be exist a fascinating loop among CAFs, TAMs and cancer cells, in which the interaction between stromal and cancer cells allows for the establishment of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment to promote cancer progress. In keeping with our findings and these reports, the combination of TAMs and CAFs could be a potential prognostic factor and also a potential therapeutic target in TNBC.Cancer statistics in China, 2015Basal-like and triple-negative breast cancers: a critical review with an emphasis on the implications for pathologists and oncologistsTriple-negative/basal-like breast cancer: reviewTriple-negative breast cancer: challenges and opportunities of a heterogeneous diseaseComparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast CancerClinicopathological features and prognostic evaluation of bone metastasis in triple-negative breast cancerCancer-associated fibroblasts: a multifaceted driver of breast cancer progressionThe role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in breast cancer pathobiologyBreast cancer-associated fibroblasts induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cellsHigh infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasisTumor-associated macrophages correlate with phenomenon of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and contribute to poor prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer patientsCancer-associated fibroblasts and CD163-positive macrophages in oral squamous cell carcinoma: their clinicopathological and prognostic significanceCancer-associated fibroblast and M2 macrophage markers together predict outcome in colorectal cancer patientsCollaboration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumour-associated macrophages for neuroblastoma developmentCancer-associated fibroblasts and M2-polarized macrophages synergize during prostate carcinoma progressionCancer-associated fibroblasts promote M2 polarization of macrophages in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaTransforming growth factor-\u03b21 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin in stromal fibroblasts are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage I-IIIA nonsmall cell lung cancer after curative resectionRole of stromal myofibroblasts in invasive breast cancer: stromal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin correlates with worse clinical outcomeFibroblast activation protein expression by stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages in human breast cancerFibroblast activation protein and its prognostic significance in correlation with vascular endothelial growth factor in pancreatic adenocarcinomaCD10+GPR77+ Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Promote Cancer Formation and Chemoresistance by Sustaining Cancer StemnessTargeting the cancer-associated fibroblasts as a treatment in triple-negative breast cancerRegulating cancer associated fibroblasts with losartan-loaded injectable peptide hydrogel to potentiate chemotherapy in inhibiting growth and lung metastasis of triple negative breast cancerCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer CellsCancer-Associated Fibroblasts Neutralize the Anti-tumor Effect of CSF1 Receptor Blockade by Inducing PMN-MDSC Infiltration of TumorsCrosstalk between stromal components and tumor cells of TNBC via secreted factors enhances tumor growth and metastasisIntratumoral heterogeneity of macrophages and fibroblasts in breast cancer is associated with the morphological diversity of tumor cells and contributes to lymph node metastasisFibroblasts drive an immunosuppressive and growth-promoting microenvironment in breast cancer via secretion of Chitinase 3-like 1Tumor macrophages are pivotal constructors of tumor collagenous matrixTumor-Associated Macrophages Promote Malignant Progression of Breast Phyllodes Tumors by Inducing Myofibroblast DifferentiationDetection of CAFs activation ( \u03b1-SMA and FAP ) and TAMs infiltration ( marker CD163 ) in TNBC tissue by IHC.

Understanding the full repertoire of CAFs and their dynamic changes as tumors evolve could improve the precision of cancer treatment. Here we comprehensively analyze CAFs using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting at several time points along breast tumor progression in mice, uncovering distinct subpopulations. Notably, the transcriptional programs of these subpopulations change over time and in metastases, transitioning from an immunoregulatory program to wound-healing and antigen-presentation programs, indicating that CAFs and their functions are dynamic. Two main CAF subpopulations are also found in human breast tumors, where their ratio is associated with disease outcome across subtypes and is particularly correlated with BRCA mutations in triple-negative breast cancer. These findings indicate that the repertoire of CAF changes over time in breast cancer progression, with direct clinical implications.",

Recently, we revealed that fibroblasts secrete exosomes that promote breast cancer cell (BCC) protrusive activity, motility, and metastasis by activating autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling in BCCs. Moreover, we showed that Wnt ligands produced by BCCs tether to fibroblast exosomes upon trafficking of exosomes in BCCs.

Metastasis is a complex multi-step process, with cells undergoing metabolic reprograming to support their energetic, biosynthetic, and redox needs at various stages of metastasis. During invasion, metabolic adaptation also enables cancer cells to survive in nutrient-limited environments. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process where epithelial cancer cells acquire mesenchymal features, plays an important role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. EMT is regulated by several transcription factors, which control, among others, numerous metabolic genes.One of the key metabolic branches in the cell is the network of folate-dependent biochemical pathways. Folate (vitamin B9) functions as a coenzyme in numerous reactions of one-carbon transfer, which are involved in nucleotide biosynthesis, amino acid metabolism, redox homeostasis, and epigenetic regulation. Since humans cannot synthesize folate, folate metabolism is regulated to a significant extent by dietary intake of the vitamin. Low folate intake or status has been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases, most notably neural tube defects, but also particular forms of cancer. In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mandatory fortification of several types of grain foods in the US with folic acid, a synthetic form of the vitamin, to prevent neural tube defects.Replenishing the intracellular folate pool by the intake of exogenous folates, such as folic acid, is especially important for rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells. Ample preclinical evidence links cellular replication to folate availability. Such a link raised the concern that excessive consumption of dietary folate or folic acid may promote the progression of neoplastic lesions and increase the risk of malignancies and cancer-related death. In support of such concern, animal studies have demonstrated that high intake of folic acid promotes the progression of established tumors. A similar conclusion has been drawn based on the observed association between serum folate levels and proliferation of cancer cells in men with prostate cancer. Of note, while additional studies support this conclusion, other studies have shown inverse associations between dietary folate and tumor development. Nevertheless, the possibility that excessive intake of folates might promote development of malignancies should not be ignored.The role of folate in cancer metastasis is even less clear and the literature on this subject is limited and somewhat controversial. Low extracellular folate is associated with altered expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, migration and invasion indicating that the vitamin might play a role in the mechanism of metastasis. Of note, the positive association between folic acid supplementation and the migratory ability of cancer cells, as well as the inhibitory effects of antifolates on cell migration, have been demonstrated. In further support of the role of folate metabolism in metastasis, metastasizing melanomas have been shown to have increased dependence on NADPH-generating folate pathways. Also, antifolate pemetrexed has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Several studies, however, suggested that folate supplementation would inhibit rather than promote metastasis. For example, a recent report has demonstrated that in cultured cells folate deficiency causes the elevation of reactive oxygen species, which leads to the suppression of proliferation, but at the same time enhances metastatic potential. In agreement with these findings, folate deficiency promoted metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. In another study, folate deprivation enhanced invasiveness of colon cancer cells through the activation of sonic hedgehog and NF-\u03baB signaling. Inhibitory effects of folic acid on metastasis and proliferation have been also linked to the activation of the folate receptor-ERK1/2-TSLC1 signaling pathway. Contrary to these studies, we have previously reported that folate deprivation inhibits migration and invasion of cultured cancer cells and decreases tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse model.In a recent study, we have shown that folic acid restriction led to metabolic reprogramming and a less aggressive phenotype in cultured murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Specifically, cells kept on folic acid-free medium displayed reduced migration and had weaker invasion potential. Interestingly, effects of folic acid withdrawal were more profound in more tumorigenic mesenchymal cells than in epithelial cells. To obtain insight into potential mechanisms related to folate restriction, in the present study we have evaluated transcriptomic profiles in three mouse TNBC cell lines grown in medium with or without folic acid.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell linesEpithelial (E-Wnt) and mesenchymal (M-Wnt) cells were each derived from the same pool of mammary tumors from mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt-1 transgenic mice. Spontaneous mammary tumors were excised, dissected and mechanically dissociated, and viable cells were plated. Based on morphology, specific clones with epithelial and mesenchymal properties were selected, further characterized and eventually denoted as E-Wnt and M-Wnt cells, respectively. Metastatic metM-Wntliver cells were derived from a liver metastasis following orthotopic transplant of M-Wnt cells in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. All cell lines were tested for species verification, karyotyping, and genomic instability and were authenticated by the Molecular Cytogenetics Core facility at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX).Cell culture experimentsE-Wnt, M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells were cultured in 10-cm plates for 72 hours using either standard RPMI 1640 medium (containing 2.2 \u03bcM folic acid) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or RPMI 1640 medium without folic acid with dialyzed FBS. Media were purchased from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA and FBS came from Atlanta Biologicals (Flowery Branch, GA).RNA isolation and microarraysTotal RNA was extracted from three samples (biological replicates) per cellular subtype using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Complementary RNA (cRNA) was generated using a Low Input Quick Amp labeling kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with NIH3T3 cells as reference RNA. Gene expression microarrays were processed by the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Genomics Core (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) as previously described. A total of 18 samples were hybridized to custom two-color 180K Agilent microarrays (BARCODE25503) and scanned using an Agilent Technologies Scanner G2505C with Feature Extraction software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Microarray data were submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository with number GSE148738.Microarray data analysisGene expression data were processed and analyzed using the limma package (3.38.3) in R (version 3.5.0). Background correction, within-array normalization using global loess normalization, and between-array quantile normalization were performed before further processing of the data. Positive (n=4254) and negative (n=594) control probes were filtered from the dataset. Probes with a low intensity (< the average signal of 75% of the negative control probes) were excluded from further analyses. The \u2018avereps\u2019 function was used to condense the dataset by taking the average of replicate probes, resulting in a final dataset consisting of 78,555 probes used for downstream analyses. The probes were annotated based on the annotation file available through GEO (platform GPL23453). Differentially expressed probes were identified across the cellular subtypes and between folic acid withdrawal and control conditions within each subtype. P-values were corrected for multiple testing by using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) approach. BH-adjusted P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Pathway analyses and upstream regulatory analyses were conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Qiagen Bioinformatics, Aarhus, Denmark). Additional gene ontology was determined using Enrichr. Integrative pathway analyses based on gene expression data as well as our previously reported metabolite data were performed using the joined pathway module in MetaboAnalyst. For each of the cellular subtypes, the top 100 probes (based on lowest P-values) were analyzed together with the metabolites that were altered upon folic acid withdrawal (n=12 for E-Wnt, n=29 for M-Wnt and n=25 for metM-Wntliver). Hypergeometric testing was applied for the pathway overrepresentation analyses (with corresponding natural log P-values) and pathway topology analyses (based on degree centrality) were quantified using pathway impact values.RESULTSEffects of folic acid withdrawal on transcriptomic profiles in mouse TNBC cell linesWe have previously demonstrated that folic acid withdrawal suppresses proliferation and motility, while promoting metabolic reprogramming, in E-Wnt, M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells. Herein, we have determined the transcriptional response of these cells following withdrawal of folic acid. Based on the top 500 probes with most variable gene expression, the epithelial cells (E-Wnt) showed expression profiles distinct from the mesenchymal cells (M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver). Additionally, the M-Wnt cells clustered according to the presence or absence of folic acid in the culture medium (Figure 1A).Upon folic acid withdrawal, differential expression was found for 108, 1884 and 222 genes in the E-Wnt, M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells, respectively (BH-adjusted P-value <0.05) (Figure 1B). For four genes (Egr2, Oasl1, Rsad2 and Khdrbs3), differential expression upon folic acid withdrawal was found in all cellular subtypes (Figure 1C). The direction of gene expression changes, however, differed. Expression of Egr2 and Khdrbs3 was upregulated after folic acid withdrawal in M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells and downregulated in E-Wnt cells. For Oasl1 and Rsad2, expression was downregulated in the E-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells and upregulated in the M-Wnt cells. Further exploration of the Venn diagram showed that the majority of the differentially expressed genes was unique for one of the respective cellular subtypes, with some additional overlap (n=92 overlapping genes) found for the M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells. These overlapping genes were enriched for the type I interferon signaling pathway (Gene Ontology Biological Process 2018: GO 0060337, q-value 2.8E-09). Based on Volcano plots, it was confirmed that the most pronounced effects on gene expression profiles (in terms of both fold changes and statistical significance) were found for M-Wnt cells as compared to the two other subtypes (Figures 1D\u2013F).Expression of interferon signaling genes was differentially regulated upon folic acid withdrawalIngenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the affected pathways upon folic acid withdrawal (compared to control conditions) in M-Wnt cells were predominantly related to (innate) immune responses, and inflammation (Figure 2A). Lipopolysaccharide and various interferon-related factors, such as Irf7, Ifna2, Ifnl1, Irf3 were identified as potential upstream regulators responsible for the observed differences in gene expression upon folic acid withdrawal in the M-Wnt cells (Table 1). All of these pathways and upstream regulators were predicted to be activated, indicating activation of type I interferon signaling, in response to folic acid withdrawal in the MWnt cells.For the E-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells, pathway analyses also indicated that expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses as well as cell death regulation was affected by folic acid withdrawal (Figure 2A). For the immune-, and specifically interferon-related pathways, the activation patterns upon folic acid withdrawal were largely opposite to the effects observed for M-Wnt cells. Further exploration of the transcriptomic data for several individual genes (Irf7, Irf9, Stat1, Stat2) involved in these pathways demonstrated that M-Wnt cells already had lower expression of these genes under control conditions as compared to E-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells (Figure 2B). Expression of these genes, however, was consistently upregulated upon folic acid withdrawal in M-Wnt cells, whereas it was unchanged or downregulated in E-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells, respectively (Figure 2C). To further explore the observation that expression of interferon-related genes was repressed in mesenchymal cells and might be restored by folic acid withdrawal, we examined a previously established interferon-responsive gene signature. The gene signature showed that expression of the majority of the interferon-responsive genes was suppressed in M-Wnt cells compared to E-Wnt and metMWntliver cells. M-Wnt cells cultured in folic acid-free medium showed profound recovery of interferon-responsive gene expression, with log2 fold changes up to 4.8 (Figure 3).Folic acid withdrawal did not substantially affect expression of markers for epithelialto-mesenchymal transition in mouse TNBC cell linesEMT has long been viewed as an important step in the acquisition of invasive and metastatic traits in a variety of cancer types. In the present study, we observed that under control conditions (folic acid-competent medium), the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Cdh1) was strongly expressed in epithelial (E-Wnt) cells (Figure 4A), which is in line with previously reported findings in these cell lines. The mesenchymal markers vimentin (Vim) and fibronectin (Fn1) showed higher expression in the mesenchymal (M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver) cells as compared to the epithelial cells. Also transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1) and the zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox factors (Zeb1 and Zeb2) as well as the basic helix-loop-helix factors (Twist1 and Twist2), involved in induction of EMT, were predominantly expressed in the mesenchymal cells. The subtype-specific patterns were less pronounced for the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin (Cdh2), which showed low expression in all cells (relative to the reference NIH3T3 cells). Withdrawal of folic acid from the medium did not result in substantial expression changes for this panel of EMT-related genes (BH-adjusted P-value > 0.05 and log2 fold changes <1) (Figure 4B).Integrative pathway analysesWe have also performed an explorative joint pathway analysis, which allowed the integration of transcriptomic data with our previous data on metabolite profiling. This analysis indicated that diverse metabolic pathways were affected by folic acid withdrawal (Figure 5). Based on a false-discovery rate (FDR) P-value <0.05, 1, 37 and 19 pathways were identified for E-Wnt, M-Wnt, and metM-Wntliver cells, respectively. The only pathway identified in E-Wnt cells, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, was also among the identified pathways in the M-Wnt and metM-Wntliver cells (Supplementary Table 1). All pathways identified in metMWntliver cells were also found for M-Wnt cells, with the exception of pyruvate metabolism and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly, pathways uniquely found in M-Wnt cells and not matched with metabolites, were relevant to host response to pathogens, with all identified pathways having links to interferon signaling (Supplementary Table 1). It should be noted that in the present study the application of this approach is rather exploratory due to the limited number of metabolites (n=41) available from our previously published study.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONSFolate is known to play an important role in human health and disease due to its participation in diverse metabolic pathways as well as in the regulation of methylation reactions. Pleiotropic effects of folate in cancer cells have been linked to migratory capacity and invasiveness; though effects may differ by cancer type, stage and molecular subtype. We have previously shown that folic acid withdrawal resulted in metabolic and bioenergetic changes indicative of a less proliferative as well as less migratory phenotype in mouse TNBC cell lines. Here we report that transcriptomic profiles of mouse TNBC cell lines possessing a mesenchymal phenotype were more responsive to withdrawal of folic acid than TNBC cells with an epithelial phenotype. These findings are in agreement with our previous work showing that effects on metabolite levels in response to folic acid withdrawal were generally stronger in mesenchymal than epithelial TNBC cells. The transcriptomic effects were also less pronounced in cells derived from liver metastases compared to the parental mesenchymal cell line.Mesenchymal cells with characteristic traits acquired during EMT are considered crucial for malignant progression of many cancer types including TNBC. We studied the effects of folic acid withdrawal across EMT states in mouse TNBC cell lines that share the same genetic background, but differ in terms of molecular characteristics and metastatic potential in addition to cellular phenotype. We observed that expression of a panel of genes directly involved in EMT did not substantially change upon folic acid withdrawal in any of the TNBC subtypes. Rather, we identified interferon signaling as one of the top pathways affected by folic acid withdrawal in M-Wnt cells. Of note, three out of four genes (Egr2, Oasl1 and Rsad2) affected by folic acid withdrawal in all three studied cell lines are relevant to interferon pathways and immunity. Interestingly, it has been reported that human TNBC cells are characterized by repressed interferon signaling; the phenomenon specific for TNBC cells with mesenchymal, in contrast to epithelial, morphology. Treatment of mesenchymal TNBC cells with interferon-\u03b2 repressed mesenchymal properties and inhibited migration. Remarkably, the reported change in the expression pattern of interferon signaling pathway genes in response to the sustained interferon-\u03b2 exposure was almost identical to such a pattern in M-Wnt cells in response to folic acid withdrawal in our study. Furthermore, exploratory joint pathway analysis, based on our transcriptomic and metabolite data, identified several pathways linked to interferon signaling in M-Wnt cells only. The top pathway from this analysis was JAK-STAT signaling, which has a role in both breast cancer etiology and interferon response. Another pathway in the list, NOD-like receptor signaling, has been linked to the STAT-JAK pathway as well as to interferon signaling. Additional pathways identified for M-Wnt cells were host-pathogen interactions and thus also directly relevant to interferon signaling.The putative link between folate metabolism and interferon signaling as well as other indicators of (innate) immune responses have been described before in cell culture as well as in animal and human studies. High-dose folic acid supplementation or high circulating levels of folic acid in healthy young individuals as well as in obese post-menopausal women were associated with reduced numbers and cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and altered expression profiles of cytokines. Exposure of human colonic cell lines to increasing doses of folic acid resulted in altered expression of inflammatory mediators, with effects differing for non-malignant and malignant cell lines. The relationship between high folic acid intake and reduced natural killer cell cytotoxicity was also confirmed in murine studies and was, at least partially, attributed to reduced interleukin (IL)-10 production with excess folic acid. Our observation that folic acid withdrawal might reactivate interferon signaling in mesenchymal TNBC cells is of particular interest from a clinical perspective since such reactivation has been considered a promising therapeutic target. TNBC cells characterized by active INF / STAT signaling are viewed as \u2018hot\u2019 tumors that show prognostic benefits over TNBC subtypes with immune-repressed traits (\u2018cold\u2019 tumors). Transformation of TNBC from \u2018cold\u2019 to \u2018hot\u2019 tumors, may therefore provide a window of opportunity for targeted and immune-based therapies.Towards this end, our data suggest that folate restriction might contribute to such therapeutically beneficial transformation. Therefore, traditional chemotherapeutics targeting folate metabolism could be a possible (additional) treatment option for specific TNBC subtypes. Indeed, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil in combination with cyclophosphamide have been commonly used for the treatment of TNBC. The new generation antifolate pemetrexed has been in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced breast cancer as well. In general, the drug has shown strong activity with acceptable toxicities for treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients. Yet, resistance to antifolates is a common phenomenon making them largely ineffective in cancer treatment. Multiple mechanisms underlie the development of antifolate resistance, including activation of the drug efflux processes. For tumors relaying on this mechanism, folate restriction removes the need to accumulate drugs in the cell and could directly disable important biosynthetic pathways by depriving cancer cells of important metabolites rather than by inhibiting corresponding enzymes. Moreover, antifolates might not be active in cells with sufficient levels of reduced folate to outcompete the action of drugs, as occurs under conditions of excess folate. It should be expected that the response to folate restriction will be cell-type specific and will be modulated depending on the gene signatures for a specific cell type. For example, thymidylate synthase expression predicts poor response to pemetrexed in patients with advanced breast cancer. Likewise, our study supports differential responses to folic acid restriction varying by EMT status, gene expression profiles and metastatic potential.These findings may thus provide a rationale to consider folate deprivation as a therapeutic option for TNBC, potentially in combination with other treatment strategies. Obviously, validation of our findings in human cell lines and cancer models is required and ultimately clinical studies are warranted. For example, safe limits of folate restriction as well as its efficacy towards specific cancer subtypes needs to be established; this calls for adaptation of personalized treatment strategies based on molecular subtype and folate status. Importantly, our study indicates a subtype-specific response to folic acid restriction. Perhaps the regulation of interferon signaling in TNBC could be cell type-specific as well. In support of this possibility, it has been shown that the interferon regulatory factor Irf7 was suppressed in tumor cells from a bone metastasis in the 4T1.2 mouse model, while this gene was highly expressed in metMWntliver cells in our study. Interestingly, restoration of Irf7 expression or administration of interferon-\u03b11 led to reduced metastasis rates to the spine and femur in the 4T1.2 mouse model, whereas the extent of metastasis to the lung was not reduced. This finding suggests additional, metastasis site-dependent, specificity of the interferon effect.Overall, our findings suggest that folic acid withdrawal affects gene expression in a mouse cell model of TNBC, with most pronounced effects in cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. These cells revealed repressed expression of genes representing the interferon signaling signature, and this effect was reversed upon folic acid withdrawal. Our research provides novel leads for further studies focusing on folate deprivation as a potential strategy to improve treatment responses, particularly in mesenchymal subtypes of TNBC.Supplementary MaterialThis is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.

        "content": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive and invasive type of breast cancer. In addition, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is recognized as a risk factor for cancer metastasis, which is associated with mortality in patients with breast cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) generated from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) play a vital role in the progression of TNBC. However, to date, whether T2DM affects the ability of AT-MSCs to differentiate into CAFs is still unclear. In this study, we found that in coculture with TNBC cells [breast cancer cells (BCCs)] under hypoxic conditions, AT-MSCs derived from T2DM donors (dAT-MSCs) were facilitated to differentiate into CAFs, which showed fibroblastic morphology and the induced expression of fibroblastic markers, such as fibroblast activation protein, fibroblast-specific protein, and vimentin. This was involved in the higher expression of transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGF\u03b2R2) and the phosphorylation of Smad2/3. Furthermore, T2DM affected the fate and functions of CAFs derived from dAT-MSCs. While CAFs derived from AT-MSCs of healthy donors (AT-CAFs) exhibited the markers of inflammatory CAFs, those derived from dAT-MSCs (dAT-CAFs) showed the markers of myofibroblastic CAFs. Of note, in comparison with AT-CAFs, dAT-CAFs showed a higher ability to induce the proliferation and in vivo metastasis of BCCs, which was involved in the activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2)-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggests that T2DM contributes to metastasis of BCCs by inducing the myofibroblastic CAFs differentiation of dAT-MSCs. In addition, targeting the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in dAT-MSCs may be useful in cancer therapy for TNBC patients with T2DM.",

        "content": "Loss of Wnt-5a protein expression is associated with shorter recurrence-free survival in breast carcinoma patients and increased motility in mammary cell lines. Based on sequence analysis of Wnt-5a, we identified 14 peptide fragments and investigated their ability to mimic the effects of Wnt-5a on mammary cell adhesion and migration. Two of these peptides significantly increased adhesion and impaired migration in the non-tumorigenic HB2 breast epithelial cell line and in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line, both of which show little endogenous expression of the Wnt-5a protein. We removed two amino acids at a time from the N terminus of the shorter of these two peptides to identify the shortest peptide that still inhibited migration. The influence on tumor cell adhesion was gradually lost and was no longer detectable when only six amino acids remained. However, formylation of the N-terminal methionine of this hexapeptide restored its effect on adhesion and reduced tumor cell motility via a Frizzled-5 receptor-dependent mechanism, even at a low pH such as encountered in breast tumor tissue. This formylated hexapeptide ligand induced a rapid cytosolic calcium signal, whereas it did not affect the cellular levels of unphosphorylated beta-catenin or active JNK. The novel formyl-Met-Asp-Gly-Cys-Glu-Leu peptide ligand is not only a valuable experimental tool but has also a potential role in antimetastatic treatment of the 50% of human breast cancer patients that have reduced endogenous Wnt-5a protein expression.",

However, the ability of WNT5A to inhibit breast cancer cell migration and invasion is an EMT-independent mechanism that, at least in part, can be explained by decreased CD44 expression.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13046-016-0421-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.BackgroundThe Wnt family of proteins includes secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins that regulate diverse cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration. To date, 19 members of the Wnt gene family have been identified and placed into three different classes based on their transforming potential. WNT5A belongs to the non-transforming class and elicits non-canonical (\u03b2-catenin-independent) signaling upon binding to different receptors or co-receptor complexes (Frizzled, RYK, ROR1/2, LRP5/6 and CD146).WNT5A signaling has been shown to be essential for normal development. In the context of mammary gland development, WNT5A signaling plays an important role in ductal branching, and its loss can induce increased ductal extensions and larger terminal buds. These findings suggest that WNT5A functions to limit mammary epithelial cell migration during development.The loss of WNT5A signaling plays an important role in breast cancer progression, thereby making WNT5A a tumor suppressor. Moreover, the loss of WNT5A protein in breast cancer patients has been associated with poor prognosis, early recurrence and reduced overall survival. Using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Borcherding et al. reported strong WNT5A expression in normal mammary ducts and acini, but reduced WNT5A expression was observed in 75\u00a0% of triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Accordingly, a recent study by Zhong et al. demonstrated a loss of WNT5A in 60\u00a0% of TNBC patients, and this loss positively correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additionally, we have also demonstrated that WNT5A expression can be used as a potential prognostic biomarker in pre-menopausal patients with ER+ breast tumors. Other studies of breast cancer cells involving the treatment of cells with either recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A) or the stable transfection of WNT5A protein demonstrated that breast cancer cell adhesion increased, whereas their migration decreased.A key biological event responsible for tumor cell invasion and metastasis is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cancer cells undergoing EMT show a loss of cell-cell contact and polarity and acquire migratory and invasive properties. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of WNT5A in the regulation of the EMT. In colon cancer, where WNT5A acts as a tumor suppressor, WNT5A restoration has been shown to inhibit EMT by antagonizing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. In a similar study, Cai et al. demonstrated that microRNA-374a directly suppresses multiple negative regulators of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, including WNT5A, and this suppression induces EMT in breast cancer. These studies also suggest that canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays a parallel role as a potential regulator of EMT in these cancers. In contrast, WNT5A has been shown to positively drive EMT-like changes in gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer and malignant melanomas, where WNT5A acts as a tumor promoter.The aim of the present study was to clarify whether the loss of WNT5A expression can induce an EMT phenotype to consequently increase the invasiveness of breast epithelial cells. Moreover, this study aimed to determine whether inhibition of such a mechanism could explain our previous observation that WNT5A can suppress the invasion of breast cancer cells. In the present study, we employed HB2 human mammary epithelial cells (which endogenously express WNT5A) as a model system to elucidate the early events associated with the loss of WNT5A protein and EMT changes. However, we also examined whether WNT5A inhibits breast cancer cell migration/invasion via a reversal of EMT in breast cancer cells.MethodsCell linesThe human mammary epithelial cell line HB2, which is a subclone of the MTSV1-7 cell line, was kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr. J. Taylor Papadimitriou (ICRF, UK). HB2 cells are a suitable model to study mammary cell responses because they endogenously express WNT5A protein (mimicking the clinical situation; normal mammary epithelial cells and acini endogenously express WNT5A protein). Thus, the modulation of WNT5A expression can be directly investigated via phenotypic changes and changes in the expression of biomarkers/molecules of interest in these cells. The human mammary carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB468 (Lot No. 60880170) and MDA-MB231 (Lot No. 61093072) were procured directly from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were grown in DMEM (Hyclone, UT, USA) supplemented with 10\u00a0% FBS, 5 U/ml penicillin, 0.5 U/ml streptomycin, and 2\u00a0mM glutamine. The growth media for HB2 cells was also supplemented with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml bovine insulin and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone. The cell lines were frequently screened for mycoplasma contamination using an EZ-PCR kit (HaEmek, Israel).siRNA transfectionsSequence-specific siRNAs were used to transiently knock down WNT5A, E-cadherin and CD44. We purchased Silencer\u00ae select pre-designed siRNAs for WNT5A [ID: s14871 (siRNA 1) and ID: s14872 (siRNA 2)], E-cadherin (ID: 146381) and negative control #1 siRNA from Applied Biosystems (CA, USA). SMARTpool CD44 siRNA (h) (Cat. no. sc-29342) was procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (TX, USA). Briefly, cells were transiently transfected with a transfection complex consisting of 50 or 100 nM siRNA (final concentration) and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) suspended in serum-free DMEM. After 6\u00a0h, the transfection complex was removed, and the cells were replenished with fresh DMEM containing 10\u00a0% FBS. The cells were then allowed to grow for the next 48\u00a0h prior to being used for Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, or an invasion assay.Western blottingUntreated cells or cells treated with siRNAs, rWNT5A, or U0126 were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold phosphorylation lysis buffer (PLB). The estimation of protein concentration, SDS-PAGE and visualization procedures were performed as described in Prasad et al.. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-WNT5A from R & D Systems (MN, USA); anti-E-cadherin, anti-pAKT (ser473), anti-total AKT, anti-vimentin, anti-N-cadherin, anti-Slug and anti-pERK1/2 from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA); anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (TX, USA); and anti-CD44 (156-3C11) antibody from Thermo Scientific (CA, USA). The secondary antibodies used in this study were goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-goat, which were procured from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).Phase-contrast and confocal microscopyFor phase-contrast microscopy, HB2 cells were grown in 6-well culture plates or on glass coverslips and treated with either WNT5A siRNA or E-cadherin siRNA. For the negative control, cells were treated with scrambled siRNA. After 48\u00a0h, the HB2 cells were photographed (using a Nikon model TMS-F microscope) and analyzed with NIS-Elements software (Tokyo, Japan).For confocal microscopy, the cells were grown on 13-mm glass coverslips for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified incubator under 5\u00a0% CO2. For the rWNT5A rescue experiments, cells were transfected with WNT5A siRNA transfection for 48\u00a0h and subsequently treated with rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for another 24\u00a0h. For CD44 immunostaining of breast cancer cells stably expressing WNT5A protein (MDA-MB468-5A and MDA-MB231-5A), the cells were allowed to grow on 13-mm glass coverslips for 48\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified incubator under 5\u00a0% CO2 in reduced serum conditions. After the treatments, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4\u00a0% paraformaldehyde for 20\u00a0min and permeabilized using 0.1\u00a0% Triton X-100 for 3\u00a0min (all steps were performed at RT). Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (i.e., E-cadherin, vimentin or CD44) in a humidified chamber at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (either goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488) (Molecular Probes\u2122, Oregon, USA) for 45\u00a0min at room temperature. After extensive washing, the cells were counterstained with DAPI (300 nM in PBS) for 2\u00a0min. Next, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Dako fluorescent mounting medium and viewed with a Carl Zeiss LSM 700 (Oberkochen, Germany) confocal microscope. Immunofluorescence staining was semi-quantitatively assessed using ImageJ software (NIH, MD, USA). Briefly, the images were first processed using the process tool to sharpen the images, and plot profiles were generated utilizing a line cross-sectioning approach for each cell. The areas inside the peaks depicting membranous or cytoplasmic intensities were evaluated using the freehand selection and measurement tools. The resultant graphs reveal the mean fluorescence (a.u.) corresponding to the membranous or cytoplasmic staining of the protein in each cell.Transwell invasion and migration assaysWNT5A, E-cadherin or CD44 siRNA-transfected cells were washed and detached with Versene (Gibco\u00ae, NY, USA) and subsequently re-suspended as single-cell suspensions in low-serum DMEM (supplemented with 1\u00a0% FBS). The cell invasion assays were carried out in BD Matrigel\u2122 invasion chambers (MA, USA), and the cells were counted using an automated cell counter (Countess\u2122, Invitrogen, Korea). A total of 50,000 cells in low-serum DMEM were added to the upper chamber [for rWNT5A treatment, rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) was freshly added to the medium], and the lower chamber was filled with 0.7\u00a0ml of DMEM supplemented with 10\u00a0% FBS. The cells were allowed to invade for 24\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5\u00a0% CO2. After incubation, the cells in the insert were fixed with 4\u00a0% paraformaldehyde for 10\u00a0min at RT. The non-invading cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton-tipped applicator and further processed as described by Linnskog et al.. Transwell migration assays for CD44 siRNA-treated breast cancer cells were performed in a similar manner using a cell culture insert containing a PET membrane with an 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm pore size (Ref# 353097; Corning Incorporated, NY, USA).Wound healing assayThe migration of MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cells was analyzed using a wound-healing assay. A total of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates and grown either in the presence of rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or the vehicle control suspended in low-serum DMEM (supplemented with 1\u00a0% FBS) for 48\u00a0h. The rWNT5A was replenished every 24\u00a0h. Wounds were then created by scratching the monolayer, and the cells were subsequently allowed to migrate for 24\u00a0h under the same media conditions. The wounds were photographed at 10X magnification with a Nikon microscope (Model: TMS-F) immediately after wounding and 72\u00a0h after wounding. The images were compared and analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH, MD, USA).BrdU incorporation assayThe proliferation of MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cells was examined for 72\u00a0h using an ELISA BrdU kit from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, 1 \u00d7 104 cells/well were seeded in a 96-well ELISA plate and treated for 72\u00a0h with either rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or the vehicle control suspended in low serum DMEM (supplemented with 1\u00a0% FBS). The rWNT5A was replenished every 24\u00a0h. During the final 24\u00a0h, 10\u00a0\u03bcM BrdU was added to the cells. After the termination of the experiment, the cells were fixed with FixDenat for 30\u00a0min and incubated with anti-BrdU-POD for 90\u00a0min. Antibody binding was detected via the addition of a specific substrate, and the resultant absorbance was recorded according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.Statistical analysisAll the data presented herein are expressed as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error of the mean. Each experiment was repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated. A statistical analysis was performed using Student\u2019s t-test, and p values <0.05 were considered significant. All statistical tests and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (CA, USA).ResultssiRNA-mediated knockdown of WNT5A induces \u201cEMT-like\u201d changes in human mammary epithelial HB2 cellsThe experiments in this study were conducted because the levels of WNT5A protein were previously shown to be higher in the pre-neoplastic mammary gland and early tumors than in late-stage tumors. Thus, we hypothesized that the loss of WNT5A in non-cancerous breast cells is associated with changes in the EMT status of cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we used human mammary epithelial HB2 cells in this study because they are non-cancerous and endogenously express WNT5A protein. Recently, Nash et al. advocated the use of luminal HB2 over basal MCF-10A cells for a 3D multi-cellular in vitro model of normal human breast tissue because the morphology attained by HB2 cells in tri-culture was similar to that of normal human breast acini. In addition, two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cells, were examined in this study.The loss of WNT5A induces \u201cEMT-like\u201d changes in human mammary epithelial HB2 cells. a Representative Western blot showing the presence of WNT5A protein in whole-cell lysates from MDA-MB468, HB2 and MDA-MB231 cells (n\u2009=\u20093). MDA-MB468 cells that were stably transfected with the WNT5A plasmid (MDA-MB468-5A) were used as a positive control for the experiment. Tubulin was used as a loading control. b Two different anti-WNT5A siRNA oligonucleotides were tested on HB2 cells. Total cell lysates were prepared 48\u00a0h after transfection, and Western blotting for the WNT5A protein was performed (as described in the Methods section). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n\u2009=\u20094). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. c Phase-contrast microscopy showing morphological changes in HB2 cells grown on glass coverslips and transfected with WNT5A siRNA for 48\u00a0h.

Two sequence-specific siRNAs targeted against WNT5A were used in the present experiment (as described in the Methods section). The EMT markers b E-cadherin, c vimentin and d \u03b2-catenin were quantified by calculating the integrated densitometric values and normalizing them to the tubulin levels. Statistical comparisons were made with Student\u2019s t-test (b, c and d). All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n\u2009=\u20095). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009=\u20090.01In initial experiments, endogenous WNT5A expression was evaluated in all three breast cell lines via a Western blot analysis (Fig.\u00a01a). WNT5A protein expression was not detectable in either breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231) compared to HB2 cells, which endogenously express WNT5A protein (Fig.\u00a01a). Next, HB2 cells were transiently transfected with two different sequence-specific siRNAs targeting WNT5A (as described in the Methods section) for 48\u00a0h, and Western blotting was performed using whole cell lysates to analyze the changes in WNT5A protein expression. The Western blot data demonstrated that transfection with siRNAs targeting WNT5A mRNA significantly decreased the levels of WNT5A protein (Fig.\u00a01b). Moreover, a morphological evaluation of WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells revealed distinct phenotypic changes, such as the loss of cell-cell adhesion, fibroblast-like morphology and cellular scattering (Fig.\u00a01c). These results further prompted us to investigate the changes in EMT markers in WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells. Specifically, transfection with two different sequence-specific WNT5A siRNAs resulted in the deregulation of various EMT markers in HB2 cells (Fig.\u00a02a). Integrated densitometric values (IDVs) revealed a significant decrease in the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (Fig.\u00a02b) and an increase in the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin (Fig.\u00a02c) in WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells compared with controls. However, the levels of \u03b2-catenin did not change (Fig.\u00a02d). Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that WNT5A is integral to the maintenance of epithelial architecture in mammary epithelial HB2 cells. Subsequent experiments employed only WNT5A siRNA 2 because the results from the knockdown showed that this siRNA produces more consistent and reproducible results than WNT5A siRNA 1.Addition of rWNT5A rescues the \u201cEMT-like\u201d changes induced by WNT5A knockdown in HB2 cellsrWNT5A partially rescues the EMT changes induced in HB2 cells. a Immunofluorescence staining for E-cadherin and vimentin was performed for the WNT5A rescue experiments. In these experiments, HB2 cells that were transiently transfected with WNT5A siRNA were treated with rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). For visualization, a secondary goat anti-mouse/-rabbit Alexa-488-labeled antibody was used together with DAPI counterstaining. The magnification used was 60X (n\u2009=\u20093). b Representative Western blot demonstrating a reversal in the expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and vimentin in rWNT5A-treated cells compared with cells treated with WNT5A siRNA alone. c An invasion analysis was performed using a Transwell assay, in which WNT5A siRNA-treated cells were plated on Transwell invasion inserts in either the presence or absence of rWNT5A. Vehicle-exposed cells were used as negative controls. Statistical comparisons were made with Student\u2019s t-test. All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n\u2009=\u20094). *p\u2009<\u20090.05In the next set of experiments, we investigated the ability of ectopic WNT5A to reverse the \u201cEMT-like\u201d characteristics of HB2 cells transfected with WNT5A siRNA. For these experiments, we used recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A) (R&D Systems, MN, USA). HB2 cells that had been transiently transfected with WNT5A siRNA 2 for 48\u00a0h were treated with rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml dose) for 24\u00a0h. In the control experiments, vehicle (0.1\u00a0mM EDTA, 0.5\u00a0% CHAPS, and 0.5\u00a0% BSA dissolved in PBS) was used instead of rWNT5A. An immunofluorescence analysis revealed that membranous E-cadherin expression was drastically decreased in HB2 cells treated with WNT5A siRNA and partially restored after rWNT5A addition (Fig.\u00a03apanel: E-cadherin). In agreement with this observation, we also observed an increase in the mesenchymal protein vimentin in WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells; this effect was subsequently reduced by rWNT5A (Fig.\u00a03apanel: vimentin). The immunofluorescence data were further validated by semi-quantitatively estimating the fluorescence intensities of membranous E-cadherin and vimentin in rWNT5A-treated and untreated HB2 cells (Additional file 1a and b). Similar to the immunofluorescence data, Western blotting of the whole cell lysate also revealed an increase in E-cadherin expression and a decrease in vimentin expression after the rWNT5A treatment of siRNA-transfected HB2 cells (Fig.\u00a03b). The treatment of WNT5A siRNA HB2 cells with rWNT5A also significantly decreased the expression of other mesenchymal markers (i.e., N-cadherin and Slug) compared to their increased expression in WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells (Additional file 1c, d and e). As previously observed, we did not find any changes in the \u03b2-catenin expression profile in rWNT5A-treated and untreated WNT5A siRNA-transfected HB2 cells (data not shown).To assess the effect the above-described changes in EMT markers on HB2 cell physiology, we conducted invasion assays (as described in the Methods section). We observed that WNT5A-depleted HB2 cells (transfected with WNT5A siRNA) were more invasive (p\u2009=\u20090.011) than scrambled control-treated cells, suggesting that the EMT changes associated with a loss of WNT5A in HB2 cells were coupled with increased invasion (Fig.\u00a03c). Furthermore, we also observed that the exogenous supplementation of rWNT5A significantly inhibited this increased invasion (p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Fig.\u00a03c). These data corroborate the changes in EMT marker profiles and suggest that the loss of WNT5A triggers mammary cells to acquire a more invasive and mesenchymal phenotype.As a proof-of-concept, we specifically knocked down the expression of E-cadherin in HB2 cells to demonstrate that a decrease in this epithelial marker can result in the increased invasion of HB2 cells (Additional file 2a) and that this decrease is an important event in WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells. Our results also showed that the effect of treating HB2 cells with E-cadherin siRNA on morphology is similar to that of WNT5A siRNA treatment (Additional file 2b). Moreover, further analysis revealed that the loss of E-cadherin alone cannot regulate the expression of the vimentin and WNT5A proteins in HB2 cells (Additional file 2c).Overall, these data suggest that the loss of WNT5A stimulates mammary epithelial HB2 cells towards EMT and increased invasion; however, the subsequent restoration of WNT5A resulted in EMT reversal and impaired invasion.WNT5A-treated breast cancer cells exhibit no change in EMT markersThe WNT5A-mediated effects on breast cancer cells were independent of EMT reversal. a Representative Western blot showing changes in EMT markers (viz.

These results prompted us to speculate that a similar EMT reversal mediates the ability of WNT5A signaling to impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion. To investigate this possibility, we used the MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 metastatic breast cancer cell lines. Because both cell lines lack endogenous WNT5A expression, the cells were stimulated with rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h, and total protein was then extracted from the cells for Western blotting (as described in the Methods section). In MDA-MB468 cells, the Western blot analysis revealed no changes in the protein expression of any EMT marker (E-cadherin, vimentin or \u03b2-catenin) relative to the vehicle-treated control when the cells were treated with rWNT5A for 72\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a04a). MDA-MB468 cells did not express vimentin protein. We further validated these results with an RT-qPCR analysis for these EMT markers at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h and did not find changes in any analyzed transcript (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in MDA-MB231 cells treated with rWNT5A for 72\u00a0h: treatment with rWNT5A did not cause changes in the protein levels (Fig.\u00a04b) or the mRNA levels (data not shown) of EMT markers.Consequently, we hypothesized that long-term exposure to WNT5A is required to induce EMT reversal in breast cancer cells. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the changes in EMT marker status in MDA-MB468 and MDA MB-231 cells stably transfected with a WNT5A plasmid (MDA-MB468-5A and MDA-MB231-5A cells) relative to MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cells stably transfected with an empty vector (MDA-MB468-EV; MDA-MB231-EV). We did not observe changes in any EMT marker analyzed at the protein level (Fig.\u00a04c and d). Notably, we have previously demonstrated that breast cancer cells transfected with the WNT5A plasmid exhibit low migration and invasion compared to control MDA-MB-468-EV cells.WNT5A inhibits the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via an EMT-independent mechanism(s)WNT5A significantly decreases the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. a A wound-healing migration assay and b a Transwell invasion assay were performed with the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB468 in either the presence or absence of rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h. Vehicle-treated MDA-MB468 cells were used as controls. Similarly, the relative migration and invasion (c and d) of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 were quantified in the presence or absence of rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h. Vehicle-treated MDA-MB231 cells were used as controls. Statistical comparisons were made with Student\u2019s t-test (a, b, c, and d). All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n\u2009=\u20094). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, ***p\u2009=\u20090.001WNT5A-treated breast cancer cells did not exhibit changes EMT markers, which led us to hypothesize that WNT5A suppresses the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via an EMT-independent mechanism(s). To investigate this possibility, we performed a 72\u00a0h wound healing migration assay using MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231 cells in the presence of rWNT5A, as described in the Methods section. This experiment was vital because in our previous studies, we only investigated the effect of rWNT5A on cancer cell migration/invasion for 24\u201348\u00a0h. In agreement with our earlier studies, we found that the migration of both breast cancer cell lines was significantly inhibited compared with the controls when treated with rWNT5A (0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 72\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a05a and c). We also performed a parallel BrdU proliferation assay at the same time points to eliminate the possibility that the changes in migration were due to an indirect effect on proliferation (Additional file 3). In the next step, the invasion potential of each breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231) was analyzed. We found a significant reduction in the invasion of both breast cancer cell lines after treatment with rWNT5A for 72\u00a0h (Fig.\u00a05b and d). These results further confirmed that WNT5A inhibits the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells without reversing the EMT process.WNT5A inhibits CD44-AKT signaling in breast cancer cellsWNT5A significantly inhibits CD44 and pAKT expression in breast cancer cells. a CD44 expression was analyzed in MDA-MB468-EV cells and MDA-MB468-5A cells by Western blotting. The CD44 levels in MDA-MB468-EV and MDA-MB468-5A cells were quantified by calculating integrated density values and normalizing them to the tubulin levels. b CD44 expression was analyzed in MDA-MB231-EV cells and MDA-MB231-5A cells by Western blotting. CD44 levels in MDA-MB231-EV and MDA-MB231-5A cells were quantified by calculating integrated density values and normalizing them to tubulin levels. pAKT activation was analyzed in MDA-MB468-EV cells and MDA-MB468-5A cells as in panel c and in MDA-MB231-EV cells and MDA-MB231-5A cells as in panel d. pAKT levels were quantified by calculating integrated density values and normalizing them to total AKT levels. Statistical comparisons were made with Student\u2019s t-test (a, b, c and d). All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n\u2009=\u20095). *p\u2009<\u20090.05, **p\u2009=\u20090.01, ***p\u2009=\u20090.001Because the WNT5A-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell migration and invasion was independent of EMT reversal, we explored the involvement of alternative pathways that might be triggered by WNT5A to curb the spread of breast cancer cells. To this end, we investigated the effect of WNT5A on CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein, for several reasons. First, increased CD44 expression has been correlated with breast cancer cell metastasis and a poor prognosis. Second, Jiang et al. combined microarray and RNA-Seq approaches to demonstrate that WNT5A alters the splicing of CD44 and that the levels of specific variant isoforms of CD44 (e.g., CD44v4 and CD44v6) were reduced in a WNT5A-expressing cell line. In our previous studies, we also demonstrated that the role of WNT5A in increased adhesion is mediated by its ability to phosphorylate DDR1, resulting in the reduced migration of breast cancer cells. Because CD44 overexpression alone is sufficient to induce breast cancer cell migration and invasion, we investigated the ability of WNT5A signaling to directly regulate CD44 expression in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we next analyzed the expression of CD44 protein in breast cancer cells stably expressing WNT5A protein. CD44 immunofluorescence staining revealed that both breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB468-5A and MDA-MB231-5A) expressed reduced levels CD44 membrane protein compared to their counterpart controls, which were transfected with empty vector (Additional file 4). Subsequently, we validated our findings by Western blotting, demonstrating that WNT5A expression does indeed inhibit the expression of CD44 protein in WNT5A-expressing breast cancer cell lines (Fig.\u00a06a and b). CD44 is a receptor that can stimulate tumorigenic signals via a variety of downstream pathways and effectors, such as PI3K/AKT signaling and MMP-9. Therefore, we next investigated whether the WNT5A-mediated reduction in CD44 decreased PI3K/AKT signaling in breast cancer cells. We found a significant reduction in the expression of pAKT in both WNT5A-transfected breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB468-5A and MDA-MB231-5A) compared to control cells (Fig.\u00a06c and d). The data were further validated in parental MDA-MB231 cells treated with rWNT5A (0.2 and 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 24\u00a0h (Additional file 5a). We observed a dose-dependent decrease in the expression of pAKT, thereby validating our finding that WNT5A indeed inhibits the CD44-AKT signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.Furthermore, to assess the effect of WNT5A on CD44 protein expression in HB2 mammary epithelial cells, we knocked down the expression of WNT5A these cells using siRNA (Additional file 5b). This knockdown did not affect the level of CD44 protein, suggesting that WNT5A does not modulate CD44 expression in HB2 mammary epithelial cells.CD44 knockdown reduces the level of pAKT, migration and invasion of breast cancer cellCD44 and ERK1/2 inhibition and the migration and invasion of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. MDA-MB231 cells were transiently transfected with CD44 siRNA (as described in the Methods section), and changes in the cellular characteristics were investigated. a Representative Western blot demonstrating that the silencing of CD44 expression induces changes in pAKT levels. After CD44 knockdown, MDA-MB231 cells were subjected to b Transwell migration and c Transwell invasion assays. Statistical comparisons were made with Student\u2019s t-test (b and c). All error bars represent the standard error of the mean (n\u2009=\u20094). *p\u2009<\u20090.05. d MDA-MB468 and e MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells were treated with U0126 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) or left untreated for 24\u00a0h, and Western blotting was used to determine CD44 expression. The expression of pERK1/2 was also analyzed as an experimental control. The blots shown are representative of three independent experiments (n\u2009=\u20093)Our experiments showed that WNT5A inhibited CD44 expression in breast cancer cells but not in HB2 cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that reduced levels of CD44 are responsible for the WNT5A-mediated reduction in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we used siRNA to knock down CD44 expression in MDA-MB231 cells and evaluated the effect of this knockdown on the pAKT levels, cell migration and invasion. CD44 siRNA-treated cells demonstrated reduced pAKT levels (Fig.\u00a07a) and significant decreases in their migratory and invasive capabilities compared with their respective controls (Fig.\u00a07b and c). In support of these findings, MDA-MB468 cells treated with CD44 siRNA also showed a significant decrease in migration compared to control cells (Additional file 6). Overall, our results demonstrate that the WNT5A-mediated reduction in CD44-AKT signaling plays an important role in inhibiting breast cancer cell migration and invasion.We previously demonstrated that WNT5A inhibits ERK1/2 signaling in breast cancer cells. In the present study, we showed that WNT5A affects breast cancer cell migration and invasion by inhibiting CD44 expression and downstream AKT signaling. To investigate the role of altered ERK1/2 signaling in the WNT5A-mediated inhibition of CD44, we treated breast cancer cell lines with U0126 (a selective inhibitor of MAP kinase). Treatment with U0126 for 24\u00a0h drastically reduced CD44 protein expression in MDA-MB468 (Fig.\u00a07d) and MDA-MB231 (Fig.\u00a07e) cells, suggesting that CD44 is a downstream target of the MAP kinase pathway in these cells. Thus, these results suggest that WNT5A-impaired ERK1/2 signaling, which as mimicked by the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 in the present study, reduces CD44 expression in breast cancer cells.DiscussionWe have previously shown that the loss of WNT5A in HB2 cells leads to cell scattering, reduced cell-collagen interaction and increased motility, and we established the role of WNT5A signaling in regulating DDR1 phosphorylation, increased adhesion and decreased migration. In the present study, knocking down WNT5A in mammary HB2 cells resulted in increased invasion and EMT-like changes. These changes included phenotypic changes, such as cellular scattering, the loss of cell-cell adhesion and a fibroblast-like morphology, as well as significant increases in the expression of established mesenchymal markers. Interestingly, our data revealed that ectopic stimulation with rWNT5A reversed the increased invasion and the EMT-like changes in mammary epithelial HB2 cells.The above observations corroborate clinical observations made in breast cancer tissues, where a loss of WNT5A expression has been correlated with increased metastasis and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. According to recent findings from Borcherding et al., early breast tumors and pre-neoplastic lesions express WNT5A protein; however, its expression decreases in late-stage tumors and lung metastases. Accordingly, J\u00f6nsson et al. have also demonstrated the loss of WNT5A protein in invasive ductal carcinoma patients, which is in contrast to the expression of WNT5A in DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ). The current literature on WNT5A expression in breast cancer strongly advocates its role as an oncosuppressor, and the loss of WNT5A expression is one of the causes of increased breast cancer progression.These data suggest that the ability of WNT5A signaling to impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion is due to an EMT reversal similar to that observed in mammary HB2 cells. We previously reported that WNT5A at least in part inhibits the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by reducing the production and secretion of MMP9. This finding is relevant to the potential of WNT5A to reverse EMT in breast cancer cells because MMPs have been demonstrated to facilitate EMT in these cells. However, neither the rWNT5A treatment of nor stably transfecting the WNT5A protein into breast cancer cells produced any changes in EMT markers, although WNT5A signaling still inhibited the migration and invasion of both breast cancer cell lines under similar conditions. Thus, WNT5A inhibits the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via an EMT-independent mechanism. This effect of WNT5A appears to be tumor type specific because a recent study of HCT116 colon cancer cells has suggested that WNT5A can reverse EMT by antagonizing canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in these cells. Conversely, we did not find any changes in the \u03b2-catenin expression levels in WNT5A siRNA-treated HB2 cells or in breast cancer cell lines exposed to WNT5A treatments. This finding further supports the hypothesis that the function of WNT5A depends on the cancer cell type.EMT reversal is clearly not responsible for the WNT5A-mediated inhibition of breast cancer cell migration and invasion; therefore, we sought alternative explanations for this phenomenon. Our results demonstrate that WNT5A signaling affects the expression of the transmembrane glycoprotein CD44, and WNT5A is known to alter the splicing of CD44 and its variant isoforms in breast cancer. We clearly showed that WNT5A suppresses CD44, which consequently reduces downstream AKT signaling in breast cancer cells. CD44 is known to regulate PI3K/AKT signaling in breast cancer, and this pathway plays an important role in cell survival, invasion and metastasis. Considerable research has indicated that MAPK-ERK signaling regulates CD44 expression in various types of cancer. This finding is interesting because we have previously demonstrated that WNT5A inhibits ERK1/2 activity in breast cancer cells, which suggests that WNT5A regulates CD44 via ERK1/2. Using an ERK1/2 inhibitor to mimic the inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by WNT5A, we confirmed a link between ERK1/2-MAPK signaling and CD44 expression in breast cancer cells. In accordance with the reported positive association between CD44 and breast cancer metastasis, the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells significantly impaired in our siRNA-CD44 knockdown experiments.The experimental data presented herein corroborate the relationship between the expression levels of WNT5A and CD44 in clinical breast cancer samples and their relation to disease-free survival and cumulative survival of patients with breast cancer. Importantly, information on the interaction between WNT5A and CD44 cannot be directly obtained from clinical material, but it can be obtained from experimental data. Therefore, experimental and clinical data are complementary. The data from different research groups have revealed that WNT5A expression in clinical breast cancer samples is marker of good prognosis, whereas CD44 expression has been associated with poor prognosis. Similar findings have also been reported in triple-negative and basal breast cancer tissues. Moreover, treatment with either a WNT5A agonist or a monoclonal antibody against CD44 in mouse breast cancer models impaired tumor progression, which suggests a therapeutic possibility. The present study demonstrated that WNT5A signaling can suppress CD44 protein expression and signaling, which supports the use of a WNT5A agonist in the treatment of breast cancer patients.ConclusionsUnlike in mammary epithelial cells, the inhibition of migration and invasion by WNT5A signaling is an EMT-independent event in breast cancer cells. This study demonstrated that WNT5A inhibits CD44 expression and its downstream AKT signaling, which further explains how WNT5A signaling impairs breast cancer cell migration and invasion.Additional filesAbbreviationsECMExtracellular matrixEMTEpithelial mesenchymal transitionMMPMatrix metalloproteinaserWNT5ARecombinant WNT5ATNBCTriple negative breast cancerReferencesWnt signaling: a common theme in animal developmentMechanism and function of signal transduction by the Wnt/beta-catenin and Wnt/Ca2+ pathwaysTransformation by Wnt family proteins correlates with regulation of beta-cateninWnt signaling and stem cell controlInternational Union of basic and clinical pharmacology.

        "content": "Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a detrimental role in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In-depth analysis of TAM characteristics and interactions with stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), could provide important biological and therapeutic insights. Here we identify at the single-cell level a monocyte-derived STAB1+TREM2high lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subpopulation with immune suppressive capacities that is expanded in patients resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Genetic depletion of this LAM subset in mice suppressed TNBC tumor growth. Flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that coculture with TNBC-derived CAFs led to reprogramming of blood monocytes towards immune suppressive STAB1+TREM2high LAMs, which inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Cell-to-cell interaction modeling and assays in vitro demonstrated the role of the inflammatory CXCL12-CXCR4 axis in CAF-myeloid cell cross-talk and recruitment of monocytes in tumor sites. Altogether, these data suggest an inflammation model whereby monocytes recruited to the tumor via the CAF-driven CXCL12-CXCR4 axis acquire protumorigenic LAM capacities to support an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This work identifies a novel lipid-associated macrophage subpopulation with immune suppressive functions, offering new leads for therapeutic interventions in triple-negative breast cancer.",

In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytoskeleton. The role of p21 in breast cancer development and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers. Furthermore, in vivo studies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these animals developed normally. Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcinomas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microenvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGF\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis. The TGF\u03b2 family regulates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life. The effects of TGF\u03b2 in breast cancer are complex. TGF\u03b2 is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in normal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma. The growth inhibitory effects of TGF\u03b2 are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGF\u03b2 growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGF\u03b2. Meanwhile, other TGF\u03b2 responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis. Indeed, TGF\u03b2 induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGF\u03b2, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosuppression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGF\u03b2 in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGF\u03b2 has not been described in breast cancer.In this study, we found that high p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like triple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyltransferase p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2 and identified p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carcinomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion downstream of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.MethodsCell culture and transfectionHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25 cells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagu\u00e9) and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. SUM149PT, SUM159PT and SUM229PE (provided by Dr. Stephen P Ethier) were grown in F-12 HAM'S nutrient mixture (HyClone Laboratories, Inc. Logan, Utah, USA) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 \u00b5g/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 \u00b5g/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

MDA and SCPs cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b21 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine. For stable cell line generation, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and pools of stable cells were selected with 10 ng/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs in the absence of insulin and hydrocortisone before TGF\u03b21 stimulation.Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitationCells were lysed in cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin hydrochloride, 10 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 10 \u00b5g/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal protein was analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-p21 (F5), mouse anti-c-myc, mouse anti-p15, rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-cofilin and cofilin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and followed by secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or rabbit. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4\u00b0C using antibodies against p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (Abcam\u00ae, Cambridge, MA, USA) and p21. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was added for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and washed four times with cold lysis buffer. The immunocomplexes were boiled with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.Histone proteins extractionTotal histone proteins were extracted as previously described. Briefly, 80% confluent of SCP2 cells from a 100-mm tissue culture plate were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 or 1 \u00b5M trichostatin A (TSA). SCP2 cells were harvested and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 \u00b5M TSA and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u00b5l trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes. Total histone proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an acetylated lysine antibody (Millipore).DNA affinity precipitation assaySCP2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated siRNAs were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. Cell lysate were extracted in cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors as described above. A total of 5 \u00b5g Poly (dI-dC) competitor (Sigma) was incubated with 1 mg of total cell lysate for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. A total of 500 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotides (IDT) was added and incubated with cell lysates for two hours at 4\u00b0C. Streptavidin-agarose beads (65 \u00b5l; Sigma) were added, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose beads containing biotinylated oligonucleotides and protein complex were boiled with 2\u00d7 SDS Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting. The sequences of biotin labeled double-strand oligonucleotides (IDT) were previously described. For Smad binding element oligonucleotide (4\u00d7 SBE), Sense: biotin-5'-CAGACAGTCAGACAGTCAGACAGTCAGACAGT-3', antisense: 5'-ACTGTCTGACTGTCTGACTGTCTGACTGTCTG-3'.

Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase activity.Real-Time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equipment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s). The primer sequences were as follows: IL8 forward primer, GCAGAGGCCACCTGGATTGTGC; reverse primer, TGGCATGTTGCAGGCTCCTCAGAA; IL6 forward primer, CTCCCCTCCAGGAGCCCAGC; reverse primer, GCAGGGAAGGCAGCAGGCAA; PLAU forward primer, GCCCTGGTTTGCGGCCATCT; reverse primer, CGCACACCTGCCCTCCTTGG; MMP9 forward primer, TGGACACGCACGACGTCTTCC; reverse primer, TAGGTCACGTAGCCCACTTGGTCC; PTGS2 forward primer, AGCTTTCACCAACGGGCTGGG; reverse primer, AAGACCTCCTGCCCCACAGCAA; TGFBI forward primer, CGGCTGCTGCTGAAAGCCGACCA; reverse primer, GGTCGGGGCCAAAAGCGTGT; p21 forward primer, TGTCCGCGAGGATGCGTGTTC; reverse primer, GCAGCCCGCCATTAGCGCAT; GAPDH forward primer, GCCTCAAGATCATCAGCAATGCCT; reverse primer, TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCACGAT.Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assayA total of 100 \u00b5l of cell suspension (1\u00d7 105 cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS) was stimulated or not in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 and cultured in 96-well plates for two days. After two days, 25 \u00b5l 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured on a plate reader.Cell cycle analysisSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight, treated with 20 \u00b5g/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.Kinetic cell migration assayCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same location by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u00b5m width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and stimulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGF\u03b2. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.Matrigel invasion assayFor the Transwell assays, 30 \u00b5l of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell invasion plate (8-\u00b5m pore size; BD Biosciences) and incubated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers contained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S medium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).Immunofluorescence microscopyCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axiovert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysisTissue sections (5 \u00b5m) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detection of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a pathologist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moderately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21 were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Mammary fat pad and intratibia injections of nude miceFour- to six-week old female Balb/c nude mice were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Wilmington, MA, USA) and used as a model for primary mammary tumor formation and local invasion. The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injection to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u00b5m thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives.For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).Statistical analysesStudent's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.Resultsp21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patientsPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas. To further explore the correlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently published gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metastasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical significance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.High p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A-C, The relationship of higher p21 expression and breast cancer outcome was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The survival rates were analyzed using three different and separate splits of the patients, based on p21 expression levels (A, median; B, upper quartile; C, lower quartile). For each split, the patients were then divided into high and low groups with respect to p21 expression. Overall survival (left panels) and distant metastasis-free survival (right panels) correlate with p21 gene expression. Number of breast cancer patients at risk with higher expression (red) and lower expression (black) of p21 at the indicated time points.Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-metastatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells. We first assessed the effect of suppressing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21 depletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early tumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tissue), as previously described. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group displayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively).Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion. A, Total lysates from parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were analyzed by immunoblotting for the protein levels of p21 and \u03b2-tubulin. B, Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were injected into the mammary glands of four- to six-week-old female Balb/c nude mice. The size of mammary tumor was measured from two sets of mice (eight per group; error bars indicate SEM). C, Representative photographs show hematoxylin and eosin staining of the mammary gland (tumor and fat pad) of 12- to 15-month-old mice. D and E, Transwell cell migration (left panel) and GFR-Matrigel invasion assay (right panel) of parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were performed. Graphs show total migrated and invaded cell number counted by Image J (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). Student's unpaired t-test was used to compare parental vs. shRNA p21 SCP2 groups. Differences were considered significant at *P < 0.05.As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experimental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indicate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cellsp21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways. Among these and of particular interest is the TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarcinoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25), an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with anaplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carcinoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal carcinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315). As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGF\u03b2 strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGF\u03b2 showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regulatory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGF\u03b2 growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhibitor, the TGF\u03b2-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investigated the mechanisms by which TGF\u03b2 regulates p21 protein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGF\u03b2-induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGF\u03b2 regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGF\u03b2 receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGF\u03b2 induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGF\u03b2 potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-type breast cancer cells.TGF\u03b2 induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells. A, Real-time PCR was performed to measure the mRNA level of p21 gene (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments) for the indicated cell lines. B, Cells were treated with or without 5 ng/ml TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. C, Total cell lysates were analyzed for c-myc, p15 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. D, SCP25 cells were pretreated with 10 \u00b5M TGF\u03b2 type I receptor (T\u03b2RI) inhibitor (SB431542) or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 minutes and then stimulated with TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting. E, MDA cells were transfected with 40 nM Scrambled (Scr), Smad2 or Smad3 siRNAs in response to TGF\u03b2. Total cell lysates were analyzed for Smad2/3, p21 and \u03b2-tubulin protein levels by Western blotting.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migrationTGF\u03b2 is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGF\u03b2 to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGF\u03b2 did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell migration. A, Representative images of phase contrast and wound mask of indicated cell lines stimulated with TGF\u03b2 in scratch/wound healing assay. The initial wound mask (black) and wound closure (grey) were measured using the Essen Instruments Scratch Wound Module. B, The time course of cell migration for the indicated cell lines was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNAs and then stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 24 hrs. Total cell lysates were analyzed for p21 and \u03b2-tubulin by Western blotting. D, Representative images of phase contrast (top panels) and wound mask (bottom panels) of transfected SCP2 cells with the indicated siRNAs in scratch/wound healing assay. E, The time course of transfected SCP2 cell migration was quantified using the relative wound density metrics at two-hour time intervals (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGF\u03b2 on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C, TGF\u03b2 induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2 cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGF\u03b2-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E). We also confirmed that these effects on cell migration were not secondary to changes in cell growth, as silencing of p21 expression had no effect on cell growth and proliferation (Figure S4C). These results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression.p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasionTo examine the role of p21 in TGF\u03b2-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGF\u03b2 significantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limitation of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGF\u03b2 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpression of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGF\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGF\u03b2-induced p21 expression. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGF\u03b2 signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).p21 expression is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated cell invasion. A, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and cultured in the presence or absence of TGF\u03b2. GFR-Matrigel coated Transwell invasion assay was performed and images of the invading cells were photographed. B, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with a Scr or p21 siRNA as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA in the presence or the absence of TGF\u03b2. p21 protein levels were then analyzed by Western blotting. D, Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. The number of invaded cells was counted by Image J (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments). E, Cell invasion of transfected SUM159 was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. F, Total cell number was counted by Image J and fold induction was quantified (error bars indicate SD; n = 3 independent experiments).p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasionIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regulates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migration in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGF\u03b2. As shown in Figure S7A (Additional file 8), TGF\u03b2 has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGF\u03b2. Treatment with TGF\u03b2 caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGF\u03b2-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors to selectively inhibit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in distinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could interact with the Smad proteins to regulate the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive effects. Smad/p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGF\u03b2 to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGF\u03b2 signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. However, using a TGF\u03b2/Smad transcriptional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silencing abolished TGF\u03b2-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overexpressing p21 in response to TGF\u03b2. These results indicate that TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphorylation), it is required for TGF\u03b2-mediated Smad transcriptional activity.p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGF\u03b2-induced transcriptional activity. A, HEK293 and SCP2 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. Transfected cells were stimulated TGF\u03b2 for 8 hrs. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and p21 antibodies. B, Transfected MDA cells were immunoblotting by phospho-Smad3 (p-Smad3), Smad2/3 and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies in response to TGF\u03b2 for 30 minutes. C, SCP2 cells were co-transfected with either mock, Scr siRNA, p21 siRNA or flag-tagged p21 construct (p21 cDNA) and SBE promoter construct (CAGA12-luc). Transfected cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).We next performed gene profiling experiments in parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasminogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9). To confirm that these genes were TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were stimulated or not with TGF\u03b2 and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGF\u03b2 significantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines.To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional regulation of these genes by TGF\u03b2, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGF\u03b2 to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGF\u03b2 transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGF\u03b2 regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B).p21 regulates TGF\u03b2-induced downstream genes involved in cell invasion. A, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p21 siRNA as well as p21 cDNA. Cells were then treated with or without TGF\u03b2 and the mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). B, SUM159 cells transfected with Scr siRNA and p21 siRNA were treated with TGF\u03b2 for the indicated times. The mRNA level of TGFBI gene was measured by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). C, SCP2 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs. Cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion assay. D, Total cell number was counted by Image J and number of invaded cells was quantified (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).To address the contribution of these identified p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antagonized the TGF\u03b2 response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examination of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggesting that they may be specifically required for the TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGF\u03b2 signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predominant roles.p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA bindingp21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcription by associating with various transcription factors, but also regulates estrogen receptor-\u03b1-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP). Gene transcription downstream of TGF\u03b2 signaling is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-acetyl transferases. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGF\u03b2. Interestingly, we found that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce association between p21 and p300/CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).p21/p/CAF regulates TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity and Smad3 occupancy on SBE. A, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were treated with TGF\u03b2. Cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies, as indicated. B, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA. Transfected cells were stimulated with TGF\u03b2 for eight hours. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-flag antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting using Smad2/3 and flag antibodies. C and D, SUM159 cells were transfected with Scr or p/CAF siRNAs as well as a flag-tagged p21 cDNA, treated with or without TGF\u03b2. The mRNA levels of indicated genes were analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). E, SCP2 cells transfected with Scr and p/CAF siRNA were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2. Cell invasion was quantified by relative TGF\u03b2 fold induction (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments). F, Transfected SCP2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting p/CAF and \u03b2-tubulin. G, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad3, myc-Smad2 and p/CAF. Immunoprecipitated Smad2/3 using an anti-myc antibody was subjected to Western blotting. H, DNA precipitation (DNA IP) was performed using biotinylated control and 4\u00d7 CAGA SBE oligonucleotides, following by streptavidin precipitation. Western blotting of Smad3 and p/CAF is shown. I, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 or p/CAF siRNAs. Samples were subjected to DNA IP and immunoblotting of Smad3. J, Transfected SCP2 cells were stimulated with or without TGF\u03b2 for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured and normalized to \u03b2-galactosidase (error bars indicated SEM; n =3 independent experiments).A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds to Smad3. As we have shown that TGF\u03b2 induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGF\u03b2 induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interaction, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21.To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regulation of p21-dependent TGF\u03b2 downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGF\u03b2. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGF\u03b2 targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGF\u03b2 was further investigated using the Transwell Matrigel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGF\u03b2-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F).Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene transcription by acetylating histones and transcription factors, we then assessed whether TGF\u03b2 could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGF\u03b2 and subjected to immunoblotting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Figure S8 (Additional file 9), TGF\u03b2 had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more directed towards acetylation of specific targets rather than global histone modifications. To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interacting with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acetylation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad binding element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGF\u03b2 to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siRNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGF\u03b2-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity.Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGF\u03b2 transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGF\u03b2 induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Furthermore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGF\u03b2 target gene transcription.High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivityLymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes. High expression of TGF\u03b21 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis. To examine the association among active TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immunohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of 3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expressions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Additional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phosphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.High expression of p/CAF/p21/pSmad3 is associated with lymph node positivity.

B, Overall pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF immunohistochemistry staining intensity between lymph node negative (LN-) and positive (LN+) tissues. C, Percentage of case distribution according to immunoreactivity of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF in tumor cells, the score for negative (0), low (1 to 2) and high (3 to 4).DiscussionWhile p21 was initially characterized as an important cell cycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic p21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatory functions. The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation. Moreover, overexpression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expression did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evidence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion.Previous studies have indicated that during breast cancer progression, TGF\u03b2 cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGF\u03b2 and that while TGF\u03b2 did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, where TGF\u03b2-mediated p21 gene expression leads to cell cycle arrest. Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects of TGF\u03b2. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capacity. These findings together support the notion of a direct oncogenic role for p21 in breast cancer progression.We further report that the TGF\u03b2-mediated increase in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 specific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize and that Smad3, but not Smad2, promotes breast cancer metastasis in mice. Furthermore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients.Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; however, we found that TGF\u03b2 had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regulation of TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-dependent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through interactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2 pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interesting to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGF\u03b2 or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGF\u03b2 responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast cancer cells (Figure 10).Model of pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. The role of p21 as both a direct transcriptional target of TGF\u03b2 and a co-stimulatory factor of p/CAF/Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in triple negative breast cancer cells.Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGF\u03b2-mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clinical and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic parameters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGF\u03b2/Smad3 signaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node positivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.ConclusionIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGF\u03b2-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGF\u03b2-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGF\u03b2-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.AbbreviationsBSA: bovine serum albumin; DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DMFS: distant metastasis free survival; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; ECM: extracellular matrix; p15: p15Ink4b; EGF: epidermal growth factor; ER: estrogen receptor; FBS: fetal bovine serum; GFR: growth factor reduced; IL6: interleukin 6; MMP9: matrix metalloproteinase 9; MTT: thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide; OS: overall survival; p21: p21Cip1; p/CAF: p300/CBP-associated factor; PLAU: plasminogen activator; PTGS2: prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulphate; T\u03b2RI: TGF\u03b2 type I receptor; TGF\u03b2: transforming growth factor-beta; TSA: trichostatin ACompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors' contributionsMD and JJL designed the experiments and wrote the manuscript.

IntroductionTumors are heterogeneous cellular entities in which progression depends on the dynamic crosstalk between cancer cells and other cells present in the stromal microenvironment. The stroma is composed of supporting cells including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells and various types of immune cells. These cells are surrounded by fibrous structural proteins that comprise a dense extracellular matrix. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a predominant stromal cellular component in most solid tumors including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Previously it has been shown that resident tissue fibroblasts, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, adipocytes and endothelial cells can all give rise to CAFs, each by different mechanisms. In addition, CAFs may arise directly from the cancer cells themselves via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Factors released from CAFs into the tumor microenvironment play crucial roles in tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Thus, targeting CAFs directly to turn off their downstream effects or inhibiting CAF-secreted factors that stimulate tumor development and progression could represent a potential strategy for treating solid tumors.Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women where an estimated 1.7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide, every year. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer, characterized by the absence of three receptors: estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBCs are resistant to most available targeted therapies because these treatments require the presence of at least one of these receptors to be effective in killing the cancer cells. In addition, ~10\u201320% of all invasive breast cancers are TNBC. TNBC metastasizes earlier and more frequently than other types of breast tumors; the 5-year survival rate for patients with TNBC is ~77% compared to 93% for all other breast cancer types. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating TNBC is urgently needed. Understanding the crosstalk between CAF subtypes and other cells in the TNBC microenvironment could open potential new avenues for cancer treatment.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also coexist as heterogeneous populations, and several CAF subtypes with distinct molecular profiles have been identified in various cancers. Although CAFs are the most prominent stromal components in solid tumors, identifying all possible subtypes and their specialized functions is far from complete. It has been previously shown that CAFs express high levels of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2), CD90 (Thy1), platelet-derived growth factor receptors \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Pdgfra/b), integrin \u03b21/CD29, podoplanin (Pdpn), osteonectin (Sparc), fibroblast activation protein (Fap), fibroblast-specific protein 1 (S100a4), caveolin 1 (Cav1) and vimentin (Vim). Several recent studies have used these markers to identify and characterize CAFs in various cancers. However, these markers are far from being all-encompassing or completely specific to these cell subtypes, preventing us from identifying subtle differences among CAF subtypes using conventional methods. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to profile gene expression in individual cells in a tissue with complex architecture and provides a high-resolution window into transcriptional differences. In turn, these molecular differences may lead to a better understanding of the function of each specific cell. Furthermore, scRNA-seq enables us to discover rare cell types that until now may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Several studies have utilized scRNA-seq to investigate CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors including pancreatic, breast and colorectal cancer, advancing our understanding of CAF heterogeneity, but no study to date has compared CAF subpopulations in various tumor types and also to fibroblast subpopulations present in healthy, normal tissues.In this study, we characterized the fibroblast heterogeneity in a mouse allograft model of TNBC. Syngeneic mammary fat pad tumors were generated by injecting 4T1 breast cancer cells into BALB/c mice. Palpable tumors were dissected, and gene expression was profiled at single-cell level. The scRNA-seq analysis identified six CAF subpopulations in 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors including: 1) a CAF subpopulation with elevated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other contractile proteins including Tnc, Tagln and Myl9; 2) a subpopulation enriched in Ly6c1 and inflammatory cytokines Cxcl12, Il6 and Ccl2; and 3) a CAF subpopulation expressing Cd74 and other MHC class II proteins. Furthermore, we compared the CAF signatures of 4T1 tumors to those of pancreatic tumors from a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM), the KPC mouse, and from subcutaneous allografts with a cell line (mT3) derived from the KPC mice, and of normal tissue resident fibroblasts to determine their similarities and differences. \u03b1-SMA-high CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs were found in both breast and pancreatic tumors and shared highly similar transcriptional profiles. Interestingly, cells with inflammatory CAF profile and MHC class II-expressing CAF profile were also found endogenous to healthy breast/pancreas tissues, suggesting that these types of fibroblasts are not induced by the tumor microenvironment and may play important roles in tissue homeostasis.2. Results2.1. scRNA-seq Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of CAFs in Murine Mammary TumorsscRNA-seq was conducted on viable cells isolated from BALB/c-derived 4T1 orthotopic tumors using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (Figure 1A). Of cells sequenced, 6420 cells met our quality control metrics and were further analyzed to identify various cell types in the tumor. A graph-based clustering using Seurat identified 12 cell clusters (Figure 1B). By cross-referencing genes differentially expressed in each cluster to previously published cell-type specific markers, we assigned each cluster to its putative cell-type identity (Figure 1B). Cells in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 expressed CD45 (Ptprc) and several other markers of myeloid and lymphoid lineages, and were classified as immune cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Immune cells accounted for 66.4% of all sequenced cells. Clusters expressing high levels of Epcam (clusters 1 and 6) were identified as epithelial/cancer cells and accounted for ~24.5% of all cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). Cells in cluster 4 had high levels of Thy1, Pdpn and Pdgfra and were identified as CAFs (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). This cluster included 535 cells and accounted for ~8% of all cells analyzed. Cells in cluster 10 expressed high levels of Pecam1 and Mcam and were identified as endothelial cells (Figure 1B,C, Table S1). We also identified a small population of pericytes (cluster 11) (Figure 1B). Interestingly, pericytes shared many markers with CAFs including Thy1 and Pdgfrb but also had unique markers such as NG2 (Cspg4), Mcam and Rgs5 (Figure 1C, Table S1).Next, we compared the gene expression profile of CAFs (cluster 4) to other cell types in the tumor. Although we were only able to identify fewer CAFs in 4T1 mammary tumors than generally expected (~8% CAFs vs ~66% immune cells and ~24% cancer cells), potentially due to the limitations of the single cell isolation method, our analysis identified a large number of genes significantly enriched in CAFs compared to other cell types (Table S1). CAFs have been shown to play a major role in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and organization. Consistent with these functions, 4T1-derived CAFs showed enrichment for collagens (Col1a1, Col1a2, Col3a1, Col5a1-3, Col6a1-3 etc.), proteoglycans (Dcn, Lum, Bgn, Prg4 etc.) and glycoproteins (Postn, Dpt, Tnc, Fbln, Fbn1 etc.) (Figure 1D,E). Although CAFs expressed basement membrane collagens Col4a1 and Col4a2, the highest expression for these two genes was detected in pericytes and endothelial cells. CAFs also expressed high levels of several enzymes involved in processing and assembly of collagen into fibrils including Adamts-2, prolyl-4-hydroxylases (P4ha1-3), lysyl hydroxylases (Plod1-3) and lysyl oxidases (Lox, Loxl1-3) (Figure 1D). Several ECM catabolic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinase-2 (Mmp2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3) and cathepsin K (Ctsk) were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1D). CAFs also showed enrichment for bone morphogenic protein 1 (Bmp1), Tgf-\u03b2 receptors (Tgfbr2, Tgfrb3), Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors (Sfrp1, Sfrp2, Sfrp4), complement pathway genes (C1ra, C1s1, C3, C4b), cytokines and cytokine receptors including Cxcl1, Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Il1r1 and Il11ra1(Figure 1F, Table S1). Cell adhesion proteins Cdh11 and Chl1 were also enriched in CAFs (Figure 1F).2.2. Six Distinct Subtypes of CAFs Were Detected in Murine Mammary TumorsTo better understand CAF heterogeneity in syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors, we performed scRNA-seq on an immune (CD45+) and cancer cell (Thy1.1+) depleted fraction of 4T1-Thy1.1 tumor single cell suspension (Figure 1A). Among the ~4000 cells sequenced, we detected epithelial (Epcam+), endothelial (Pecam1+), pericytes (Mcam+, Rgs5+) and low levels of immune cells (CD45+); these cells were excluded from subsequent analysis (Figure S1A,B). The remaining ~1600 cells were classified as CAFs based on the expression of commonly used CAF markers (Figure S1A,C). Unsupervised clustering of these CAFs identified six distinct clusters with unique gene expression signatures (Figure 2A and Figure S1D\u2013E). CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1 and Pdgfra and CAF-secreted collagens Col1a1 and Col3a1 were expressed in all these clusters (Figure 2B). Cells in cluster 0 expressed high levels of lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus C1 (Ly6c1) while cells in cluster 1 were highly enriched for alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2) (Figure 2C); as such, these genes were chosen to represent these clusters. Cells in cluster 2 expressed high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) and other cell cycle genes including Cenpa and Cenpf and were identified as \u2018dividing cells\u2019 (Figure 2C). Leukocyte surface antigen Cd53 was highly enriched in cluster 3 and was used as a marker for this cluster (Figure 2C). Cells in cluster 4 showed significant enrichment for cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (Crabp1), while cells in cluster 5 showed enrichment for Cd74 (Figure 2C). Crabp1 and Cd74 were chosen as representative markers of clusters 4 and 5, respectively. We also found that these clusters had distinct gene expression profiles with a significant number of genes differentially expressed between these six clusters (Figure 2D, Table S2).To explore the relationship among these CAF subtypes, we constructed a transcriptional trajectory of these cells on a pseudotime scale using Monocle. Cells in cluster 0 (Ly6c1high) were distributed at one end of the pseudotemporal trajectory whereas cells in cluster 1 (\u03b1-SMA/Acta2high) resided at the other end, suggesting that these clusters are most divergent from each other (Figure 2E,F). Pseudotime analysis also suggested that dividing/cycling cells from cluster 2 (Cdk1high) included cells diverging from both Ly6c1high and Acta2high clusters (Figure 2E,F). Cluster 3 (Cd53high) cells existed along the trajectory. Cluster 4 (Crabp1high) resided next to Ly6c1high cluster while cluster 5 (Cd74high) cells were mainly distributed at the other end of the trajectory, closer to the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure 2E,F).The Ly6c1high (cluster 0) and \u03b1-SMAhigh (cluster 1) clusters together constituted ~79% of fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor (Figure 2A) and were further analyzed to gain insights into their potential roles in tumor development and progression (Figure 3A,B). Ly6c1 is an antigen present in neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic cells, and T cells and its function in fibroblasts is not yet known. The Ly6c1high cluster also expressed other marker genes including ECM protein dermatopontin (Dpt), plasminogen-binding C-type lectin tetranectin (Clec3b), and hyaluronan synthase 1 (Has1), an enzyme responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis at higher levels (Figure 3A). In addition, Ly6c1high cluster showed enrichment for stem cell antigen-1 (Ly6a/Sca-1), serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), collagen 14a1 (Col14a1) which plays a regulatory role in collagen fibrillogenesis, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin (Ogn), proteoglycan 4 (Prg4), prolargin (Prelp), EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Efemp1), and HtrA serine peptidase 3 (Htra3) (Figure S2A). Hyaluronan, a major non-protein glycosaminoglycan component of the ECM, has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, EMT and cancer stem cell activation. Increased Has1 expression may contribute to increased hyaluronan synthesis in Ly6c1high CAFs. Ogn plays a restrictive role in cancer progression. Htra3 may also have a tumor-suppressive function. Efemp1 and Prg4 can have either tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive function. We also observed elevated expression of transcripts encoding immune modulatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (Il6), interleukin 33 (Il33), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/Ccl2) and monocyte-chemotactic protein 3 (MCP3/Ccl7) and several members of compliment pathway including C3, C4b, C1s1 and C1s2 in Ly6c1high cluster (Figure 3C,D), suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs play a role in regulating the immune responses in the tumor microenvironment.The \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 1), had a molecular signature similar to the myofibroblasts, which have been shown to play crucial roles in wound healing and pathological tissue remodeling. Genes highly expressed in the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster but absent or significantly reduced in other clusters included: contractile proteins tropomyosins 1 and 2 (Tpm1, Tpm2) and myosin light chain 9 (Myl9), transgelin (Tagln), calponins (Cnn2 and Cnn3), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (Igfbp3), tenascin C (Tnc) and transmembrane Protein 119 (Tmem119) (Figure 3B and Figure S2A). Interestingly, the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster showed enrichment for several growth factor genes including transforming growth factor \u03b2 (Tgfb1 and Tgfb2), connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/Ctgf), placental growth factor (Pgf), vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) and Wnt5a (Figure 3D). These growth factors have been implicated in various aspects of cancer development and progression including cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor growth and progression. We also observed that Ly6c1high CAFs expressed higher levels of platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), a commonly used CAF marker, whereas platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (Pdgfrb) expression was higher in cells from the \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (Figure S2A).Although small in size, Cd53high (cluster 3), Crabp1high (cluster 4) and Cd74high (cluster 5) clusters also displayed unique gene expression profiles, suggesting that these CAFs may also have distinct functions in the tumor microenvironment (Figure 2A,D). Cells in Cd53high cluster showed significant transcriptional enrichment for desmin (Des), a cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein which plays a crucial role in structural integrity and function of muscle (Figure S2B). Other genes enriched in this cluster included matrix glycoprotein fibronectin 1 (Fn1) which has a well-established role in tumor development and progression, integrin alpha 1 (Itga1), syndecan 1 (Sdc1), matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors Timp1, Timp2 and Timp3 and galectin 3 (Lgals3), a potential regulator of cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, EMT and apoptosis (Figure S2B). Basement membrane collagens Col4a1, Col4a2, Col18a1, laminin A2 (Lama2) and Mmp19, a protease which has been reported to degrade several basement membrane proteins were among the genes highly enriched in the Crabp1high cluster (Figure 3E). This cluster also showed enrichment for perlecan (Hspg2), a major component of basement membranes, ECM proteins lumican (Lum), decorin (Dcn) and spondin 1 (Spon1), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) (Figure S2B). Cells in the Cd74high cluster uniquely expressed high levels of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Eb, Cd74 etc.) which are normally expressed by antigen-presenting cells (Figure 3F). This cluster also expressed commonly used CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1, Col3a1 and Dcn at comparable levels to other CAF clusters confirming that these Cd74high cells are CAFs and not immune cells (Figure S2C). Expression of the pan-CAF markers such as Pdpn, Pdgfra and Dcn were extremely low in immune cells and epithelial cells whereas MHC class II genes were expressed in antigen-presenting immune cells at high levels (Figure S2D). We also detected enrichment for transcripts encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1/S100a4), keratins Krt7, Krt8, Krt14 and Krt18 and claudins Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 in this cluster which were also enriched in epithelial/cancer cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2B,D).2.3. TNBC-Derived CAF Subtypes Share Molecular Features with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC)-Derived CAF SubtypesElyada et al. have previously demonstrated that three distinct CAF subtypes exist in PDAC: 1) \u201cmyofibroblastic CAFs\u201d (myCAFs), that express high levels of \u03b1-SMA and other contractile genes such as Tagln, Myl9 and tropomyosins; 2) \u201cinflammatory CAFs\u201d (iCAFs) which express low levels of \u03b1-SMA but high levels of cytokines and other markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt and Has1; 3) antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) which express MHC class II-related genes and induce T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in CD4+ T cells in an antigen-dependent manner. Here, we compared the profiles of breast and pancreatic tumor-derived CAFs to gain more insights into CAF heterogeneity across different solid tumor types.We reproduced Elyada et al.\u2019s findings using publicly available scRNA-seq data derived from a genetic mouse model of PDAC, the KPC mouse (Kras+/LSL-G12D; Trp53+/LSL-R172H; Pdx-Cre) (GSE129455), and identified the three CAF subtypes (Figure 4A). All of these CAF subtypes expressed pan-CAF markers including Thy1, Pdpn, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4B). The CAF subtypes identified in PDAC included a Ly6c1high cluster (cluster 0) which was identified as iCAFs based on the expression of markers including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 and a \u03b1-SMAhigh cluster (cluster 2) with high expression of Acta2, Tagln, Myl9, Igfbp3 and Tnc which was identified as myCAFs (Figure 4A\u2013C). As in the case for TNBC, PDAC-derived Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) also expressed genes coding for chemokines and other inflammatory mediators such as Il6, Il33, Cxcl1, Cxcl12 and Ccl7 while \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) showed enrichment for growth factors Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3C,D and Figure 4C). We also identified a Cd74high cluster (cluster 1) which was enriched for MHC class II-related genes Cd74, H2-Aa, H2-Ab1 and H2-Eb1 and was identified as apCAFs (Figure 4A,D). Interestingly, in both cancer types Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) showed enrichment for keratins including Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a fibroblast marker (Figure 3F and Figure 4D). A comparative analysis of 4T1- and KPC-derived CAFs further confirmed that iCAFs, myCAFs and apCAFs are highly similar in both breast and pancreatic cancers (Figure S3).Additionally, we generated syngeneic tumors in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by injecting the KPC-derived PDAC cell line mT3, subcutaneously (SQ). Of the ~2500 cells sequenced from an immune-depleted tumor, 434 cells were classified as CAFs, forming two distinct clusters (Figure 4E). Both CAF clusters expressed pan-CAF markers Pdpn, Thy1, Pdgfra and Col1a1 (Figure 4F). Further analysis identified these 2 CAF subtypes as: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) based on enrichment for Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1 and Dpt and 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) based on enrichment for Acta2, Tagln, Tnc and Myl9 (Figure 4G). Interestingly, we did not detect any Cd74high cells in the syngeneic mT3 SQ tumors.Regardless of the tumor type or tumor site, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs) showed enrichment for Il33, Il6, Ccl7, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 whereas \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) expressed high levels of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Ctgf (Figure 3D and Figure 4C,G). This comparative gene expression analysis showed high concordance between Ly6c1high, \u03b1-SMAhigh and Cd74high CAFs in both breast and pancreatic cancers, but points out that SQ tumor models have some limitations.2.4. Cells with Ly6c1high and Cd74high CAF Profiles are Present in Normal, Healthy TissuesTo understand the molecular profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, we isolated Pdgfra-expressing fibroblasts from the mammary fat pads of normal BALB/c mice and performed single-cell sequencing on these cells. The ~1600 sequenced cells clustered in 3 distinct subtypes (Figure 5A). All clusters expressed CAF/fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn, Postn and Col1a1; however, Pdpn and Thy1 expression was more restricted to clusters 0 and 2 (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, clusters 0 and 2 were enriched for markers of Ly6c1high CAFs including Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Has1 and Col14a1, and cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12, although there were some differences in the expression of these genes between these two clusters (Figure 5C,D, Table S3). This suggests that fibroblasts with a Ly6c1high CAF profile exist in normal tissues as well. Clusters 0 and 2 fibroblasts were also enriched for ECM remodeling enzymes including Mmp2, Ctsk, Adamts5 and Htra3 but showed some differences in the expression of core ECM genes (Figure 5E and Figure S4A, Table S3). We did not detect any \u03b1-SMAhigh or Cd74high clusters among normal mammary fibroblasts although an extremely small fraction of cells expressed these genes (Figure 5D). However, none of these cells expressed Cd53 or Crabp1. Cluster 1 showed enrichment for several long non-coding RNAs including maternally expressed 3 (Meg3), nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (Neat1), X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) and metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1) and the expression of Ly6c1high CAF markers were extremely low in this cluster (Figure S4A and Figure 5C).A comparative analysis of fibroblasts derived from normal mammary fat pad and 4T1 tumor-derived CAFs revealed that Ly6c1high CAFs from the tumor share high molecular similarity with Ly6c1high fibroblasts from normal mammary fat pad (Figure S5A\u2013E), expressing common markers such as Ly6c1, Clec3b, Dpt, Ly6a, Htra3, Has1 and Col14a1 (Figure S5A,E). However, transcripts encoding cytokines Cxcl12 and Il33 had a significantly higher expression in the tumor-derived CAFs, suggesting a tumor microenvironment induced activation of these genes in this subpopulation (Figure S5E). Expression of markers of other CAF subtypes were mainly restricted to the tumor (Figure S5D,E).We also analyzed a publicly available normal pancreas scRNA-seq data (GEO: GSM3577882) to determine fibroblast diversity in this tissue. Fibroblasts were identified based on the expression of markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1, Dcn, Col1a1 and Col3a1 and were further analyzed to identify distinct subtypes. In normal pancreas, we identified 3 clusters expressing fibroblast markers (Figure 5F,G). Cluster 0 showed significant enrichment for Ly6c1high inflammatory CAF markers Ly6c1, Clec3b, Has1, Dpt and Col14a1 (Figure 5H,I). Cluster 1 also expressed these markers at some level, and cells in both cluster 0 and 1 transcriptionally expressed cytokines including Ccl2, Ccl7, Il6, Cxcl1 and Cxcl12 (Figure 5I). Cluster 1 also showed enrichment for long noncoding RNAs Meg3, Neat1, Xist and Malat1 that were found to be enriched in a subset of normal mammary fibroblasts (Figure S4A,B). Interestingly, cluster 2 showed enrichment for Cd74 and other genes enriched in Cd74high CAFs including H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Krt8, Krt18 and fibroblast marker Fsp1 (S100a4), suggesting that cells with Cd74high CAF features are also present in the normal pancreas (Figure 5J).Using flow cytometry, we confirmed that Ly6c1high fibroblasts are present in both mammary tumors and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Fibroblasts were isolated by removing immune (anti-CD45) and cancer cells (anti-CD90.1/Thy1.1) and then selecting for cells expressing CAF marker Thy1 (CD90.2/Thy1.2) (Figure 2B). About 2.4% of cells in the tumor and ~30% of cells in the normal mammary fat pad expressed CD90.2/Thy1.2 (Figure 6A\u2013F). About 40% of the cells in this fibroblast-enriched fraction expressed Ly6c in both the tumor and na\u00efve mammary fat pad. Interestingly, a small proportion of these Thy1+ cells expressed MHC class II protein (Figure 6G\u2013I), confirming that cells with Cd74high CAF profile are also present in both tumor and normal mammary tissue. Tumor tissue had a significantly higher proportion of these MHC class II-expressing cells than normal mammary fat pad (Figure 6G\u2013I).3. DiscussionIn this study, we have carried out scRNA-seq of 4T1 mammary and mT3 pancreatic syngeneic tumors to investigate CAF heterogeneity across TNBC and PDAC tumor types. Our study identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with distinct gene expression profiles: 1) Ly6c1high CAFs; 2) \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs; 3) dividing/cycling CAFs; 4) Cd53high CAFs; 5) Crabp1high CAFs and 6) Cd74high CAFs. A comparison of this data to data from KPC mice-derived pancreatic tumors revealed that 3 of these CAF populations, Ly6c1high CAFs (iCAFs), \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) and Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) exist in both tumor types. These 3 CAF subtypes have also been detected in human PDACs.A high proportion of cells in both breast and pancreatic cancers expressed \u03b1-SMA (Acta2). While the existence of myofibroblastic (\u03b1-SMAhigh) CAFs in solid tumors are well-established, the number of \u03b1-SMA-expressing fibroblasts was extremely low in normal breast and pancreatic tissue suggesting that this subtype emerges during tumorigenesis. In 4T1 mammary fat pad tumors, \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs showed enrichment for several growth factor transcripts including Tgfb1, Tgfb2, Ctgf, Pgf, Vegfa and Wnt5a (Figure 2C,D). TGF-\u03b2 is a multifunctional cytokine with a well-established role in fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, EMT and immune regulation. The protein Vegfa is a key regulator of both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Other factors secreted by \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs such as Ctgf, Pgf and Wnt5a have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, EMT and/or angiogenesis, suggesting that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may promote tumor development and progression. Interestingly, a previous study has shown that instead of eradicating the tumor, depletion of myofibroblasts in PDAC caused an increase in tumor invasion; an event associated with decreased survival. These findings suggest that \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs may also function to keep the tumor in check.The Ly6c1high CAFs expressed high levels of transcripts encoding inflammatory cytokines including Ccl2, Il6, Il33 and Cxcl12. Stromal fibroblast derived Ccl2 has been shown to promote tumor progression and contribute to immune evasion. IL6 has been shown to drive EMT, metastasis and therapy resistance in cancer. IL6 is also plays a role in the generation of tumor-associated macrophages by skewing monocyte differentiation into tumor-associated macrophage. It has been shown that Il33 plays a role in tumor growth, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, and evading programmed cell death. Multiple studies have shown that Cxcl12 promotes tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and chemoresistance. Recently, Costa et al. analyzed the expression of six previously known CAF markers (FAP, integrin \u03b21/CD29, \u03b1-SMA, S100-A4/FSP1, PDGFR\u03b2, and CAV1) in human breast cancer and discovered four different CAF subpopulations that expressed these markers at varying levels, including a subtype which promoted immunosuppression through a Cxcl12-dependent mechanism. These studies together suggest that Ly6c1high CAFs may play a role in immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, we found fibroblasts with Ly6c1high CAF profile in normal breast and pancreatic tissues, suggesting that Ly6c1high CAFs might have originated from resident fibroblasts. Alternatively, the resident fibroblasts with high Ly6c1 expression got recruited into the tumor during tumor development. It has been shown that IL1 signaling through IL1R promotes the Ly6c1high CAF (iCAF) phenotype via JAK\u2013STAT signaling and inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling shifts iCAFs to a myofibroblastic phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, Ly6c1high fibroblasts present in normal tissue may differentiate into \u03b1-SMAhigh CAFs (myCAFs) during tumor progression. Further studies are required to understand the specific cues from the tumor microenvironment that drive these phenotypes.The Cd74high CAFs (apCAFs) expressed CD74 and other MHC class II proteins which are normally expressed by antigen presenting cells in the immune system. In addition, Cd74high CAFs showed enrichment for transcripts encoding keratins including Krt7, Krt8 and Krt18 and Fsp1 (S100a4), a protein predominately expressed in fibroblasts. Elyada et al. have shown the presence of apCAFs in both mouse and human PDAC samples. They also showed that apCAFs can present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Another scRNA-seq study showed the presence of a cell population with \u2018apCAF\u2019 profile in normal pancreas and identified it as mesothelial cells. In normal pancreas, these cells expressed Pdpn but, lacked Pdgfra expression. Here we showed that cells with apCAF profile are present in both normal mammary tissue and mammary tumors. In breast/pancreatic tumors and normal breast/pancreatic tissues, Cd74high cells expressed fibroblast marker Fsp1/S100a4 (Figure 3F, Figure 4D and Figure 5J) whereas Pdgfra expression appeared to be restricted to tumor tissue only (Figure S2C, Figure 4B and Figure 5G). Future labeling and lineage tracing experiments will be able to conclusively determine the origin of these cells. It has been hypothesized that apCAFs might have an immune modulatory role in the tumor microenvironment, and the possibility exists that these cells also protect healthy tissue from auto-immune reactions in conditions such as lupus or pancreatitis.Recently, using scRNA-seq, Bartoschek et al. identified four transcriptionally distinct subpopulations of CAFs known as vascular CAFs (vCAFs), matrix CAFs (mCAFs), developmental CAFs (dCAFs) and cycling CAFs (cCAFs) in the genetically engineered MMTV-PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. The vCAFs showed enrichment for several genes involved in vascular development including Mcam and Rgs5 and likely have a perivascular origin. Upon re-analysis of this data we detected enrichment for myofibroblast markers Acta2, Tagln, Myl9 and Tpm2 in vCAFs, suggesting that some of these cells acquired a myofibroblastic molecular profile (Figure S6A\u2013C). It was suggested that mCAFs originate from resident fibroblasts, and the proportion of mCAFs decrease with tumor progression. We found that mCAFs were enriched for Crabp1 and several other markers of Crabp1high CAFs from 4T1 tumors including Lama2, Spon1, Dcn, Lum and Mmp19. We also detected weak Ly6c1 expression in MMTV-PyMT-derived mCAFs raising the possibility that mCAFs (Crabp1high) might have originated from Ly6c1high fibroblasts (Figure S6B). In agreement with this, Crabp1high CAFs resided adjacent to Ly6c1high CAFs on the pseudotemporal trajectory (Figure 2E). Further studies are required to understand specific functions of Crabp1high CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. However, we did not detect any Cd74high CAF clusters in this dataset. Cd53high CAFs were also not identified in this dataset or in the KPC model of pancreatic cancer. However, we could identify Cd53high CAFs in our initial 4T1 scRNA-seq data (Figure S6D\u2013F). Future studies will determine whether Cd53high CAFs are a subtype with distinct origin and function or merely represent a transitional state during the differentiation of CAFs.To our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively compares CAF heterogeneity in multiple tumor types in parallel to the healthy, tissue of origin, using a single cell RNA sequencing approach. We have identified six CAF subtypes in TNBC with unique transcriptomic profiles, adding several subtypes to some that have been widely described in the literature. Our findings, in line with numerous other studies, suggest that specific cues from the microenvironment are necessary to maintain these unique molecular features; many of these subtypes have been shown to acquire a myofibroblasts-like phenotype when cultured in 2D or 3D. A major limitation of our study is that we only examined tumors at one timepoint. It is possible that these populations shift as the tumor grows in size, as it acquires resistance to therapy, or as it metastasizes. Future studies should aim to compare multiple tumor types and stages to further refine our understanding of CAF heterogeneity in solid tumors as well as to begin to elucidate individual contributions to tumor function.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell Lines4T1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The 4T1-Thy1.1 cell line was graciously provided as a gift from Dr. Julian Lum. 4T1-Thy1.1 cells express a non-native isoform of Thy1, Thy1.1 (CD90.1) which differs from native isoform Thy1.2 (CD90.2) in one amino acid. The mT3 cell line was developed from organoids isolated from KPC mouse PDAC lesions. The cell line is syngeneic and forms tumors in immune-competent C57BL/6 mice.4.2. Generation of Orthotopic Mammary Tumors and Tumor Digestion10-week-old female BALB/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were injected with 25,000 4T1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) or 4T1-Thy1.1 cells in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into mammary fat pad (MFP) to establish tumors. Mice were euthanized 19\u201326 days post injection and the tumors were dissected from these mice. Single cell suspensions were generated by passing the tumor through a syringe without a needle followed by a 1h digest with shaking at 37 \u00b0C in 100 \u03bcg/mL DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 11284932001), 300 U/mL collagenase/100U/mL hyaluronidase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada; catalog no. 07912), 0.6 U/mL Dispase II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; catalog no. 4942078001) in DMEM/D12 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Digests were filtered through a 100 \u00b5m cell strainer prior to debris removal (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; catalog no. 130-109-398) and resuspended in BD FACS Pre-Sort Buffer (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; catalog no. 563503) followed by red blood cell lysis (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA; catalog no. A1049201) prior to downstream applications. All animal experimental procedures were completed under an approved institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) protocol at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and conforming to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.4.3. Single Cell Sequencing of 4T1 Tumors and Data Analysis4T1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed and cell suspension was prepared as described above. Two subsequent washes in sterile PBS + 0.04% non-acetylated bovine serum albumin were performed to further remove debris from final suspension. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS with 0.04% non-acetylated BSA prior to single cell sequencing preparation using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10 Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol. scRNA-Seq libraries were sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500.The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3\u2032gene counting. Samples were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using \u201ccellranger mkfastq\u201d with default parameters. Unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts were generated using \u201ccellranger count\u201d. Further analysis was performed in R using the Seurat package. First, cells with fewer than 500 detected genes per cell and genes that were expressed by fewer than 5 cells were filtered out. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 7800 measured genes were filtered out. Dead cells were excluded by retaining cells with less than 5% mitochondrial reads. After removing all the unwanted cells from the dataset, we normalized the data by employing a global-scaling normalization method \u201cLogNormalize\u201d. Subsequently, we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled to a mean of 0 and variance of 1 and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal component analysis (PCA) using the previously determined 2000 variable genes. Subsequently, we constructed a K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph based on the Euclidean distance in PCA space using the \u201cFindNeighbors\u201d function (using dimensions 1 to 15) and applied Louvain algorithm to iteratively group cells together by \u201cFindClusters\u201d function (resolution = 0.3). A non-linear dimensional reduction was then performed via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) using the first 15 principle components. A total of 12 clusters were identified in the 4T1 scRNA-seq data. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.4. Single Cell Sequencing and Analysis of Stromal Cell-Enriched Fraction4T1-Thy1.1 tumor from a female BALB/c mouse was processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. To enrich for stromal cells in the sample, immune cells and Thy1.1 expressing cancer cells were removed from the single cell suspension using magnetic cell separation with CD90.1 and CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-121-273 and 130-052-301, respectively) depletion in combination with LS magnetic separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-042-401). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u2032 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; Catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500 at median sequencing depth of ~30,000 reads.The scRNA-seq data was analyzed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types were identified. Clusters with high expression of Ptprc and Epcam were regarded as contaminants of immune cells and cancer cells, respectively and were discarded from subsequent analysis. Clusters with high expression of Pecam1 and Rgs5 were identified as endothelial cells and pericytes, respectively and were also discarded from further analysis. Resulting clusters showed enrichment for CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1, Col1a1 and Dcn. Raw expression values were obtained for cells in these clusters and were further analyzed using Seurat as described above. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5800 measured genes were filtered out. Subsequently, after performing a log-normalization we identified the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset. The data was then scaled, and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by PCA. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells and the Louvain algorithm as described above. Subsequently, a dimensional reduction was performed via UMAP as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. We subsequently repeated this analysis by varying the number of variable genes used for dimensionality reduction to further confirm the presence of these CAF subtypes in 4T1 tumors. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.5. Single-Cell Sequencing of Syngeneic mT3 Tumors and Data AnalysisTo generate mT3 tumor, 10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with 25,000 mT3 cells subcutaneously (SQ) into the back flank in a 1:1 suspension of Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY, USA; Catalog no. 354234) and PBS. At 3 weeks post injection the tumor was dissected and processed as described above to obtain single cell suspensions. Subsequently, immune cells and blood cells were removed by CD45+ magnetic bead-based depletion (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany; Catalog no. 130-052-301) and ACK lysis buffer (ACK lysis buffer, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA catalog no. A1049201), respectively, following manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Remaining cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) NextSeq 500. The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat as described above and clusters of various cell types including cancer cells and CAFs were identified. Clusters expressing CAF markers Pdpn, Pdgfra, Thy1 and Dcn were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat as described above and various CAF subtypes were identified. Raw count matrix is available online in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).4.6. Isolation and Sequencing of Fibroblasts from Normal Mammary Fat PadFourth and fifth mammary fat pads were collected from four BALBc mice, aged approximately 12 weeks. Tissue was minced and then digested in 50 mL RPMI with 10% heat inactivated (HI) FBS and Penicillin-Streptomycin and 1 mg/mL Collagenase IV (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). After an hour, the suspension was strained using a 70 \u00b5m cell strainer and centrifuged at 500\u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL ACK (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for five minutes. 10 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS was added and the cells were spun down at 500\u00d7 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of PBS with 1% HI FBS. To identify fibroblasts, cells were stained with the following antibodies at a 1:100 dilution: anti-CD326 (FITC, clone G8.8, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD45 (APC-Cy7, clone 30-F11, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD140a (Super Bright 436, clone APA5, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA), and 7AAD to assess viability. Cells were then sorted on a BD Aria to gate for CD140a+ EPCAM\u2212 CD45\u2212 7AAD\u2212 cells (fibroblasts). Cells were prepared for single cell sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3\u02b9 GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA; catalog no. 1000075) on a 10x Genomics Chromium Controller following manufacturers protocol and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500.The scRNA-seq data was demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) as described above to obtain UMI counts. Subsequent analysis was performed in Seurat. To remove noise from droplets containing more than one cell, cells with more 5900 measured genes were filtered out. All the other filtering steps and data normalization were performed as described above for 4T1 tumors. Prior to PCA, we identified the 2000 most variable genes and PCA was performed in this gene space. Clusters of cells were identified on the basis of a shared-nearest neighbor graph between cells as described above. First 15 principal components were provided as an input for dimensionality reduction via UMAP. Raw count matrix is available online at in Dryad data repository (, doi:10.6071/M3238R).Comparative analysis of normal mammary fibroblasts and 4T1tumor-derived CAFs was performed using Seurat. The data was pre-processed and normalized as described above and 2000 most variable features were identified. Subsequently, integration anchors were identified using \u2018FindIntegrationAnchors\u2019 function and both datasets were integrated to generate a new integrated dataset. The integrated data was scaled, dimensionality was reduced, and the data was further analyzed as described above to identify clusters of CAF-subtypes.4.7. Analysis of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts from Mouse Pancreatic TumorsFibroblast-enriched scRNA-seq data from PDAC tumors of 4 KPC mice were obtained from GEO (GSE129455) as log transformed gene-by-cell count matrix. Subsequent data analysis was carried out in R with Seurat as described above and various cell types were identified. Clusters of cells expressing CAF markers Pdgfra, Pdpn, Thy1 and Col1a1 were further analyzed and various CAF subpopulations were identified. Comparative analysis of 4T1 tumor-derived and PDAC-derived CAFs were performed using Seurat as described above.4.8. Analysis of Normal Fibroblasts from Mouse PancreasFrom GEO (GSE125588) we obtained processed scRNA-seq files (barcodes.tsv, genes.tsv and matrix.mtx generated by Cell Ranger) associated with normal pancreas. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various cell types. Clusters of cells expressing fibroblast markers Pdgfra, Dcn and Col1a1 were extracted and further analyzed using Seurat to identify various fibroblast subpopulations.4.9. Analysis of Mammary Tumors from MMTV-PyMT MicescRNA-seq data for fibroblasts isolated from mammary tumors of two MMTV-PyMT mice were obtained from GEO (GSE111229) as raw counts. The data was analyzed using Seurat as described above to identify various CAF subtypes. vCAFs, mCAFs, cCAFs and dCAFs were identified based on previously established markers.4.10. Trajectory FindingSingle-cell pseudotime trajectories of CAFs were constructed with Monocle. Expression data, phenotype data, and feature data were extracted from the Seurat object and a Monocle \u201cCellDataSet\u201d object was constructed using the \u201cnewCellDataSet\u201d function. Highly variable genes from Seurat object were used as ordering genes. Dimensionality reduction was performed using the DDRTree algorithm implemented Monocle via the \u201creduceDimension\u201d function. Cells were ordered along the trajectory using the \u201corderCells\u201d method with default parameters.4.11. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Inflammatory and MHC Class II-Expressing FibroblastsSingle cell suspensions of normal mammary fat pads (n = 6) or 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c fat pads (n = 5) were generated as described above. Antibody staining was performed by incubating the cells with 1:100 dilution of APC/Cyanine7 anti-mouse I-A/I-E (MHC class II), Brilliant Violet 421\u2122 anti-mouse CD90.2, PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-rat CD90/mouse CD90.1 (Thy-1.1), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse CD45, FITC anti-mouse Ly-6C (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog no. 107627, 105341, 202515, 103131, 128005, respectively) for 30 min prior to resuspension in PBS with 1% FBS and 7-AAD Viability Staining Solution (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA; Catalog No. 420403). Cells were then analyzed on a BD (San Jose, CA, USA) FACSMelody instrument. Viable fibroblasts populations were identified as 7AAD\u2212/CD45\u2212/CD90.1\u2212/CD90.2+ cells. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software (v10.6.2).5. ConclusionsThis study systematically examined CAF heterogeneity in TNBCs and uncovered several CAF subpopulations in mammary tumor microenvironment. A comparison of breast and pancreatic-tumor-derived CAFs revealed that myofibroblast-like CAFs, inflammatory CAFs and MHC class II-expressing CAFs share similar molecular profiles in both tumor types. Our study also suggests that inflammatory fibroblasts and MHC class II-expressing fibroblasts are endogenous to healthy tissues, suggesting that these fibroblast subtypes are not induced by the tumor microenvironment but, are likely recruited to the tumor during tumor development. Further studies are required determine the specific functions of these CAF subpopulations in tumor development and progression. Effectively targeting these CAF subtypes could prevent cancer progression.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: Single-cell sequencing of immune depleted stromal cell fraction, Figure S2: Markers of various CAF subtypes, Figure S3: Comparative analysis of 4T1-derived CAFs (BC) and KPC -derived CAFs (PDAC), Figure S4: Expression profiles of tissue resident fibroblasts, Figure S5: Comparative analysis of breast cancer-derived CAFs and normal mammary fat pad-derived fibroblasts, Figure S6: Identification Crabp1high and Cd53high CAFs in multiple breast cancer datasets, Table S1:Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived cluster compared to all other clusters, Table S2: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each 4T1 tumor-derived CAF cluster compared to all other CAF clusters, Table S3: Genes enriched (fold change >1.25) in each normal mammary fibroblast cluster compared to all other clusters.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.S. and G.G.L.; data acquisition, N.R.H., S.F.G., K.A.M., A.S.; formal analysis, A.S.; writing A.S. and G.G.L.; resource sharing S.W.B., I.P.; project administration, E.K.W. and M.A.C.

        "content": "An inherent problem in breast cancer treatment is that current therapeutic approaches fail to specifically target the dissemination of breast cancer cells from the primary tumor. Clinical findings show that the loss of Wnt-5a protein expression in the primary breast tumor predicts a faster tumor spread, and in vitro analyses reveal that it does so by inhibiting tumor cell migration. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reconstitution of Wnt-5a signaling could be a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit breast cancer metastasis. We used in vitro techniques to show that 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells responded to the reconstitution of Wnt-5a signaling using our novel Wnt-5a mimicking hexapeptide, Foxy-5, in the same way as human breast cancer cells. Therefore, we could subsequently study its effect in vivo on the metastatic spread of cancer following the inoculation of 4T1 cells into mice. In vitro analyses revealed that both recombinant Wnt-5a and the Wnt-5a-derived Foxy-5 peptide impaired migration and invasion without affecting apoptosis or proliferation of 4T1 breast cancer cells. The in vivo experiments show that i.p. injections of Foxy-5 inhibited metastasis of inoculated 4T1 breast cancer cells from the mammary fat pad to the lungs and liver by 70% to 90%. These data provide proof of principle that the reconstitution of Wnt-5a signaling in breast cancer cells is a novel approach to impair breast tumor metastasis by targeting cell motility. In combination with existing therapies, this approach represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer patients.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the tumor microenvironment and have been shown to promote cancer aggressiveness. In our previous study, analysis of expression profiles obtained from paired CAFs and normal fibroblasts from colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue revealed that gene sets related to the Wnt signaling pathway were highly enriched in colorectal CAFs. Furthermore, among the components of the \u03b2-catenin-independent Wnt pathway, Wnt5a was highly expressed in CAFs. Since Wnt5a is considered to be a regulator of CRC progression in CAFs, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on Wnt5a in 171 patients who underwent surgery for CRC. Positive staining for Wnt5a was often found in cancer stroma, particularly in fibromatous areas, although the immunoreactivity for Wnt5a was weak in cancer cells. Wnt5a status in CAFs was significantly associated with tumor size, depth of invasion, lymphatic and vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, and recurrence. Subsequent in\u00a0vitro analyses using human recombinant Wnt5a protein revealed that cancer cell proliferation and migration were significantly increased by stimulation with Wnt5a. Our findings suggest that Wnt5a-derived CAFs play a crucial role in CRC progression and have potential as a target of anti-cancer therapies.",

        "content": "Tumor metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have tropism towards tumor tissues, and can be converted into tumor-associated mesenchymal stromal cells (TA-MSCs) to facilitate TNBC metastasis through interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and unclear, and effective strategies to suppress tumor metastasis via eliminating TA-MSCs are still lacking. Here, we demonstrate that fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP\u03b1) was overexpressed in TA-MSCs, which prompts TA-MSCs to secrete multiple C-C motif chemokine ligands, promoting C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and facilitating TAM polarization into the M2 phenotype, thereby promoting TNBC pulmonary metastasis. Z-GP-DAVLBH, an FAP\u03b1-activated vinblastine prodrug, induces FAP\u03b1<sup+</sup TA-MSC apoptosis, which significantly suppresses CCR2<sup+</sup TAM recruitment and polarization, thus inhibiting pulmonary metastasis of orthotopic TNBC cell-derived xenografts and patient-derived xenografts. This study provides insight into an important role of FAP\u03b1 in mediating TA-MSC-induced TNBC metastasis and provides compelling evidence that targeting TA-MSCs with an FAP\u03b1-activated prodrug is a promising strategy for suppressing TNBC metastasis.",

IntroductionTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for around 10\u201320% of invasive breast cancers. Its aggressive behavior and lack of specific treatment contribute to the highest mortality among all breast cancer subtypes, which is estimated at around 20%. TNBC is characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and by the lack of human epidermal growth factor (HER2) amplification/overexpression, therefore reducing the options of targeted therapies.Recent findings propose cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a potential therapy target for breast cancer (BC). CAFs are spindled-shaped cells, and as the most abundant cell type in the tumor microenvironment, they interact closely with cancer cells and contribute to tumorigenesis. Activated fibroblasts within the tumor exhibit enhanced proliferation, migration, and elevated secretion levels of chemokines and growth factors. The emerging evidence suggests that CAF populations are highly heterogeneous because of their various origins, including residual quiescent fibroblasts, pericytes, or bone marrow-derived progenitor cells. CAF subpopulations are known to exert different, sometimes contradictory roles in cancer. For example, CD146pos CAFs in ER-positive BC maintain ER expression in cancer cells and sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment, whereas CD146neg CAFs suppress the expression of ER and promote tamoxifen resistance. In TNBC, stroma-rich tumors in hematoxylin and eosin staining were correlated with a shorter relapse-free period and poor overall survival. They were also an independent prognostic factor for the total group of patients in the study.Interestingly, ER itself can be expressed by CAFs, what has functional consequences. In prostate cancer (PCa), ER-positive CAFs correlated with better patient outcomes and lower invasiveness, which is linked to the downregulation of MMP3. ER-positive CAFs also suppress PCa cell invasion by the reduction of CCL5 and IL-6 secretion, as well as macrophage infiltration. A study by Da et al. indicated the pro-proliferative action of ER-positive CAFs in PCa in vitro and in a mouse model. In cervical cancer, an estrogen receptor was also described as a modulator of CAF function. ER-antagonists (fulvestrant and methyl piperidino pyrazole) downregulated the expression of genes associated with cell cycle and metabolism in CAFs, which affected tumor progression. In breast cancer, however, there are no data about the ER role in CAFs. Hence, exploring this marker also in tumor stroma may open further opportunities for cancer treatment.ER\u03b136 is an alternative estrogen receptor alpha isoform coded by the ESR1 gene. It lacks transcriptional activation domains but retains the DNA-binding domain. In breast cancer, ER\u03b136 is described as a rapid activator of non-genomic ER signalization via the MAPK signaling pathway, which leads to uncontrolled proliferation and anti-apoptotic events. Our previous study showed that a high expression of ER\u03b136 is an unfavorable prognostic factor in breast cancers, also in the ER-negative group. At the same time, 22% of stromal cells in ER-negative cancers were positive for ER\u03b136. Therefore, we decided to investigate the role of ER\u03b136 in the most abundant stromal cells in breast cancer\u2014cancer-associated fibroblasts\u2014to check if they might play a role in engaging malignant phenotype in one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes\u2014triple-negative cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Cell Lines, Antibodies, and ReagentsMDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were passaged for a maximum of 3 to 4 months post-resuscitation and routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All the media and their supplements were purchased from GE Healthcare HyClone or Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA). All the cells were cultured up to 90\u201395% confluency and the media were changed every 2\u20133 days. The following antibodies were purchased: from Cell Signaling Technology\u2014anti-c-Met-Tyr1234/1235 (#3077), anti-c-Met (#4560), anti-Akt-Ser473 (#4058), anti-Akt (#9272), anti-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204 (#9101), anti-ERK (#4695); from Dako Agilent\u2014anti \u03b1SMA (IR611), from Novus Biologicals\u2014anti-vimentin (NBP1\u201331327), from Cell Applications\u2014anti-ER\u03b136 (CY-1109), from BD\u2014anti-E-cadherin (Clone 36, 610181), from Abcam\u2014secondary anti-rabbit IgG DyLight 488 (ab96883), secondary anti-mouse IgG DyLight 594 (ab96873), from Sigma Aldrich\u2014\u03b2-actin (AC-15) secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated (A9169), secondary anti-mouse HRP-conjugated (A9044). Cytokines were purchased from STI\u2013VEGF (CYT-10\u201310), IL-8 (chm-231-a), HGF (cyt-090-a), GM-CSM (cyt-221-a), CXCL1 (100\u2013031S), and Peprotech-CXCL5 (300\u201322). HGFR inhibitor-capmatinib were purchased from Selleckchem (Cat. No. S2788).2.2. Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Isolation and Conditioned Media PreparationTumor tissues were collected from patients treated at the Medical University of Gdansk. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk (NKBBN 94/2017). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The tissue was collected into cold DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and an antimycotic/antibiotic mix (Sigma Aldrich, A5955) and stored at 2\u20138 \u00b0C until ready for processing, but for no longer than 4 h. After mincing, the tissue was digested in 0.35 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, C2674) and 0.35 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich, H3506) solution in PBS for 1 h with rotation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Then, the suspension was centrifuged 400\u00d7 g for 5 min, the pellet was suspended in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antimycotic/antibiotic mix and transferred to the cell culture dish. The CAFs were serially trypsinized to continually reduce the tumor cell populations. The serial trypsinization method utilizes the differences in the detachment times of various cell types, CAFs detach from the tissue culture-treated plastic faster than cancer cells, and after 2\u20133 passages, CAF culture should be homogeneous. The homogeneity was checked by immunofluorescence staining using CAF markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA), and tumor cells marker\u2014E-cadherin as a control. All CAF experiments were conducted using cells between the 3rd and 10th passages. For the conditioned media collections, the media was changed in the cell cultures with 70\u201380% confluency and collected after 72 h. Media from different pass times were collected, frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C, and mixed before use to assure consistency.2.3. Immunofluorescence StainingCells were seeded on the sterilized cover glass and, after 24 h, were fixed and permeabilized using a methanol/acetone mix for 15 min. For blocking, 5% BSA in PBS was used. Primary antibodies were diluted in Antibody Diluent (Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and incubated with cells for 30 min. Imaging was performed using an Olympus IX83 fluorescent microscope and CellSens Imaging Software (Olympus Life Science, Waltham, MA, USA).2.4. Western BlottingCell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). SDS-PAGE was performed using TGX gels for 1 h and 250 V (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), then the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane by semi-dry transfer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) and Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Amersham) were used to visualize specific protein bands. Original images about western blotting can be found at Supplementary Materials, File S1. 2.5. Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Secretome AnalysisCytokine detection in the CAF-conditioned media was performed using a Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. For this experiment, phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS was used.2.6. Cell Migration AssayTwo hundred thousand MDA-MB_231 cells were seeded into a Boyden chamber with 8\u00b5m pores and inserted into the well with the CAF-conditioned media. The cells were incubated for 16 h. Then cells from the inner side of the chamber were scrubbed off, and the cells on the other side were stained with Hoechst. Migrated cells were observed using a fluorescent microscope.2.7. Analysis of Cell Growth in Three-Dimensional CulturesThe cells (1.5 \u00d7 103 MDA-MB-231 or 2 \u00d7 103 Hs 578T) were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L of growth factor-reduced matrigel mixed 1:1 with medium and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C for up to 60 min to solidify. Two drops of cell suspension were plated on a tissue culture plate for each sample. Solidified matrigel drops were covered with the appropriate growth media with or without supplementation. The medium was replaced every third day. Pictures were taken between days 7 and 14. For all 3D culture experiments, representative pictures were taken using an Olympus IX83 microscope. To evaluate the number of cell colonies branching, three independent visual fields were investigated for each drop, six for each sample. Conditioned media from the CAF cultures were used to analyze the effect of CAFs on MDA-MB-231 invasiveness. Media supplemented with appropriate cytokines were used to detect the one that is responsible for that phenotype. All 3D experiments were performed in triplicate, and the means from all the experiments are shown in graphs.2.8. Stimulation with CAF-Conditioned Media and HGF, Signaling Analysis, and Inhibitory EffectsFor the analysis of signaling triggered by ER\u03b136high CAFs, cells were routinely starved overnight in serum-free media. Where required, the media were supplemented with a c-Met inhibitor\u2014capmatinib (50 nM)\u2014for 2 h prior to stimulation. The cells were then stimulated with CAFs4-conditioned medium or HGF (10 ng/mL) for indicated time periods. All stimulations were performed in triplicate.2.9. Clinical Data AnalysisA total of 103 primary tumors from breast cancer patients (stages I\u2013III) treated at the Medical University of Gdansk were investigated. Their detailed clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The study was granted permission from the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Gdansk.2.10. ER\u03b136 Protein Levels in Tumor StromaTissue microarrays (TMA) were prepared by sampling up to five non-adjacent tissue cores 1 mm in diameter from each formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor. Serial sections were analyzed by manual immunohistochemical staining with commercially available rabbit antibodies against ER\u03b136 specific to the unique C-terminal sequence (Cell Applications Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, Cat# CY-1109; dilution, 1:800; incubation time, 1 h). Secondary anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used together with the Novolink Max-Polymer Detection System (Leica Novocastra, Wetzlar, Germany) for the detection of the ER\u03b136 protein. The intensity and the percentage of positively stained fibroblasts were evaluated; since the intensity (score of 1\u20133) was equal in all samples (2), only the percentage was taken into consideration.2.11. Hormone Receptors and HER2 Status Analysis in Breast Cancer SamplesER (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone SP1, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), PgR (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 1E2, Roche), and HER2 (rabbit monoclonal antibody, clone 4B5, Roche) were analyzed on the whole slides during the standard pathological assessment of the tumors. TMA, prepared as described above, from PT and LNM were used for SMA (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 1A4, Dako Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and antigen retrieval and staining were performed on the automatic devices: BenchMark GX (Roche) for ER, PgR, and HER2 staining, and DAKO AutostainerLink48 (Dako Agilent) for EpCAM and SMA staining. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were omitted. ER, PgR, and HER2 were detected using the UltraView DAB Benchmark XT system (Roche), EpCAM, and SMA with EnVision\u2122 FLEX Dako Autostainer (Dako Agilent). SNAIL staining was performed manually.2.12. Statistical AnalysisThe in vitro data were analyzed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For multiple comparison, Tukey\u2019s test was used. For simple comparison of two normally distributed datasets, Student\u2019s t test was used. Clinical data analysis was performed using Statistica version 12 (StatSoft Dell, Round Rock, TX, USA) software and SPSS Software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were compared by the \u03c72 test. Continuous variables were compared by Spearman\u2019s rank order test. The Mann\u2013Whitney test was used to examine the differences between continuous values in two groups. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves for disease-free survival and overall survival were compared using an F-Cox test.2.13. RNA ExtractionRNA was isolated from the CAFs using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The RNA extraction from FFPE breast tumor samples was performed as described.2.14. nCounter Gene Expression AssayThe CAFs and FFPE RNA samples were analyzed in separate batches. RNA extracted from CAFs (300 ng) was subjected to expression profiling with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures for hybridization, detection, and scanning. RNA extracted from FFPE tissues was processed as described.2.15. NanoString Data ProcessingThe CAFs and FFPE RNA data were processed in separate batches. For each sample, background correction and normalization were performed using nSolver 4.0 software, as previously described. In brief, the background level was estimated by thresholding over the mean plus 2 standard deviations of the negative control counts. Subsequently, the data were normalized according to the global mean of the counts of positive controls and the most stably expressed housekeeping genes (expression stability assessed with NormFinder)\u20144 in the FFPE group (SD range of 173.5\u2013228.4 counts) and 18 in the CAF group (SD range of 2.9\u201366.9 counts). The negative and positive control probes were included in the assay. Following normalization, low-expression genes (log2 mean count in all samples <4 for the CAF dataset and < 6 for the FFPE dataset) were excluded, leaving 326 transcripts in the CAF dataset and 584 transcripts in the FFPE dataset for further analysis. Genes differentiating between ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low tumors were selected based on the logarithmic fold change (logFC) calculated for the median normalized counts of each probe in the compared groups. Genes with logFC > 1 were considered upregulated; genes with logFC < \u22121 were considered downregulated. The differences were estimated with the Mann\u2013Whitney U Test. The data were analyzed using the R statistical environment (3.6.1).3. Results3.1. CAFs Characterized by Different ER\u03b136 Expression Represent Distinct Subpopulations with Diverse Influence on TNBC CellsFour CAF cell lines were isolated from primary breast tumors (for details, see Section 2). After 3 passages, the cells were checked for CAFs and cancer cell markers\u2014vimentin (VIM), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), and E-cadherin (E-CAD\u2014by immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. All obtained CAF cell lines were stained positively for VIM and negatively for E-CAD. In terms of \u03b1-SMA, we observed heterogeneity between the obtained cell lines as well as within cells in particular cell lines (Supplementary Materials, Figure S1).The obtained CAF cell lines were stained with a monoclonal anti-ER\u03b136 antibody. Two lines, CAF3 and CAF4, showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity than the CAF1 and CAF2 lines (Figure 1A). Thus, we classified the CAF1 and CAF2 lines as ER\u03b136low and the CAF3 and CAF4 lines as ER\u03b136high. Knowing that CAF subpopulations may differ in gene expression as well as in modulation of the immune microenvironment of the tumor, we decided to analyze both CAF subpopulations with an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. We found significant differences in gene expression between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF subpopulations. In total, 41 genes were found to be upregulated (logFC > 1, FC\u2014fold change, the ratio between the ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low samples), and 35 were downregulated (logFC < \u22121) in ER\u03b136high when compared to ER\u03b136low CAFs. The most upregulated genes in ER\u03b136high CAFs were CXCL3, IL1A, IL1B, CXCL6, and NEFL, while the most downregulated genes were NFATC2, RUNX3, ITGB2, BST2, and KIT (Figure 1B, Supplementary Data 1).Differences in the gene expressions of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAFs suggest that the subpopulations may also differ in the secretome profiles. Indeed, as revealed by analysis using a Human Cytokine XL Profiler, ER\u03b136high CAFs secreted significantly higher amounts of CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF (Figure 1C). All those cytokines are linked with tumor progression and invasion; therefore, we tested the influence of CAF secretomes on the 3D growth of triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Conditioned media obtained from ER\u03b136high CAFs significantly increased the formation of the branching colonies in growth factor-reduced matrigel (3 and 3.8 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs 16.6 and 19.7 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4; Figure 1D). To confirm our findings, we tested CAF-conditioned media on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T (Supplementary Materials, Figure S2) and observed a similar effect. ER\u03b136-negative CAF-conditioned media induced the branching of the cells in a slower manner than ER\u03b136-positive CAFs (7.5 and 6.2 branching colonies/visible field for ER\u03b136low CAF1 and CAF2, respectively, vs. 15.9 and 15.9 for ER\u03b136high CAF3 and CAF4, respectively). Furthermore, we analyzed the influence of CAF-conditioned media on cell migration. All CAF-conditioned media induced the migration through the Boyden chamber, but with no significant differences between the CAF subtypes (Supplementary Materials, Figure S3).3.2. HFG Secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs Induces Invasive Phenotype of TNBC CellsTaking into consideration the differences in the profiles of ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low CAF-secreted cytokines, we decided to determine which cytokines are responsible for cell branching in 3D matrigel culture. We tested six cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-8, GM-CSF, VEGF, and HGF) in two concentrations, 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL, and counted the number of branching colonies per field view. We observed that at both concentrations, only HGF significantly induced colony branching compared to the control (mean of 3.7 colonies/visible field for control vs 14.9 and 26.9 for 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL HGF, respectively, p < 0.001, Figure 2). HGF at a 50 ng/mL concentration also significantly increased the number of branching colonies compared to 10 ng/mL HGF (14.9 vs 26.9, p < 0.001, Figure 2). The results were confirmed on another TNBC cell line\u2014Hs 578T. HGF in both concentrations significantly induced branching of the colonies when compared to the control (8.5 vs. 55.9 for 10 ng/mL, p < 0.0001; 8.5 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the 10 ng/mL HGF treatment and 50 ng/mL (55.9 vs. 71.2, p < 0.0001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S4).Next, we analyzed if the HGF receptor (c-Met, HGFR) is involved in the stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cell branching by conditioned media from CAF cultures. To test this, we used a lower HGF concentration (10 ng/mL, as it still significantly induced colony branching) and c-Met inhibitor-capmatinib. In the 3D matrigel cultures, both HGF and conditioned media from CAF4 culture increased the number of branching colonies (11.75 for HGF and 15.83 for CAF4) in comparison to the control (2.25), and the effect was abolished upon capmatinib treatment of both the HGF group (11.75 for HGF vs. 1.92 colonies for HGF + capmatinib p = 0.002) and the CAF4 conditioned media group (15.83 for CAFs vs. 7.17 colonies for CAF4 + capmatinib, p = 0.003. Figure 3A,B). Similarly, in the Hs 578T cell line treated with HGF in the presence of capmatinib, a decrease in branching colonies was observed (55.9 vs 6.7, p < 0.0001), as well as for the treatment with CAF4-conditioned media with or without 50 nM capmatinib (5.0 vs. 24.1, p < 0.001, Supplementary Materials, Figure S5). The above results strongly suggest the involvement of the c-Met signaling pathway in the ER\u03b136high CAF-mediated induction of MDA-MB-231 colony branching. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of c-Met-related downstream proteins: AKT, FAK, Paxillin, and Scr (Supplementary Materials, Figure S6). We found that both HGF and CAF4-conditioned media induced the phosphorylation of c-Met as well as AKT, which was affected by pretreatment with capmatinib (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, the obtained results suggest that ER\u03b136high CAF subtypes secrete HGF, which induces an invasive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro via the c-Met-AKT pathway.3.3. ER\u03b136high CAFs in Tumor Stroma Correlates with Proliferation and TAMs MarkersWe analyzed by IHC the levels of ER\u03b136 isoform in tumor stromal cells in 103 FFPE breast cancer samples. The mean percentage of positively stained cells was 22.3% (range of 5\u201362%), and the samples were classified as positive if the percentage of ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells was higher than 12% (cut-off level set at lower quartile value). As a result, 69.1% of all samples were ER\u03b136-positive (representative pictures in Supplementary Materials, Figure S7). We found that ER\u03b136-positive stroma cells correlated positively with Ki67 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041), CXCR4 (median values of 100 vs. 200, p = 0.002), CD68 (median values of 30 vs. 40, p = 0.041), and CD163 (median values of 10 vs. 20, p = 0.041) protein levels measured by IHC (Figure 4A\u2013D).3.4. Cytokines Produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs Confer Poor Prognosis of TNBC PatientsKnowing that ER\u03b136high CAFs induce an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro, ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts were correlated with clinicopathological data, and protein markers were associated with EMT, stemness, and stroma composition, previously characterized by our team. There was no correlation between the ER\u03b136 protein expression and the stage, grade, lymph node status, molecular subtype, or histological type (Table 1) of the analyzed breast tumors. We also found no association between ER\u03b136-positive CAFs and the overall survival of TNBC patients in our group (N = 15, p = 0.47, Supplementary Materials, Figure S8). However, the survival analysis might be strongly affected by the very small sample size (N = 14). Taking into consideration that ER\u03b136 isoform expression data are not available in open access databases, we decided to explore the effect of cytokines expressed by ER\u03b136high CAFs on disease-free survival in TNBC using a TCGA database. For all of them, we used the upper quartile cutoff and found that only a high expression of HGF was an unfavorable predictive factor for both disease-free survival and overall survival in TNBC (N = 121, p = 0.03 and p = 0.04 for DFS and OS, respectively, Table 2, Figure 5A,B).3.5. ER\u03b136 Expression Affects Transcription of Matrix Disassembly and Immune Response Genes in BC PatientsSince tumors with high ER\u03b136 fibroblasts were correlated with higher expressions of CD163 and CD68, which are known to be markers of M2-polarized macrophages, we decided to analyze the expression of immune-related genes in CAFs ER\u03b136high and ER\u03b136low groups of BC patients. We used an nCounter PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel, (NanoString Technologies) in BC patient samples with high and low ER\u03b136 protein levels in tumor stromal fibroblasts. We found that 6 mRNA transcripts were upregulated in the ER\u03b136high group, and 41 transcripts were downregulated. The most upregulated transcript was SPP1 (logFC = 1.64, p = 0.01), and the most downregulated mRNA transcript was CXCL13 (logFC = \u22122.21, p = 0.02, Supplementary Data 2).To determine the biological significance of major up- and downregulated transcripts, Gene Ontology Biological Processes were analyzed using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool. The most upregulated biological process in patients with high levels of ER\u03b136 in tumor stroma fibroblasts was extracellular matrix disassembly (GO:0022617, q value = 0.04), and the most downregulated process was the regulation of immune response (GO:0050776, q value less than 0.001, Supplementary Data 3). All significantly affected biological processes are listed in Figure 6.4. DiscussionThe heterogeneity of CAFs is still a matter of investigation. Here, we presented for the first time that breast cancer-associated fibroblasts express estrogen receptor-\u03b1 isoform ER\u03b136, and that CAF subpopulations with a high expression of ER\u03b136 secrete a set of cytokines, which are known to have an impact on cancer progression. Furthermore, in our study, HGF produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs induced an invasive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro and was correlated with poorer TNBC patient outcomes.Cytokines produced by ER\u03b136high CAFs\u2014CXCL1, CXCL5, HGF, IL-8, GM-CSF, and VEGF\u2014are mainly pro-tumorigenic. CXCL1 expressed by stromal breast CAFs is correlated with tumor grade, disease recurrence, and decreased patient survival. It is also linked with chemoresistance and metastasis. CXCL5 was identified by Romero-Moreno and colleagues as a key factor in breast cancer cell colonization of the bone in the mouse model. IL-8 was one of the factors to promote TNBC cell colony formation and predict patient survival times. In our analysis, IL-8 was linked with poor overall survival in the TCGA dataset. VEGF is a known pro-angiogenic factor and an unfavorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. All the factors identified to be secreted by ER\u03b136high CAFs may affect tumor progression in different ways. However, in our in vitro set up, HGF was a sufficient inducer of MDA-MB-321 cell colonies branching in 3D through the AKT signaling pathway. HGF is known to be broadly expressed by CAFs; however, no study has linked its expression with specific a CAF subtype. In general, HGF-induced c-Met signaling and the associated AKT pathway are known to be tumor-promoting factors in terms of cancer cell proliferation, motility, and invasiveness, which corresponds to our findings. However, one study by Ridolfi and colleagues in 2008 showed the opposite effect of HGF using the same cell line, and it requires further study. The clinical part of our study was mainly limited by the small number of patients with TNBC; thus, we decided to analyze the influence of the ER\u03b136high CAF cytokine panel on BC patients from the TCGA database. HGF was found to confer poor DFS as well as OS in TNBC patients, supporting the results obtained in vitro. These results support other studies where HGF/c-Met signaling has been correlated with poorer patient outcomes and tested as a potential therapy target. Our findings suggest ER\u03b136high CAFs as an additional factor in HGF/c-Met signaling activation and tumor progression in TNBC cells.In the clinical analysis, we found that ER\u03b136-positive fibroblasts correlated positively with CD163 and CD68 expression in BC stroma samples. CD163 and CD68 are factors linked with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Takahashi and colleagues showed that CAFs are able to educate CD14-positive macrophages obtained from healthy donors into pro-tumoral macrophages with high expressions of CD68, CD14, CD163, CD200R, and CD206. Moreover, the presence of CD163-positive TAMs was recently associated with the poor prognosis of TNBC patients. The above studies have suggested the importance of the CAF\u2013TAM loop in tumor progression. We propose that ER\u03b136high CAFs have their role in macrophages polarization; the understanding of this interaction merits further studies. We also observed high expressions of Ki67 and CXCR4 BC samples in the ER\u03b136high CAF groups, which suggests their role in cancer cell proliferation and migration. Immune-related gene expression and GO biological process analysis revealed that genes overexpressed by the ER\u03b136high CAF group were linked with extracellular matrix disassembly. Indeed, CAFs are known to be the major ECM remodeling agents in TME. However, the most downregulated biological processes were connected with immune and inflammatory responses, as well as with the regulation of immune response. Immune suppression and immune escape are linked with cancer progression and poor patient outcomes. Moreover, research data suggest that HGF/c-Met signaling is also involved in the immune response. However, whether it acts as a suppressive or immune-positive stimulus is unknown.During CAF isolation, we found that the obtained cells stained positively for Vimentin and negatively for E-cadherin, in a uniform way. However, alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) staining was more heterogeneous. This heterogeneity in \u03b1-SMA in CAFs has been reported previously, and it has been suggested that CAFs with a high expression of \u03b1-SMA represent a pro-tumorigenic population. In our study, the heterogeneity of \u03b1-SMA staining did not have an impact on any of the obtained results. It also did not correlate with ER\u03b136 expression (data not shown). Due to the heterogeneous \u03b1-SMA staining results, we decided to use positive Vimentin staining and negative E-cadherin staining as a CAF marker.To summarize, we have shown that the heterogeneity of CAFs in breast cancer extends to ER\u03b136 isoform expression. CAFs expressing high levels of ER\u03b136 secrete HGF and induce the aggressive phenotype of TNBC cells in vitro through the activation of the c-Met/Akt pathway, which is known to be involved in cancer progression. High levels of HGF correlated with worse survival of TNBC patients, which might indicate the importance of the stromal effect on the disease course and underlines the importance of further research on the tumor microenvironment and its role in the progression of cancer.5. ConclusionsOur study shows that CAF heterogeneity is a complex phenomenon, and many factors should be taken into consideration during tumor microenvironment investigation. We propose ER\u03b136 as a player in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at , Figure S1: (A) CAF markers analysis by immunofluorescent staining.

Metastasis is one of the best-coordinated processes between tumor cells\u2019 autonomous mechanisms and their microenvironment, and it comprises of several phenotypic steps including migration and invasion. Metastasis requires tumor cell dissemination from the primary tumor to distant organs. Although metastasis occurs via both active and passive mechanisms, the initial steps in metastasis involve integrin-directed active migration of tumor cells following degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases. Dissemination is a coordinated phenomenon of cell motility that requires the protrusion, chemotaxis, invasion and contractile activities of tumor cells to achieve integrin-directed (ID) cell migration. Altered cell adhesion, increased cell migration, and invasion of tumor cells of a solid tumor are critical phenotypes during their spread to distant organs and thus are instrumental in the process of metastasis. Abnormal migration and invasion of tumor cells are key components of the metastatic phenotype in solid tumors including breast cancers (BC). These cells migrate in two distinct modes according to their cell type and their degrees of differentiation when invading the 3D environment, a rounded apolar \u2018amoeboid\u2019 movement or an elongated polar \u2018mesenchymal\u2019 movement which involves cytoskeletal organization. Anti-metastatic efficacy of several drugs in BC have been tested for their effectiveness in blocking tumor cell migration as well as invasion and potentially metastasis. Thus, understanding the mechanism of regulation of migration has the potency to refine targeted therapies for treating cancers in a metastatic setting.The interaction between metastasizing tumor cells and their ECM is known to be critical in mediating MA phenotypes including integrin-mediated migration, cytoskeletal organization, and morphological transitions. Among ECM components, integrins contribute to progression in many cancers, including breast cancers and down-regulation of surface alpha4beta1-receptor during oncogenic transformation critical for the establishment of the alpha5beta1-receptor-induced, MMP1\u2013dependent invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells. Integrins\u2019 intracellular domains connect directly or indirectly to the actin cytoskeleton, thus linking the cytoskeleton to the ECM. Integrins constitute a highly dynamic and complex dialogue between the tumor epithelium and the surrounding microenvironment. The ECM\u2013integrin axis initiates and maintains crucial cellular functions including survival and migration which are essential regulators of tumor cell phenotypes. Integrins of the beta1 family and integrin-mediated signaling events have been reported to play an important role in breast tumor growth and progression. Thus, integrins contribute to cancer progression by mediating cancer cell invasion leading to metastasis. Among integrins, fibronectin has been recognized as a crucial element in cell adhesion and migration. High fibronectin expression in breast tumor cells was associated with expression of MMPs including MMP7, a higher probability of metastasis, and poorer overall survival revealing a direct relationship between integrin-directed migration and invasion of tumor cells.Rho GTPases contribute to different steps of cancer progression, including invasion and metastasis and control signal transduction pathways linking cell surface receptors to a variety of intracellular responses including cell polarity and microtubule dynamics via the actin cytoskeleton. The signaling of the Rho family of small GTPases regulates the cytoskeleton-dependent processes during the cell migration. Cdc42 and RAC1 induce integrin-mediated cell motility and invasiveness. RAC is a small GTPase of the Rho family that mediates stimulus-induced (including integrin) actin cytoskeletal reorganization to generate lamellipodia. RAC1 by its ability to (1) maintain cellular morphology, (2) maintain polarity and (3) to modulate actin cytoskeleton reorganization during an integrin-mediated directional movement of cells has been identified as the major mediator of metastatic progression. Activated RAC1 acts as an intracellular signal transducer to regulate multiple cellular events including cytoskeleton dynamics to maintain cellular morphology, polarity, adhesion and migration. By regulating cytoskeleton rearrangements, RAC1 GTPases play a vital role in MA cellular phenotypes including adhesion, migration, and invasion. A key role for RAC1 in the regulation of cytoskeleton reorganization is to promote actin assembly required for the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. Cancer cell motility occurs through actin reorganization and control of integrin-directed cell migration via the actin cytoskeleton providing the possibility of regulating cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The \u201cmesenchymal\u201d movement (elongated movement of cancer cells) requires activation of RAC1, whereas rounded/amoeboid movement engages specific Cdc42 signaling pathways. One of the ways RAC1 transduces signals is from integrins. RAC1 is involved in integrin-mediated adhesion. Deregulated expression or activation patterns of RAC1 can result in aberrant cell signaling and numerous pathological conditions.TNBC is an aggressive disease with poor clinical outcome. Although major advances have been achieved in the screening and treatment of primary tumors, management of metastasis still remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in TNBC. To metastasize to the host organ, tumor cell first dissociates from the primary tumor, traverses tumor basement membrane, and stroma, intravasate, survive in the circulation amongst the host of immune cells and finally, extravasate from the microvasculature to \u201chome\u201d in the secondary organ as it forms micro-metastasis. The intermittent steps involving integrin-directed migration and invasion have been described as rate-limiting events in metastasis in particular. Metastatic dissemination of the disease is the leading cause of TNBC associated mortality and currently, one-third of patients develops recurrence within three years of adjuvant therapy. In a highly aggressive and heterogeneous form of TNBC, tumor cells acquire key phenotypic characteristics typical for metastasis including integrin-directed aberrant migration and invasion through ECM following beta1 and beta4 integrin engagement. Genetic alterations which cause deregulation of different signaling pathways are responsible for the acquisitions of these integrin-directed metastasis-associated (ID-MA) phenotypes which in turn determine the fate of the tumor cells. Our study demonstrated that an upregulation of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway (WP) is one of the salient genetic features of TNBC and established that WP signaling in TNBC is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. We have also identified that the functional upregulation of secreted-MMP7, a transcriptional target of WP in TNBC is associated with the functional loss/absence of PTEN gene, the most common first event associated with basal-like subtype. Thus, TNBC tumor cells can acquire ID-MA phenotypes which are imparted by WP alterations. The WP is a ligand-driven signaling pathway activation of which leads to a context-dependent transcription of beta-catenin target genes (http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/pathways/targets.html) that directly governs phenotypes including migration, polarity, and matrix remodeling in several diseases including cancers. Recently, we have identified the relevance of WP pathway in the biology of metastasizing TNBC tumor cells by undertaking a comprehensive study in which the involvement of WP was tested in the context of MA phenotypes and demonstrated that WP signals ID-MA tumor cell phenotypes in TNBC. Since RAC1 activation instrumentally regulates the integrin-directed directional movement of tumor cells and WP activation in TNBC is functionally associated with ID-MA tumor cell phenotypes including migration and invasion, we hypothesized that WP regulates ID-MA tumor cell phenotypes of TNBC in RAC1-GTP-ase dependent manner.Here we present evidence for the first time to demonstrate that the MA upregulation of WP signals for fibronectin-directed migration and invasion via activation of RAC1-GTPase and thus RAC1 activation acts as a downstream signal of WP activation in TNBC in the regulation of fibronectin-directed MA tumor cell phenotypes. The identification of the functional relationship between RAC1 signaling and the activation of WP in control of integrin-directed MA tumor cell phenotypes in TNBC mechanistically explain how the activation of WP in this subtype of BC is associated with the high metastatic incidences and a dismal outcome. Our study is the first report presenting that RAC1-activation via beta-catenin-VAV2/TIAM1 cascade acts as a downstream signaling event of WP activation in TNBC in the regulation of fibronectin-directed MA tumor cell phenotypes.RESULTSAlterations of RAC1 gene in BC and different subtypesOncoprints showed alterations (amplification, gain, shallow deletion, mRNA upregulation and mRNA downregulation) of RAC1 gene in multiple subtypes of BC from two data sets, (1) TCGA, Nature, 2012 (cBioPortal) and (2) TCGA, Cell 2015; brca/tcga/pub2015 (cBioPortal) (Figure 1A-1C). Figure 1A shows that the percentages of RAC1 gene alterations in a data set of TCGA, Nature 2012. The overall frequency of RAC1 gene alterations for the entire sample set (TCGA, Nature, 2012) was 29%. Breaking down by molecular subtypes of BC, RAC1 gene alterations are observed in 20% in PAM50 Luminal A, 35% in PAM50 Luminal B, 37% in PAM50 HER2 enriched and 40% in PAM50 Basal-like. In the data set of TCGA, Cell 2015, RAC1 gene was altered more frequently in ER-ve cases (57%) as compared to ER+ve samples (38%). For the samples set of TCGA, Cell 2015, RAC1 gene was altered in 42% total while it was altered 37% in PAM50 Luminal A, 57% in PAM50 Luminal B, 55% in PAM50 HER2 enriched and 60% in PAM50 basal-like. These changes indicate that there is a consistent trend of higher levels of alterations in RAC1 gene in both ER-ve samples and PAM50 basal-like type of BC as compared to ER+ve samples and total samples of breast invasive carcinoma tumors respectively. Amplification and gain of RAC1 gene occurred more than 50% of the time in all four categories of tumors tested (PAM50 Luminal A, PAM50 Luminal B, PAM50 HER2 and PAM50 Basal) in TCGA, Nature 2012 (cBioPortal) samples. The oncoprints showed that the major alterations of RAC1 gene were constituted by the amplification/gain of the gene as compared to other changes (Figure 1). Interestingly, when the specific alterations of RAC1 gene in the PAM50 Basal tumors were considered, we observed that the gain and amplification of the RAC1 gene comprised 20% of the total alterations. The higher expressions of RAC1 mRNA were associated with gain and amplification of RAC1 gene (Supplementary Figure S1).Alterations of RAC1 gene in breast cancers and breast cancer subtypesA.

Fibronectin stimulation has been shown to activate RAC1 which also signals the cytoskeleton-dependent processes taking place during the cell migration in tumor cells.We used RAC1 Inhibitor, NSC23766 to test the involvement of RAC1 in fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and BT20 TNBC cells. In MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and BT20 TNBC cells, fibronectin stimulation caused an activation of RAC1 as demonstrated by the increased levels of RAC1-GTP. Although the degree of inhibition of RAC1 activation varied in between cell lines, inhibition of RAC1 by NSC23766 was observed in all cell lines tested (Figure 2A). Having confirmed the effect of the RAC1 inhibitor on the activation of RAC1 in cells, we tested the effect of the RAC1 inhibitor on fibronectin-induced migration in different TNBC cell lines. NSC23766 blocked fibronectin-induced transwell migration in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, Hs578t, SUM149 and BT20 TNBC Cells (Figure 2B). Migration of cells was found to be highest in Hs578t and MDA-MB231 cells. However, the inhibitory effect of NSC23766 was consistent with all cell lines as compared to their controls.Effect of RAC1 Inhibitors, NSC23766 and W56 on fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation, fibronectin-induced migration, LWnt3ACM stimulated fibronectin-induced migration, and Wnt3A Recombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in TNBC CellsA. NSC23766 inhibited fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, and BT20 cells. TNBC cells were stimulated on fibronectin coated plates. RAC1 pull down was carried out on stimulated cells in the presence and absence of NSC23766. Total RAC1 were used as loading controls.

Bar diagram (*P< 0.05) shows changes in the width of scratch (X10).RAC1 inhibitors, NSC23766 and W56 blocked both LWnt3ACM stimulated and Wnt3A Recombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in TNBC cellsTo verify that the effect of RAC1 inhibitor on the fibronectin-directed migration is WP specific, we used specific WP stimulation using both LWnt3ACM as well as Wnt3A Recombinant and tested the effect of two RAC1 inhibitors, NSC23766 and W56 on the LWnt3ACM stimulated and Wnt3A Recombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in BT20, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 TNBC Cells. Data showed that RAC1 inhibitors, NSC23766 and W56, blocked LWnt3ACM stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in BT20 TNBC cells (Figure 2C). Similarly, RAC1 Inhibitor, NSC23766 blocked Wnt3ARecombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 TNBC cells (Figure 2D).WP modulators, WntC59, and XAV939 blocked fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation, and Wnt3A Recombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in TNBC cellsWP signals MA tumor cell phenotypes in TNBC. Earlier, we demonstrated that WP modulators, WntC59, and XAV939 blocked fibronectin-induced migration of TNBC cells. To examine the role of WP in the activation of RAC1 in mediating fibronectin-induced migration in TNBC, we first tested fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation following WP modulators, WntC59, and XAV939. WntC59 and XAV939 blocked fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation in BT20, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 TNBC cells (Figure 3A). Both inhibitors of WP signals blocked fibronectin-mediated RAC1 activation in different TNBC cells. We tested the specificity of the effect of WP inhibition by studying the effect of WntC59 and XAV939 on Wnt3A Recombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration of TNBC cells to show that WntC59 and XAV939 blocked Wnt3ARecombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 TNBC cells (Figure 3B).Effect of WP modulators, WntC59 and XAV939 on fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation and Wnt3A Recombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in TNBC CellsA.

We used WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide to downregulate cellular levels of beta-catenin in TNBC cell lines. Our in vitro phenotypic experiments focused on beta-catenin as it can be pharmacologically targeted (by sulindac sulfide) as well as tested in clinical trials. We used sulindac sulfide as a tool to test the role of RAC1 in mediating the effect of WP in ID-MA in TNBC. WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide decreased total beta-catenin as well as a transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin in SUM149, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 4A), a result we reported previously. Sulindac sulfide blocked fibronectin-induced migration in transwell and scratch assay in SUM149, Hs578t, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 4B-4C) and abrogated fibronectin-induced matrigel invasion in SUM149 and MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 4D). The confocal microscopy of the stained migrated cells showed the disorganized morphology of cells following sulindac sulfide treatment (lower panel of Figure 4C).Effect of WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide on total beta-catenin and active beta-catenin, fibronectin-induced migration by scratch assay, fibronectin-induced transwell migration, matrigel invasion and Wnt3ARecombinant stimulated fibronectin-induced migration in TNBC cellsA. Sulindac sulfide decreased total beta-catenin as well as transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin in SUM149, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells. Cells were treated with sulindac sulfide and levels of total and active beta-catenin was determined by Western blots. Actin was used as loading controls.

Figure 4E showed that sulindac sulfide abrogated fibronectin-induced Wnt3ARecombinant stimulated migration in TNBC cells.Actin cytoskeleton and podia-parameters of cells were altered following sulindac sulfide which abrogated fibronectin-induced activation of RAC1 in TNBC cellsHaving proved the WP specificity in the fibronectin-mediated migration in TNBC cells, we tested actin cytoskeleton structure and podia-parameters of cells following sulindac sulfide to show that sulindac sulfide altered actin cytoskeleton organization (Figure 5A-5B) and podia-parameters of MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 5C-5D). Cells which failed to move on fibronectin following treatment with sulindac sulfide showed a significant reduction in the number of lamellipodia although filipodia formations were increased. We observed a similar effect of sulindac sulfide in different TNBC cells previously. Finally, we tested whether sulindac sulfide treatment under similar condition had any effect on the activation of RAC1 following integrin engagement. Sulindac sulfide abrogated fibronectin-induced activation of RAC1 in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, BT20, Hs578t and SUM149 cells (Figure 5E). Although fibronectin stimulation activated RAC1 to a different degree in different TNBC cells, treatment with sulindac sulfide blocked the RAC1 activation in all TNBC cells.Effect of sulindac sulfide on fibronectin-induced cytoskeleton structure of filamentous actin, podia-parameters and activation of RAC1 and Cdc42 in TNBC cellsA-B.

Sulindac sulfide abrogated fibronectin induced activation of RAC1 as determined from RAC1-GTP pull-down assay in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, BT20, Hs578t and SUM149 cells.SiRNA mediated downregulation of beta-catenin protein blocked fibronectin-induced migration and fibronectin-induced matrigel invasion in TNBC cellsIt has been established that sulindac sulfide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or Cox inhibitor, affecting a wide array of a signaling pathway in addition to WP. Thus, we also used beta-catenin siRNA to verify the specificity of the effect. Transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA (Figure 6A) at different time points starting from 24 hours to 96 hours caused downregulation of beta-catenin protein in HCC1937, MDA-MB231, and BT20 cells. Two different time points were included for the control siRNA. The effect of siRNA was observed from 24 hours and continued till 96 hours in all cell lines. SiRNA mediated downregulation of beta-catenin protein blocked fibronectin-induced migration in MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 6B) as shown in the upper panel pictures of the stained migrated cells (DAPI, F-actin, and merge) and lower panel bar-diagrams made from the number of migrated cells. SiRNA mediated downregulation of beta-catenin protein blocked fibronectin-induced matrigel invasion in MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 6C).Effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of beta-catenin on fibronectin-directed migration, matrigel-invasion, transcriptionally active beta-catenin and fibronectin-induced activation of RAC1 in TNBC cellsA. BT20, MDA-MB231 and HCC1937 cells were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA for 96 hours. Total levels of beta-catenin were determined by Western blots and compared between siRNA (24, 48, 72 and 96 hours) and control (24, and 96 hours) cells at similar time points. Actin was used as loading controls. Bar diagram shows changes in the relative density (Arbitrary Units). B. MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours and then allowed to migrate on fibronectin in a transwell assay.

Bar diagram (*P< 0.05) shows a number of cells migrated through transwell membrane (X10). C. MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours and then allowed to invade across matrigel on fibronectin. Bar diagram (*P< 0.05) shows a number of cells invaded across matrigel (X10). D. Active beta-catenin was determined from lysates of MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells which were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours. Beta-catenin levels were used as the reference for the transient transfection of siRNA. Actin was used as loading control. Bar diagram shows changes in the relative density (Arbitrary Units). E. Active RAC1 (GTP-RAC1) and active beta-catenin were determined from lysates of MDA-MB468, which were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours.

Bar diagram shows changes in the relative density (Arbitrary Units).SiRNA mediated downregulation of beta-catenin protein decreased transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin and blocked fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation in TNBC cellsTo test the biochemical effect of beta-catenin siRNA on the WP, we tested the effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of beta-catenin protein on the transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin in cells. As expected, siRNA mediated downregulation of total beta-catenin protein decreased transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin in MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 6D) as previously reported by us in other TNBC cell lines. Having proved the effect of beta-catenin siRNA on the WP signals, we set the stage to test the effect of downregulation of WP on the RAC1 activation in TNBC cells. SiRNA mediated downregulation of beta-catenin protein blocked fibronectin-induced RAC1 activation in MDA-MB468 and BT20 cells (Figure 6E).Fibronectin-induced activation of Cdc42 was abrogated by the RAC1 inhibitor, WP modulators, sulindac sulfide and transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA in TNBC cellsFigure 7A shows that the fibronectin-induced activation of Cdc42 was blocked following RAC1 inhibitor, WntC59, XAV939 as well as transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA in BT20 cells. Similarly, fibronectin-induced activation of Cdc42 was abrogated by sulindac sulfide in MDA-MB468, Hs578t, SUM149 and BT20 cells (Figure 7B).Effect of RAC1 inhibitor, WP modulators, sulindac sulfide and beta-catenin siRNA on fibronectin-mediated activation of Cdc42 in TNBC cellsA.

NSC23766, a small molecule RAC1 inhibitor has been shown to inhibit RAC1 specifically without any activity against RhoGTPases. Figure 8A showed that NSC23766 blocked fibronectin-induced LWnt3A conditioned media stimulated migration of brain metastasis-specific MDA-MB231BR TNBC cells. We performed an experiment demonstrating the activation of canonical WP signals following the exposure of cells to LWnt3ACM by testing the nuclear transportation of beta-catenin by nuclear fractionation. WB from the nuclear fraction showed that nuclear beta-catenin was increased in MDA-MB231BR cells 24 hours after LWnt3ACM stimulation. Data shows that Wnt signaling is stimulated in cells with LWnt3ACM (+) at 24 hours as evident from the increased levels of beta-catenin accumulation compared to the non-stimulated(-)-condition (Figure 8A, Inset). Figure 8B represents a proposed diagrammatic role of RAC1 activation in the integrin-mediated directional movement of TNBC cells under WP activation.Effect of RAC1 inhibitors, NSC 23766 and W56 on LWnt3A-stimulated fibronectin-mediated migration of brain metastasis-specific TNBC cellsA. EGFP-tagged brain metastasis-specific TNBC cells, MDA-MB231BR were allowed to migrate on fibronectin for 24 hours under LWnt3A stimulation in the presence or absence of RAC1 inhibitors. Zero hour control for each scratch was presented as the internal control. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in MDA-MB231BR cells under LWnt3A stimulation (Inset). Wnt signaling is stimulated in TNBC cells with LWnt3ACM (+) at 24 hours, and is assessed based on the level of beta-catenin accumulation compared to the non-stimulated(-)-condition. Histones were used as a nuclear marker. Beta-actin expression was used as total protein loading control. B. Schematic representation of the mode of involvement of WP via activation of RAC1 in the integrin-mediating directional movement of tumor cells through actin cytoskeletal organization.Alterations of TIAM1 and VAV2 genes, exchange factors responsible for RAC1 activity in TNBCTo define the mechanism of activation of RAC1 in TNBC, we studied the alterations of TIAM1 and VAV2 genes in TCGA data set. Oncoprints showed alterations (amplification, deep deletion, mRNA upregulation truncating mutation and missense mutation) of TIAM1 and VAV2 genes in invasive breast carcinomas and TNBC data sets, (Figure 9A). Figure 9A shows that TIAM1 and VAV2 genes were altered in 6% of breast invasive carcinomas (upper panel). TIAM1 and VAV2 genes were altered in 10% and 7% respectively in TNBC subtype (lower panel).Mechanism of RAC1 activation in TNBC following WP stimulationA. Alterations of TIAM1 and VAV2 genes (exchange factors for RAC1 activation) in breast invasive carcinoma and TNBC subtype:Oncoprints (cBioPortal) showing alterations in TIAM1 and VAV2 genes in Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, Cell 2015; brca/tcga/pub2015) (upper panel) and TNBC subtype (lower panel). The patient selected were, (1) Breast Invasive Carcinoma; (817 patients/817 samples) and (2) Breast Invasive Carcinoma, TNBC (82 patients/82 samples). B.

MDA-MB231BR (i) and BT20 (ii) TNBC cellswere stimulated with LWnt3A CM in the presence and absence of two doses of sulindac sulfide. The mRNA expression of beta-catenin target genes, CCND1 and cMYC were quantified by qRT-PCR. D. Quantification of TIAM1 and VAV2 mRNA by qRT-PCR following sulindac sulfide treatment (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) in BT20 cells under the stimulation of WP by LWnt3A condition media (LWnt3A CM). BT20 (i) TNBC cellswere stimulated with LWnt3A CM in the presence and absence of two doses of sulindac sulfide. The mRNA expression of genes for RAC1 exchange factors, TIAM1 and VAV2 were quantified by qRT-PCR. Melting curves were included in each case. Amplified genomic materials were analyzed for consistency via melting analysis. Each peak represents individual gene products according to base pair size. VAV2 peaks overlap with GAPDH as they are nearly identical in amplicon size. The relative mRNA expression of TIAM1 and VAV2 genes to GAPDH (used as the reference) were determined using LightCycler96 software from Roche. Bars indicate mean \u00b1 SE (In triplicates). *P> 0.05. The exchange-factor mediated RAC1 activation in TNBC is schematically represented (ii).Nuclear localization of beta-catenin in TNBC cells following LWnt3A CM stimulationWe tested the nuclear localization of beta-catenin in TNBC cells following LWnt3A CM stimulation. The merged images of Figure 9B showed that following LWnt3A CM stimulation, nuclear localization of beta-catenin was increased in the cells.Transcriptional upregulation of beta-catenin target genes, CCND1 and cMYC following LWnt3A CM stimulationQuantification of beta-catenin target genes, CCND1 and cMYC in MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells were carried out to test the activation status of WP. Figure 9C (i and ii) showed that both mRNAs for both target genes were significantly increased following LWnt3A CM stimulation, and this increase was blocked by the sulindac sulfide treatment. Figure 9C shows that the increase in the nuclear beta-catenin (Figure 9B) is capable of increasing the expression of mRNA (by qRT-PCR) levels for \u201ctranscriptional target genes of beta-catenin\u201d like cyclin D1 and cMYC in MDA-MB231BR as well as in BT20 TNBC cells, and sulindac sulfide can block this increase. Both Figure 9B and 9C established the fact that in our model system, WP stimulation is functional.Mechanism of RAC1 activation via exchange factors, TIAM1 and VAV2 in TNBCOnce the status of WP stimulation/function was confirmed in our TNBC model system, we tried to seek the mechanism of RAC1 activation. Figure 9Di showed that mRNAs of RAC1 exchange factors TIAM1 and VAV2 were significantly increased following the LWnt3ACM stimulation in BT20 cells. The increase was blocked following 24 hours of the treatment with sulindac sulfide.Kaplan-Meier survival for RFS split on the median expression of Affymetrix probe 208640_at RAC1 in IHC determined ER-ve samples in the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) breast cancer cohortHaving demonstrated the mechanistic role of RAC1 activation in WP mediated ID-MA phenotypes in TNBC, we sought to define the relationship between RAC1 and outcome in ER-ve breast cancers. In the Hungarian Academy of Science breast cancer cohort, we observed that Kaplan-Meier survival for RFS split on the median expression of Affymetrix probe 208640_at RAC1 in IHC determined ER-ve samples. The mRNA expression of RAC1 in the Hungarian Academy of Science breast cancer cohort (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020197) ER-ve breast cancer cohort suggests that high expression denotes poor outcome for RFS HR=1.48 [CI:1.15-1.9] p=0.0019 when split on the median. High expression of RAC1 denoted poor outcome (Figure 10).Kaplan-Meier survival for RFS split on the median expression of Affymetrix probe 208640_at RAC1 in IHC determined ER-ve samples in the HAS breast cancer cohortHigh expression of RAC1 denotes poor outcome.DISCUSSIONOur study was built on two of our previous reports which established an association between WP and TNBC in the context of metastasis in line with others. Since TNBC is an aggressive disease, we then hypothesized that the upregulation of WP in this subtype has a functional relationship with ID-MA phenotypes which led to our third report demonstrating that WP signals ID-MA tumor cell phenotypes. As migration occurs following an alteration of the adhesive property of cells and migration is required for tumor cell invasion and eventually metastasis, we tested the involvement of RAC1 downstream of WP pathway activation in the integrin-directed migration of TNBC cells. To determine the mechanism of WP action in the biology of ID-MA tumor cell phenotypes in this study, we used attenuators of WP signals including WntC59 and XAV939, beta-catenin siRNA, sulindac sulfide as well as stimulators of WP signals including Wnt3A recombinant protein and LWnt3ACM. Our study included TNBC cell lines representing all major types of genetic alterations as reported earlier. Our validation strategy included alteration of beta-catenin because beta-catenin is the functional readout of WP. Hence, we pharmacologically (by sulindac sulfide) and genetically (siRNA) attenuated beta-catenin and studied the effect of this maneuver on ID-MA vis-\u00e0-vis activation of RAC1 and Cdc42. Two RAC1 inhibitors were used as internal controls to test the effect of RAC1 signals on the ID-MA phenotypes in TNBC. The specificity of the effect of WP attenuators was tested using them following the WP stimulators in the context of ID-MA phenotypes. The specificity of RAC1 activation in WP mediated ID-MA phenotypes in the context of metastasis were tested using brain metastasis-specific MDA-MB231BR TNBC cells.The initial evidence for Rho GTPases in breast tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo came from studies expressing dominant negative forms of RhoA, RAC1 and Cdc42. It should be understood that the upregulation of RAC1 and Cdc42 signals occurs in other subtypes of BC. In fact, an increased migratory capacity of T47D ER+ve cells overexpressing Cdc42 and RAC has shown a disorganized morphology on collagen gels. We observed a similar morphological disorganization in TNBC cells those migrated poorly on fibronectin following sulindac sulfide (lower panel of Figure 4C) which resulted in abrogation of fibronectin-stimulated activation of RAC1 and Cdc42. A similar perturbation of fibronectin-stimulated activation of RAC1 and Cdc42 following the blockade of WP after WntC59, XAV939 treatment and transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA was demonstrated in TNBC cells (Figure 3A, Figure 6E, Figure 7A) which were comparable to the inhibition of fibronectin-stimulated activation of RAC1 following RAC1 inhibitor (Figure 2A). RAC1 and Cdc42 regulate signal transduction pathways that mediate distinct cytoskeletal rearrangements required for the production of actin-rich protrusions called lamellipodia and filopodia and then subsequent cell migration. Cell spreading of MTLn3 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells was selectively abrogated by dominant negative N17RAC1. We have observed that perturbation of WP following sulindac sulfide treatment disorganized the cytoarchitecture of filamentous actin in TNBC cells (Figure 5A-5B). Our observation was in line with the loss of lamellipodia formation on fibronectin in the same TNBC cells following sulindac sulfide (Figure 5C-5D). We demonstrated that RAC1 inhibitors abrogated LWnt3ACM stimulated fibronectin-mediated migration of metastasis-specific TNBC cell lines (Figure 8A). Our study demonstrated for the first time that the RAC1 activation and fibronectin-mediated MA phenotypes are functions of WP in TNBC.Increased protein levels of RAC and Cdc42 have been reported in BC. Similarly the alterations of RAC1 gene are the highest in PAM50 Basal tumors (TCGA Nature2012) (40%), ER-ve breast tumors (Cell 2015) (57%) as well as PAM50 Basal tumors (TCGA Cell 2015) (60%), as compared to other BC subtypes (Figure 1). In the PAM50 Basal tumors, the combined percentage of the gain and amplification of RAC1 gene was 20%, and the higher expressions of RAC1 mRNA were associated with gain and amplification of RAC1 gene (Supplementary Figure S1). In the metastatic setting, an increased RAC1 GTP-ase protein has been observed in 100% of lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemical staining of RAC1 showed weak RAC1 expression in benign breast disease but high expression levels in DCIS, primary breast cancer, and lymph node metastases. Breast tumor cells from patients with recurrent disease had RAC1 expression localized at the plasma membrane, suggesting activation of RAC1, in patients with aggressive BC. Because GTP-bound RAC1 is translocated to the cell membrane, results suggest that constitutive activation of RAC1 signaling may be characteristically present in more aggressive forms of BC. A direct involvement of the alpha5beta1 integrin (a component of fibronectin) in the regulation of actin-mediated migration and invasion via RAC1 has been reported. A cytosolic protein, Nischarin, binding the alpha5beta1 integrin (a component of fibronectin) plays an important role in migration by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Nischarin inhibits RAC induced migration and invasion of BC cells by affecting signaling cascades involving PAK, an immediate downstream of RAC1. We have observed that fibronectin stimulation causes activation of RAC1 and Cdc42 in five different TNBC cells (Figure 5E), and this activation was abrogated by an RAC1 inhibitor (Figure 2A).We studied the signal(s) that initiated RAC1 activation in BC. Wild-type RAC GTP-ases cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states and the conversions are mediated by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors, GEFs and GTPase Activating Proteins, GAPs (please see the cartoon, Figure Dii). In BC, RAC1 signaling has been demonstrated to involve enhanced upstream inputs of GEFs and reduced RAC inactivation by GAPs. The role of Rho GTPases in BC has also been indicated from the report that progression of breast tumors is accompanied by a decrease in expression of the Rho guanine exchange factor TIAM1 and is inversely associated with several established breast tumor markers. RAC activator, TIAM1 is a WP-responsive gene. The fact that TIAM1 is one of the WP Target Genes has been reported in the \u201cThe Wnt Homepage\u201d of 1997 - 2016 Roel Nusse (http://web.stanford.edu/group/nusselab/cgi-bin/lab/main; The Nusse Lab: Sandford University CA; Last updated: January 2016). Recently the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate-dependent RAC Exchanger 1\u00b7Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (P-Rex1\u00b7RAC1) complex revealed the basis of RAC1 activation in BC cells. Engelman's group have identified P-Rex as a PIP3-dependent guanine exchange factor for RAC1 responsible for the activation of RAC1 in HER2 amplified and/or PIK3CA mutant BC cells. We recently demonstrated that integrin-directed migration of BC cells can be abrogated by the inhibition of RAC1 activation following BEZ235.Since activation of PI3K pathway leads to blockade of cytosolic degradation of beta-catenin via GSK3beta (Figure 8B), it is plausible that an upregulated PI3K pathway (PTEN loss in the case of TNBC) may signal synergistically with WP in TNBC causing the activation of RAC1.RAC1 was overexpressed or hyperactive in breast cancer tissues. The active variant RAC1b is found to be expressed in human breast tumors. How is RAC1 activated in breast cancers in the context of ID-MA phenotypes? Emerging evidence supports a role for RAC-GEFs in the development and progression of breast cancer. Also, there has been a correlation reported between TIAM1 expression and high tumor grade in human breast carcinomas. MDA-MB231 expresses high levels of TIAM1 and is also know for its highly migratory and metastatic property. The proto-oncogene VAV family, a RAC/Rho-GEF, is also known to be overexpressed in 81% of human breast tumors. Thus, it is possible that beta1 integrin\u2013mediated migratory/invasive phenotype involving F-actin is functionally associated to RAC1 via GEF in BC. VAV2 has been reported as an activator of both RAC1 and Cdc42. Dhiraj Kumar et al., reviewed that Wnt stimulated RAC1-GEF (VAV2) via Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation that further trigger RAC1 that regulate Nox1 activity and thus involved in Wnt-induced ROS production. Hence we studied both TIAM1 and VAV2 mRNAs following Wnt pathway stimulation. MDA-MB231 cells developed spindle-shaped morphology mediated by cortical F-actin and occasional stress fibers during their movements in 3D collagen matrices very similar to fibroblasts utilizing beta1 integrin\u2013mediated binding to collagen fibers for elongation and translocation which is further coupled to the cleavage and remodeling of ECM components using MMPs and other proteases. Interestingly, MMP7 and MMP9 are transcriptional targets of WP. How is RAC1 activation via GEF associated with cytosolic oncogenic signals including WP? PREX2, VAV2 and TIAM1 are widely distributed GEF that activates the GTPase RAC1, is frequently mutated GEF in cancers. A recent study has identified that PTEN loss is dependent on p110beta via a p110beta-RAC1/2-positive-feedback loop in PTEN loss driven myeloid neoplasia. In BC cell lines PTEN suppressed migration and invasion by blocking PREX2 activity, and PTEN inhibited the GEF activity of PREX2 toward RAC1. High basal Wnt activity in some mammary cancer cell lines has been reported to be associated with certain genes including the absence of PTEN. Interestingly we have previously reported that a differential activation of WP increases MMP7 in a PTEN dependent manner in TNBC. In our study, PTEN-null TNBC cell lines MDA-MB468, and SUM149 showed inhibition of fibronectin-induced RAC1 activity following WntC59, XAV939, sulindac sulfide and beta-catenin siRNA (Figure 3A, Figure 5E, Figure 6E). It can be speculated that the characteristic absence of PTEN protein in TNBC due to the loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN, the most common first event associated with basal-like subtype, may be functionally connected to the activation of RAC1. However, it needs an in-depth study for a reasonable conclusion which is beyond the scope of this study. In this study, we provide evidence for the engagement of RAC1 in WP-mediated signal for ID-MA phenotypes. However, the mechanism of RAC1 activation in TNBC cells upon WP activation remains to be studied. In this context, theWP component, Disheveled (Figure 8B) has been proposed as one of the candidates as an upstream regulator of RAC1 activity as the overexpression of Dishevelled-2, but not Dishevelled-1 upregulated RAC1 in a different context. TNBC patients\u2019 (cBioPortal) tumor expressed alterations of TIAM1 and VAV2 genes (Figure 9A). We tested the nuclear localization of beta-catenin by confocal microscopy in MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 9B). In order to test the effect of sulindac sulfide on the WP, TNBC cells were first stimulated by LWnt3A condition media and mRNA for two of the WP downstream target genes of beta-catenin, cyclinD1 and cMYC were quantified by qRT-PCR in MDA-MB231BR cells and BT20 in the presence and absence of sulindac sulfide. Having confirmed the functional state of WP in TNBC cells (Figure 9B-9C), we determined that the activation of RAC1 is mediated via the increase in the mRNA levels of its bona fide exchange factors, TIAM1 and VAV2. This data was further strengthened by the treatment with sulindac sulfide (Figure 9Di) as represented schematically in Figure 9Dii. We set out to prove that LWnt3A CM stimulation in TNBC cells cause a significant increase in TIAM1, and VAV2 mRNAs (Figure 9D). This data is in agreement with Valls et al., who reported that \u201cupon Wnt stimulation, RAC1 activation requires RAC1 and VAV2 binding to p120-catenin\u201d. In line with the above fact, our data that VAV2 mRNA (as well as TIAM1 mRNA) is increased following WP stimulation (Figure 9D) explains the higher rate of migration as a result of RAC1-GPTase activation (pull down) and alteration of the actin cytoskeleton in TNBC cells.As the routine treatment of BC is becoming more and more guided by the molecular markers present in the subtype-specific cancers, it has become imperative to identify the contribution of major pathways in TNBC in the conspicuous absence of classical targets of ER and HER2. Considering the characteristic aggressive nature of TNBC disease, such a premise becomes more compelling. The absence of hormone and growth factor receptors leaves limited opportunity for targeted therapies in this subtype of breast cancer especially in the context of the metastatic setting. In early stage recurrence, the significant pathway associated genes upregulated were MMPs and genes associated with cancer cell adhesion/motility including CDC42, RAC1 while a significant upregulation of WP genes including Wnt4 and Wnt16 was noted during stage IIIc recurrence. Here we report the WP signals in ID-MA phenotypes through activation of RAC1-GTP-ase in TNBC. We present evidence for the first time to prove that RAC1 GTP-ase signals WP-stimulated ID-MA tumor cell phenotypes, migration, and invasion in TNBC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to provide mechanistic evidence proving the role of RAC1 and Cdc42 in WP-mediated ID-MA phenotypes in TNBC. The alterations (gain/amplification) of RAC1 gene in ER-ve BC in the cBioPortal and poor outcome (RFS) data for ER-ve breast cancer cohort suggests the clinical significance of our finding in two independent data sets (Figure 9). Our data demonstrate a critical role for WP in TNBC progression and identified patients that may benefit from WP-RAC1-targeted therapies. We report for the first time that RAC1-activation via beta-catenin-TIAM1/VAV2 cascade acts as a downstream signaling event of WP activation in TNBC in the regulation of fibronectin-directed MA tumor cell phenotypes. Together, these results indicate that activation of a WP-RAC1 module contributes tumorigenic progression and identify a context-dependent role of GTP-ase in TNBC in the metastatic setting.MATERIALS AND METHODSData analyses using cbioportalWe studied alterations (amplification, deep deletion, missense mutation, mRNA upregulation, mRNA downregulation, protein upregulation and protein downregulation) in RAC1, TIAM1 and VAV2 genes in Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, 2012) case set and in Invasive Ductal Cancers (brca/tcga/pub2015) case set using c-BioPortal. The genomic studies selected were (1) missense mutations, (2) amplifications (3) deep deletion (4) putative copy-number alteration from GISTIC and (5) mRNA expression Z-scores (microarray) with Z-score thresholds \u00b1 2.0. In Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, 2012) case set, we have selected (1) all tumor samples (825 patients/825 samples) and (2) PAM50 Basal subtype (81 patients/81 samples). In the Invasive Ductal Cancer (brca/tcga/pub2015) case set, we have selected ER+ve breast tumors (594 cases/patients) and compared the data with ER-ve breast tumors (174 cases/patients). In Invasive Ductal Cancer (brca/tcga/pub2015) case set also, we have selected (1) all tumor samples (1105 cases/patients), (2) Invasive Ductal Cancer, Luminal A (201 cases/patients), (3) Invasive Ductal Cancer, PAM50 Luminal B (122 cases/patients) (4) Invasive Ductal Cancer, PAM50 Her2-enriched (51 cases/patients) and (5) Invasive Ductal Cancer, PAM50 Basal-like (107 cases/patients). Advanced cancer genomic data visualization is obtained with the help of \u201cThe Onco Query Language (OQL)\u201d. OncoPrints represents compact means of visualizing distinctive genomic alterations, including somatic mutations, copy number variations (CNV), and mRNA expression changes occurring across a set of cases. We used the Onco Query Language (OQL) to select and define genetic alterations for all the OncoPrint outputs on the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. Oncoprints (different levels of zoom) have been generated using cBioPortal. OncoPrints are used for visualizing gene set as well as pathway alterations across a set of cases, and for visually identifying trends, such as trends in mutual exclusivity or co-occurrence between gene pairs within a gene set. Tumor types (tumor data sets) were chosen in accordance with the publication guidelines (as updated on January 17th, 2014) of TCGA (tcga@mail.nih.gov). cBioPortal data is subjected to scheduled updates. We acknowledge the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics site (http://cbioportal.org) which provides a web resource for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing multidimensional cancer genomics data.Prognostic value of RAC1 in ER-ve samplesThe kmplot.com website was used to determine if RAC1 was prognostic of ER-ve samples in the Hungarian Academy of Science breast cancer cohort (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20020197). The Affymetrix probe 208640_at for RAC1 was selected as the optimal JetSet probe where recurrence-free survival (RFS) represented the maximum number of samples. The user interface was used to select IHC determined ER-ve samples (n=671) where the Kaplan-Meier figure and log-rank analysis split on the median were automatically generated by kmplot.com. The user interface and meta-data associated with the combined independent cohorts did not allow for selection of a triple negative cohort with enough samples for survival analysis.Cell lines, reagents, drugs, RAC1 inhibitors and antibodies: cell lines, reagents drugs and antibodiesTNBC cell lines (HCC1937, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, BT20, Hs578t, and SUM149) were cultured according to a standard protocol as stated previously. Our study included TNBC cell lines representing all major types of genetic alterations as described in detail in the discussion section. We used PTEN-null (MDA-MB468), CDKN2A-alterations (BT20, MDA-MB231), RAS/RAF mutated (MDA-MB231), RB1-alteration (MDA-MB468), BRCA1-competent (MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468), BRCA1-incompetent (HCC1937, SUM149), EGFR-overexpressed (MDA-MB468), p53-mutated (BT20, HCC1937, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468) and PIK3CA-mutated (BT20) as well as histology like IDC (SUM149) and adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468) in our study. TNBC cell line BT20 which expresses the WNT3 and the WNT7B oncogenes were used. To test a direct involvement of WP in metastasis in TNBC, we used EGFP-tagged brain metastasis-specific cell line, MDA-MB231BR (a kind gift from Dr. P. S. Steeg; Women's Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All BC cell lines except SUM149 cell line were obtained from ATCC. The SUM149 cell line was obtained from Asterand (Partners in human tissue research). Antibodies including tubulin (BD Biosciences, CA), actin, active beta-catenin and beta-catenin (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) were used for the study. Sulindac sulfide was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. RAC1 inhibitors, NSC 23766 and W56 were procured from Tocris Bioscience (R&D system). NSC23766 is a selective inhibitor of RAC1-GEF interaction. NSC23766 prevents RAC1 activation by RAC-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (e.g. TIAM1). This compound was identified by a structure-based virtual screening of compounds that fit into a surface groove of RAC1 known to be critical for GEF specification.On the other hand, RAC1 Inhibitor W56 is a peptide mimicking Trp (56) action interfering specifically by targeting RAC1 activation. This region between amino acids 53-72 of RAC1 is required for specific recognition and activation by the GEFs, and Trp (56) in beta (3) appears to be the critical determinant. Since NSC23766, being a compound has been reported to also affect M2 mAchR and GPCR, we have used another more specific peptide inhibitor of RAC1, W56 in our study. RAC1 and Cdc42 pull down assay kit was obtained from EMD Millipore. Wnt3Arecombinant protein (Recombinant Human Wnt-3a Protein) was purchased from R&D systems. Recombinant Human Wnt-3a protein was reconstituted at 200 \u03bcg/mL in sterile PBS containing at least 0.1% human or bovine serum albumin. LWnt3A cell lines and the parental cell line were procured from ATCC. DAPI and Phalloidin-555 were procured from molecular probes. Fibronectin was procured from BD Biosciences. Beta-catenin siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were obtained from Invitrogen Inc. Transwell was obtained from Cornning Inc. WP modulators, WntC59 and XAV939, were procured from Cellagen Technology.Biochemical analysisWe performed immunoblots by Western blots on the equivalent amounts of protein (Bradford assay) using clarified cell lysates as mentioned earlier. Cell lysates were assayed for total protein using BSA as standard. Normalized clarified lysates (25-50 \u03bcg protein) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Membranes were immunoblotted with different primary antibodies before individual bands on nitrocellulose membranes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) using UVP.Quantification of mRNA by qRT-PCRMDA-MB231BR and BT20 cells were plated in 6-well plates and stimulated with LWnt3A condition media (LWnt3A CM) in the absence and the presence of sulindac sulfide (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM). RNA was isolated from each sample using manufacturer's instructions (including on-column DNA digestion) via Qiagen RNEasy Mini kit (Cat 74104). RNA was analyzed for quality on a BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader. The pure RNA (250 ng of per sample) was used to convert to cDNA via manufacture's instruction for Bio-Rad iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix for RT-qPCR kit (Cat 1708841). cDNA samples were diluted 1:20 and used with FastStart Essential DNA Green Master Mix (Cat 06402712001) along with custom primers for each gene of interest and analyzed on a Roche LightCycler 96 RT-qPCR instrument per manufacturer's instructions. LightCycler 96 software was used to produce melting analysis and relative expression data. Primers listed below are 5\u2019-3\u2019.

Cycling conditions varied per gene target.RAC1 and Cdc42 pull-down assayGST-fusion protein pull-down assay was carried out using GST-fusion proteins, corresponding to the human PAK1 p21 binding domain (PBD, residues 67-150) expressed in E. coli. The final protein products were bound to glutathione agarose in liquid suspension, 300 \u03bcg of PAK1-PBD in 20 mM PBS, pH7.4, containing 50% glycerol. For the assay, 70-80% confluent cells were used for integrin engagement in the presence or absence of drugs on fibronectin-coated plates. Stimulated cells were lysed with extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepol CA630, 10 MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM NaF, and 1 mM Na-orthovanadate). Following centrifugation, 10 \u03bcl PAK1 PBD (1 \u03bcg/ml) was added per lysate sample for 45 minutes at 4\u00b0C with gentle rocking. Agarose beads were collected (by pulse centrifugation for 10 seconds at 14,000 rpm), washed in extraction buffer, and resuspended in 30 \u03bcl Laemmli sample buffer to resolve protein by 15% SDS-PAGE. The membrane was probed with monoclonal anti-RAC1 and polyclonal anti-Cdc42 antibodies.Transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNASilencing of beta-catenin in TNBC cells was carried out using siRNA. Cell lines were transiently transfected with human-specific beta-catenin siRNA (Invitrogen Inc.) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Inc.) as described earlier. In brief, cells grown in 6 well tissue culture plates were harvested following 72 hours of transfection with siRNA using Lipofectamine. Beta-catenin and active beta-catenin levels were determined by Western Blot.Integrin-directed migration and matrigel invasion AssaysHaptotaxis and wound healing assays were performed to test fibronectin-directed migration of tumor cells. Haptotaxis and matrigel invasion were carried out using transwell migration chambers. An adhesion assay on fibronectin was performed simultaneously with the haptotaxis assay under similar conditions. In vitro wound-healing migration assays were performed (scratch assay) as previously described by our group.Immunofluorescence staining of migrated cells in transwell migration following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNAThe migration on fibronectin was tested by transwell assay. Cells transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours were used for the migration for 24 hours. The cells which did not migrate were removed from the upper side of the wells. Membranes of transwells were cut after 24 hours of migration and processed for Phalloidin-555 and DAPI staining to identify the migrated cells only.Actin dynamics and podia-parameters by confocal microscopyTNBC cells were plated on fibronectin and treated with sulindac sulfide under conditions similar to that of the migration experiments. Cells were processed for Phalloidin-555 staining for filamentous actin. The nuclear localization of beta-catenin in the presence and absence of LWnt3A CM stimulation was stained with immunofluorescence (GFP) in MDA-MB231 cells. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cells were photographed using a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope with a 63 x (1.4-numerical-aperture) or 40 x (1.4-numerical-aperture) Plan-Apochromat oil objective as mentioned earlier. Lamellipodia/cell and filopodia/cell were identified under a confocal microscope. For the semi-quantification purpose, an equal number of cells from the control and treated experiments exhibiting, at least, one filopodia were chosen from randomly selected fields, and their screenshot images were collected. A total number of lamellipodia/cell and filopodia/cell from the control, as well as treated groups, were counted manually from these screenshot confocal images.LWnt3A conditioned media and Wnt3A recombinant proteinLWnt3A conditioned medium was obtained from the LWnt-3A (ATCC\u00ae CRL-2647\u2122) cells. These cells L-M(TK-) cells which were transfected with a Wnt-3A expression vector and stable clones were selected in medium containing G418. The Wnt3A gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein. The cells are engineered to secrete biologically active Wnt3A protein. We used these cells as our source for production of Wnt3A conditioned medium (Wnt3ACM) (as described by the ATCC). L Cells (ATCC\u00ae CRL2648\u2122) was used as the parental line for the LWnt3A cell line. Wnt3A recombinant protein was diluted as suggested by the manufacturer.Statistical analysisBiochemical experiments were independently repeated 3-4 times. Phenotypic experiments were performed in quadruplets. The Student's t-test was used to evaluate differences between treated and vehicle controls. Data presented in the graphs represent the Mean \u00b1 S.D. of results. The minimum level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Inter-group comparison was made with a paired two-tailed (Student's t-test).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL FIGURECONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.FUNDINGWe acknowledge Avera Cancer Institute, Sioux Falls, SD for funding this study.REFERENCESTumour-cell migration, invasion, and metastasis: navigation by neurotransmittersMetastasis: cell-autonomous mechanisms versus contributions by the tumor microenvironmentThe tumor microenvironment and its contribution to tumor evolution toward metastasisCell adhesion in tumor invasion and metastasis: loss of the glue is not enoughActive versus passive mechanisms in metastasis: do cancer cells crawl into vessels, or are they pushed?Directed cell invasion and migration during metastasisRasGRF suppresses Cdc42-mediated tumour cell movement, cytoskeletal dynamics and transformationLocomotion of tumor cells as an element of invasion and metastasisCell biology of the movement of breast cancer cells: intracellular signalling and the actin cytoskeletonCompensation mechanism in tumor cell migration: mesenchymal-amoeboid transition after blocking of pericellular proteolysisCell motility and cytoskeletal regulation in invasion and metastasisDissemination and growth of cancer cells in metastatic sitesFibronectin at a glanceIntegrin fibronectin receptors in matrix metalloproteinase-1-dependent invasion by breast cancer and mammary epithelial cellsbeta1 and beta4 integrins: from breast development to clinical practiceSignaling events mediated by alpha3beta1 integrin are essential for mammary tumorigenesisIntegrins in invasive growthExpression and prognostic significance of fibronectin and matrix metalloproteases in breast cancer metastasisDegradation of basement membrane by murine tumor cellsMolecular aspects of tumor cell migration and invasionRho GTPases in cancer cell biologyRho GTPases in cell biologyCell migration: Rho GTPases lead the wayCdc42 and Rac1 induce integrin-mediated cell motility and invasiveness through PI(3) KCofilin phosphorylation by LIM-kinase 1 and its role in Rac-mediated actin reorganizationrac and cdc42 GTPases: regulators of actin structures, cell adhesion and motilityRho GTPases and the actin cytoskeletonGTP-binding proteins of the Rho/Rac family: regulation, effectors and functions in vivo.

The specific group accounts for approximately 15\u201320% of all breast cancer is triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is defined by the lack of demonstrable expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or HER2 proteins. TNBC has a higher rate of distant recurrence and shorter overall survival in the metastatic setting compared with other subtypes of breast cancer. Metastatic TNBC is an aggressive disease and the median survival is less than one year. Almost all TNBC patients die from the progression of their disease despite adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, novel anti-cancer drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently needed.Recent studies indicated that solid tumors comprised not only neoplastic cells but also surrounded by a variety of non-neoplastic cells, most notably fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and immune cells that constitute a \u2018tumor microenvironment\u2019. The crosstalk between neoplastic cells and non-neoplastic cells plays an important role in tumor progression, and responses to antitumor therapy. The fibroblast is one of the most crucial components of tumor microenvironment, which promotes the remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and produces paracrine growth factors that control cell proliferation, survival and death. Such fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been reported to be associated with the progression of various cancer types such as prostate, pancreatic, head and neck and breast cancers. These results suggest that the stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues possess biological characteristics distinct from those of normal fibroblasts. However, the specific functional contributions of fibroblasts located in the interface zone between the normal zone and the tumor invasion front remain largely unknown.An approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by local invasion and distant metastasis, however, the mechanism underlying this event remains poorly defined. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a cellular process critical to normal morphogenesis, was recognized as an important mechanism for the initial step of metastasis. EMT results in loss of features characteristic of epithelial cells and acquisition of a mesenchymal nature. Recent studies have examined EMT in tumor invasion, chemoresistance, and the relationship between cancer stem cells. Some signals received from tumor microenvironments, such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), IL-6, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), can trigger EMT. It is important to examine the signals mediated by these microenvironment stimuli in initiating and controlling EMT and cancer metastasis.Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is an anthraquinone derivative present in the root and rhizome of Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae). This herb is widely used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. Emodin possesses a number of biological activities such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcerogenic, immunosuppressive, pro-apoptotic and chemopreventive activities. However, so far there is little evidence showing the possible effects of emodin on tumor invasion and metastasis.In the present study, we tested whether fibroblasts isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in tumor burden zones (CAFs), distal normal zones (NFs) and interface zones (INFs) contributed distinctive microenvironmental influences on TNBC. Our results demonstrated that fibroblasts isolated from different zones differed with respect to their ability to induce EMT. Moreover, we also tested whether emodin could inhibit the ability of different fibroblasts promoting TNBC progression. Our results found that emodin inhibited EMT induced by CAFs or INFs. These findings suggest that emodin is a promising candidate for TNBC prevention.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesThe compounds emodin and 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Human recombinant TGF-\u03b2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Primary antibodies against Snail, E-cadherin, \u03b2-cadherin, MMP-2 and Slug were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Primary antibody against vimentin was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). Primary antibodies against Twist were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Primary antibody against \u03b2-actin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG, were obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).Cell lines and cell culturesBT20 cells (ATCC\u00ae HTB-19\u2122) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). BT20 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator which provided an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at a constant temperature of 37\u00b0C. Materials used for cell cultures were purchased from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).Isolation of primary fibroblastsTNBC patients\u2019 tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan. The protocol for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of China Medical University Hospital (CMUH-104-REC2\u2013121). All participants signed written informed consent forms detailing tissue use for comprehensive experiments on breast cancer. We obtained tumor specimens from three zones: the normal zone (at least 10 mm distal normal tissue from the outer tumor boundary), interface zone (adjacent tissue within 5 mm of the outer tumor boundary) and tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary). The tumor specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remnant was used to isolate primary fibroblasts as described previously.Confocal microscopyCells were fixed for 20 min in 3% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 3% FBS for 20 minutes. The expression of E-cadherin or vimentin in the cells was analyzed through Leica confocal microscopy conducted using a monoclonal primary antibody. Nuclear staining was done with DAPI.Direct co-culture of fibroblasts and BT20 cellsThe CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells as described previously. CAFs, NFs, INFs or BT20 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM/F12 containing 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate; Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The solution was replaced with fresh, prewarmed medium for an additional 2 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then unstained fibroblasts or BT20 cells were seeded onto plates containing CMFDA-stained fibroblasts or BT20 cells, respectively. Finally, the co-cultures were incubated with medium (DMEM/F12, 1% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin with 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) for 1 week. Using confocal microscopy, CMFDA-stained cells were easily distinguished from unstained cells.Wound healing assayBT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs, respectively. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a sterile pipette tip and rinsed with PBS to remove cellular debris. Allow cells to grow and close the wound for 24 h. Wound closure was measured in ten random fields at 200X magnification using Image-Pro Express software and a NIKON TE2000-U Inverted Microscope. Data of three independent experiments were analyzed by t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software.Western blot analysisBriefly, cells in 10-cm culture dishes (1 \u00d7 106 per dish) were treated with the indicated in figure legends. Fifty micrograms of protein extract was loaded into sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gels, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were probed with the appropriate primary antibody. Western blotting was conducted as recently described.Statistical analysisAll values were expressed as mean \u00b1S.D. Each value was the mean of at least three individual experiments in each group. Student\u2019s t-test was used for statistical comparison. Asterisk indicates that the values were significantly different from the control (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001).ResultsComparison of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones of TNBC patients\u2019 tissuesWe first obtained representative TNBC patients\u2019 tissues from three zones: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone (Fig 1). Fibroblasts were isolated from TNBC patients\u2019 tissues in the normal, interface and tumor zones, which were correspondingly designated as NFs, INFs and CAFs, respectively. Our study found that each type of fibroblast obtained from two patients possessed the basic fibroblast characteristics of an identical and long spindle-shaped morphology. Moreover, the strong expression of fibroblastic marker vimentin and being negative for epithelial marker E-cadherin in each type of fibroblast (Fig 2A). Oppositely, a human mammary epithelial cell line BT20 cells displayed an up-regulation of epithelial marker (Fig 2A). To compare the growth rate of primary fibroblasts isolated from different zones, we counted the cell number. After seeding at the same density (5,000 cells/well) in 6-well plates and culturing for 4 days, the number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (Fig 2B).Collection of representative TNBC patient\u2019s tissue.TNBC patient\u2019s tissue was grossly divided into three distinct regions: the tumor zone, interface zone and normal zone. For subsequent fibroblasts isolation, the histological analysis was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and a representative sample of tissue was collected from three distinct regions.Comparison of primary fibroblasts from three distinct regions.(A) Normal zone fibroblasts (NFs), interface zone fibroblasts (INFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were obtained from two patients. Each type of fibroblasts and BT20 cells were examined by phase-contrast microscopy and immunostaining for E-cadherin and vimentin; nuclei were stained with DAPI. (B) NFs, INFs, and CAFs seeded at the same density (5000 cells/well) in 6-well plates for 5 days. Cell numbers were calculated by Trypan Blue assay under the same experimental conditions. The number of INFs was increased relative to NFs and CAFs (*, p < 0.05).INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in TNBC cellsRecent study found that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT. To determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to modulate tumor progression, the conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected and used to culture BT20 cells. As shown in Fig 3A and S1 File, the epithelial BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM showed more spindle-like shape and cell scattering than cultured with NFs-CM. To investigate the changes of EMT phenotype induced by NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM in BT20 cells, we examined the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin. Our results showed that BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM had decreased expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, and increased expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin (Fig 3B). The expression levels of mesenchymal marker MMP2, Snail, Slug and Twist were upregulated in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM (Fig 3C). These factors secreted by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM could induce the EMT phenotype in BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The conditioned medium of NFs (NFs-CM), INFs (INFs-CM) and CAFs (CAFs-CM) were collected in 24 h and 48 h and used to culture BT20 cells for 24 h (24\u201324, 48\u201324) and 48 h (24\u201348, 48\u201348). Phase-contrast pictures were taken using a 103 objective. (B) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with NFs-CM, INFs-CM and CAFs-CM for indicated time periods. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of MMP-2, snail, slug, twist, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells in an in vitro co-culture modelTo further determine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs had different capacities to induce the EMT phenotype, we co-cultured NFs, INFs and CAFs directly with BT20 cells, allowing direct cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction. We examined the expression of mesenchymal marker vimentin (red) after co-culture BT20 cells and CMFDA-stained (green) fluorescent fibroblasts by immunofluorescence staining. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs showed higher percentage of vimentin-positive cells than did those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4A). The results indicated that INFs or CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in co-cultured BT20 cells.INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in an in vitro co-culture model.(A) The CAFs, NFs, and INFs were directly co-cultured with BT20 cells. The adherent CAFs, NFs, and INFs or BT20 cells were stained by 5 \u03bcM CMFDA. CMFDA-stained fibroblasts (green) were distinguished from unstained cancer cells. Immunofluorescence staining for vimentin (red) in co-cultures of BT-20 and fibroblasts. (B) BT20 cells grown to approximately 50% confluence were pre-stained with CMFDA and then co-cultured with CAFs, NFs, or INFs. Cells were allowed to grow to 100% confluence and then scratched by a plastic tip and washed by PBS to remove cell debris. The cells were incubated for 12 h to allow cells to grow and close the wound. The cell motility data are plotted as means with S.D.INFs or CAFs promoted cancer cell migration under co-culture conditionsCancer cells enhanced ability of migration and invasion through EMT. To examine whether NFs, INFs and CAFs promoted BT20 cells migration, we performed a wound healing assay under direct co-culture of BT20 cells with different types of fibroblasts. After scratching, BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was assessed. Direct co-culture of BT20 cells with INFs or CAFs, phase contrast microscopic observation indicated that the size of the wound area was lower than those co-cultured with NFs (Fig 4B). Moreover, fluorescent photomicrographs showed that CMFDA-stained BT20 cells (green) were observed to migrate into the wound area in the co-cultures of INFs or CAFs (Fig 4B). The results indicated that INFs and CAFs were able to promote BT20 cell migration. Interestingly, INFs possessed the more potent effect on migratory behavior than CAFs.EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin in BT20 cells cultured with INFs-CM or CAFs-CMPrevious study indicated that emodin inhibits the migration, invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells. To test whether INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype were blocked by emodin. Emodin was added to INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for culturing BT20 cells. Then, the changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM with or without emodin for 24 and 48 h. Emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced BT20 cells spindle-like shape and cell scattering (Fig 5A). We next examined the expression of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, \u03b2-catenin and MMP-2) and found that increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by INFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5B). Furthermore, increased mesenchymal markers stimulated by CAFs-CM were reversed by adding emodin in BT20 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 5C). These results indicated that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin inhibited INFs and CAFs induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.(A) The changes in cell morphology were assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with INFs-CM or CAFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. Emodin can reverse the EMT properties from fibroblastic shape recover to the cobble-stone shaped. (B) BT20 cells were treated with INFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. (C) BT20 cells were treated with CNFs-CM for indicated time periods with or without 30 \u03bcM emodin. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, MMP-2, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments.TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsCAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 promote human breast cancer cells proliferation. We next determined whether CAFs and INFs-secreted TGF-\u03b2 initiated EMT in TNBC cells. The cell morphology was assessed following treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. After treatment with TGF-\u03b2, BT20 cells altered their morphology to assume more of a fibroblast-like appearance and reduced their cell-cell contact (S2 Fig in S1 File). After treatment of BT20 cells with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, the expressions of the epithelial phenotype marker (E-cadherin) and mesenchymal phenotype marker (vimentin) were determined. TGF-\u03b2 decreased E-cadherin expression and increased vimentin expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A). These results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cells.Emodin blocks TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in BT20 cells.(A) BT20 cells were treated with various concentrations (1\u201310 ng/mL) of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (B) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or 20 \u03bcM emodin for indicated time periods and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. (C) BT20 cells were pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h and then stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/mL) for 24 h. The cells were harvested and lysed for the detection of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \u03b2-actin. Western blot data presented are representative of those obtained in at least 3 separate experiments. (D) For wound healing assay, confluent BT20 monolayer was pretreated with DMSO (control) or increasing emodin concentrations (5\u201320 \u03bcM) for 2 h, cells were scratched by pipette tips and washed to remove the debris and following by fresh medium containing 0.5% serum with emodin. Cells were then incubated with 2 ng/mL TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility was determined by measuring the closure of wound. Data were plotted by mean \u00b1 S.D. (n = 3). The closure distance of the control cells was set to 1. Emodin significantly inhibited TGF-\u03b2-induced cell motility (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01).Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype in BT20 cellsTo determine whether emodin affected the TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT programming and phenotype, BT20 cells were pretreated with emodin prior to stimulation with TGF-\u03b2. Pretreatment with emodin significantly restored the TGF-\u03b2-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig 6B and 6C). We next examined whether emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration. Pretreated confluent BT20 cells with various concentrations of emodin for 2 h, cells were scratched and then incubated with 2 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h. BT20 cells were allowed to recover and their capacity to migrate and fill the wound area was determined by measuring the wound closure assessed. Our results indicated that TGF-\u03b2 significantly induced cell migration, however, the TGF-\u03b2-induced cell migration was inhibited by emodin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6D).DiscussionTraditionally, most anticancer drugs are designed to kill tumor cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that cancers not only contain tumor cells but also have very complex substances with multiple components involved in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Fibroblasts are a major component of solid tumors and associated with cancer cells at all stages of cancer progression. In the present study, we demonstrated the differential interactions between fibroblasts from different tumor zones and TNBC cells. Our study found that CAFs and INFs grown with human TNBC BT20 cells dramatically promoted cell migration and induced an EMT process. Under the same experimental conditions, this effect was not detected or was weaker when NFs were grown with BT20 cells. Importantly, INFs were more competent in promoting these changes in BT20 cells than were CAFs. Targeting these cells through suppressing their supportive procarcinogenic paracrine effects is mandatory for improving the current therapies that are mainly targeting TNBC. To this end, we tested the effect of emodin in suppressing the carcinogenic effects of active CAFs and INFs. We have shown that emodin inhibited INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT programming and phenotype.Fibroblasts are a key determinant in the malignant progression of cancer cells through the involvement in progressive genetic instability, angiogenesis, EMT, deregulation of anti-tumor immune responses, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent reports indicated that CAFs could promote aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells. Yu et al demonstrated that CAFs promoted aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer cells through EMT induced by paracrine TGF-\u03b21. Al-Ansari et al demonstrated that p16(INK4A) downregulation in breast stromal fibroblasts is an important step toward their migration and invasion by inducing EMT. Lebret et al demonstrated a role for CAFs, but not for NFs, in increasing the migratory ability of PMC42-LA cells. In this study, we demonstrated that CAFs enhanced the aggressive behaviors and migration in TNBC cells by inducing or promoting EMT. Collectively, these results suggested that CAFs could promote migration and invasion through induction of EMT in various types of breast cancer cells.Compared with normal fibroblasts, our and previous data demonstrated that CAFs possess different biological properties and functions. However, the biological and molecular characterization of fibroblasts located in the interface zone remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that INFs were more potential in inducing EMT in TNBC cells than were CAFs. INFs-CM decreased the expression of E-cadherin, and increased the expression of vimentin and \u03b2-cadherin higher than that induced by CAFs-CM. Moreover, a number of studies have reported that invasion markers in tumor tissues are most dynamic and active within the interface zone, where active cancer invasion or EMT occurs. From these results, we concluded that INFs may be the primary fibroblasts involved in the remodeling of cells and tissue during invasion and metastasis of TNBC cells.Non-toxic natural compounds that can inhibit cancer-stroma crosstalk by normalizing the tumor microenvironment may boost the traditional tumor cell\u2013directed therapy. It has been reported that emodin significantly inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. However, so far there is little evidence on whether emodin may also influence the interaction between tumor cells and normal fibroblasts. In the current work, we clarified the role of emodin in tumor microenvironment. EMT related changes induced by INFs-CM or CAFs-CM in BT20 cells could be discerned at both morphological and molecular levels. Interestingly, emodin would reverse all INFs-CM or CAFs-CM-induced EMT related changes in BT20 cells. Chen T et al., found that emodin ameliorated glucose-induced EMT and subsequent podocyte dysfunction partly through integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which might provide a potential novel therapeutic option for diabetic kidney disease. Our previous study also found that emodin inhibited TWIST1-induced EMT by inhibiting the \u03b2-catenin and Akt pathways. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 by the CK2\u03b1 activity inhibitor emodin decreased the expression levels of vimentin and the transcription factors snail1 and smad2/3, and increased the expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these findings uncover an important role for emodin as a potent inhibitor of EMT.Several subsequent studies established crucial roles of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT in tumor progression. Recently, the effect of emodin on TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and its functional relevance to proliferation, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells have been identified. Thacker PC et al., found that emodin downregulated the TGF-\u03b2 activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in human cervical cancer cells. Herein, in agreement with previous reports, we showed that TGF-\u03b2 induced EMT in TNBC cells and this process could be effectively blocked by emodin. Emodin blocked TGF-\u03b2-induced scattering and spindle-like morphology. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 downregulated E-cadherin and upregulated vimentin was significantly inhibited by emodin.In conclusion, it is suggested that INFs from the interface zone of the TNBC patients\u2019 tissues may have a potential dynamic region that is a key factor leading to TNBC progression and metastasis. Emodin may prevent the activation of fibroblasts and also avert the EMT related changes induced in epithelial tumor cells by INFs-CM. These results lead us to suggest emodin as a potential new treatment agent for TNBC.Supporting InformationAbbreviationsCAFscancer-associated

TNBC is characterized by high intra-tumoral heterogeneity and plasticity, which dictate multiple malignant signs, including treatment resistance and metastasis. Rapid spread of metastases remains the main obstacle for a positive clinical outcome. This aggressive spread is encouraged by the tumor microenvironment (TME), which actively participates in all stages of tumor progression and is now recognized as a cancer hallmark. In breast cancer, the TME is composed mainly of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are generally derived from the surrounding stroma and can be recruited by cancer cells to endorse different tumor functions, in particular invasion and metastasis.Research on CAFs has grown in recent years and has been focused in particular on the distinct subspecializations CAFs acquire during cancer. CAFs are the most effective cells in the TME in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling because of their capacity for enzyme-mediated ECM degradation and force-dependent ECM reshuffling. In this scenario, extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, have been found to be important mediators, particularly in the crosstalk between cancer and the TME through transfer of biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), that sustain cancer development and progression.Dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer has been shown extensively to influence cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, stem phenotype, and resistance to therapies. Therefore, miRNA profiling has been employed for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction in affected individuals.For example, the tumor suppressor miR-34 family is recognized as one of the most significant in cancer and is investigated in numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies. A miR-34a mimic-based drug was employed in the MRX34 clinical trial (NCT01829971), which was the first-in-human phase 1 study of miRNA-based cancer therapy. Even though the clinical trial terminated prematurely, it was the first concrete application of miRNAs in the clinic and a solid proof of concept for miRNA-based cancer therapy.MiRNAs can be loaded selectively into the exosomes released by cancer cells and directed to their extracellular target compartments, contributing to regulation of different tumor processes, including recruitment of cellular components from the TME.Here we investigated whether TNBC-derived exosomes and their miRNA cargo may affect conversion of fibroblasts into a CAF-like phenotype in the TME. Our results show that exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate stromal fibroblasts by promoting a specific pro-migratory functional state that could serve for TNBC cell migration and invasion.ResultsBreast cancer-derived exosomes are transferred to normal fibroblastsTo study whether the crosstalk between breast cancer cells and surrounding fibroblasts is also mediated by exosomes, we isolated exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells through a polymeric precipitation method (ExoQuickTC, System Biosciences [SBI]). The tumoral exosomes were then characterized by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and western blot analysis.. MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes: characterization and fibroblast uptake(A) Results from the NTA performed on MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes. The peak (at 105\u00a0nm) indicates the mean ratio of vesicle size and concentration derived from three measurements. (B) Western blot showing expression of exosome-specific markers (CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101) in MDA-MB-231 cells and exosomes and the absence of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein Calnexin. (C) Representative TEM images of exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cells (scale bar, 500\u00a0nm). A yellow square indicates a larger magnification (scale bar, 100\u00a0nm). (D) Immunofluorescence assay performed on NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes labeled with PKH26 dye. The images from confocal microscopy show co-localization of the red signal derived from PKH26-labeled exosomes and the green signal from FITC-conjugated anti-\u03b2-actin (merged), indicative of exosome uptake by NFs. Magnification, 63\u00d7.NTA, performed with the Nanosight NS300 system equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm), revealed that there was a major particle size peak at approximately 105\u00a0nm, corresponding to the mean diameter of exosomes (Figure\u00a01A). Western blotting revealed expression of the typical exosomal protein markers CD63, CD81, CD9, and Tsg101 and absence of the endoplasmic reticular protein Calnexin, indicating no cellular contamination (Figure\u00a01B). Then the morphology of exosomes was analyzed by TEM (Figure\u00a01C). These data confirmed the exosomal origin of isolated vesicles.To determine whether there was a transfer of breast cancer-derived exosomes to normal fibroblasts, we took advantage of primary stromal fibroblasts derived from surgical resection of normal breast tissues and/or fibroadenomas. Because of the benign origin of fibroadenoma, we chose to define fibroblasts isolated from this tumor by convention as normal fibroblasts (NFs). Primary fibroblasts were derived from three female individuals (pt. #1, #2, and #3) between 21 and 44 years of age and presenting with various clinicopathological features, including two fibroadenomas (pt. #1 and #2) and one mammary reduction (pt. #3) without any pathological signs. PKH26-labeled MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes were then incubated for 12\u00a0h with NFs (pt. #1) and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. We observed that PKH26-labeled exosomes were distinctly taken up by NFs. Confocal microscopy indicated co-localization of PKH26 derived from exosomes and \u03b2-actin from NFs (Figure\u00a01D), confirming that NFs actively took up breast cancer-derived exosomes.MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes promote a CAF-like phenotype in NFs.

Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (FAP and SLC2A1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0014; SLC16A3, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00064; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014).Cell contractility and motility are regarded as major hallmarks of activated CAFs in the TME to foster cancer cell invasion. Therefore, we assessed the effect of breast cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblast-mediated collagen contraction. NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) were plated in a type 1 collagen matrix and incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS (control) to examine their contraction ability. After 24 h, we observed that NFs cultured in the presence of exosomes reduced the collagen plug area compared with control NFs, indicating increased cell contractility mediated by exosomes (Figures 2A and 2B).To verify whether breast cancer-derived exosomes affected the migration potential of fibroblasts, we pre-treated NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h and then performed a Transwell migration assay. We found improved migration when NFs were cultured in the presence of exosomes (Figures 2C and 2D). Then, to assess the progression of NFs toward a CAF-like phenotype, the expression of molecular markers usually associated with the CAF phenotype was examined. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the levels of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, and SLC2A1 mRNAs in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes for 48h. The presence of exosomes was associated with upregulation of these genes, supporting the notion of fibroblasts being converted to a CAF-like phenotype (Figure\u00a02E).Exosome-activated fibroblasts induce invasion in normal breast epithelial cells3D Organotypic invasion assay of normal breast epithelial cells in a matrix containing exosome-activated fibroblasts(A) Left panel: representative phase-contrast images of a collagen matrix-embedded section (10-\u03bcm slides) showing MCF10A cell invasion through the matrix when three-dimensionally co-cultured with NFs (pt. #3) incubated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (+ exosomes) or PBS (NT). Right panel: confocal microscopy images of collagen matrix sections showing MCF10A cells stained with DAPI for nuclei (blue signal) and Alexa 594-conjugated anti-pan-cytokeratin antibody (red signal) as an epithelial marker. (B) Histogram of the number of invading MCF10A cells (NFs\u00a0+ exosomes and NFs_NT), calculated for different fields of confocal microscopy images. Standard deviations were calculated on technical replicates. The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001.To investigate the effects of fibroblast activation in the TME, we carried out three-dimensional cell-cell interaction modeling by setting up an in\u00a0vitro invasion organotypic assay, as reported previously. NFs (pt. #3) were seeded on a type 1 collagen matrix and then cultured in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 48\u00a0h to ensure fibroblast activation. Subsequently, normal breast epithelial cells (cell line MCF10A) were seeded on top\u00a0of\u00a0the fibroblast-containing collagen matrix for 14\u00a0days, which was transferred to an invasion grid and finally paraffin embedded for analysis. Activation of NFs induced by the presence of exosomes\u00a0increased the number of MCF10A cells invading the matrix, as demonstrated by the positive pan-cytokeratin signal from cells stained in the collagen section (Figures 3A and 3B). These data suggest that MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes have a pro-tumor stromal function triggering NFs to a CAF-like phenotype. Our organotypic assay outlined how the effect of cancer-derived exosomes on fibroblasts contributes to malignant transformation promoting the invasion capacity of non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells.miRNA expression profile of breast cancer exosomesDifferentially expressed miRNAs in fibroblasts upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes(A) Heatmap of data from small RNA sequencing analysis, showing miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs (pt. #1) incubated with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes (+exosomes) and PBS (NT).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0317; \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0008).

The p values were calculated using unpaired t\u00a0test (\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0210; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0027). (D) Representative images of the EXOmotif analysis with MDS software showing a short motif (3\u20135 nt) in miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 sequences, predictive of their active loading into exosomes.

(F) Histogram of densitometric measurement of bands, obtained with ImageJ. Quantification of protein expression is represented as the mean of folded densitometry from NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (FAP, \u2217\u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0< 0.0001; MCT4, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0019; Caveolin-1, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0016).To investigate whether the breast cancer exosomal cargo was involved in fibroblast activation in the TME, we performed small RNA sequencing to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in NFs cultured with MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomes or PBS for 24 h. We found that 14 miRNAs were upregulated significantly in NFs (pt. #1) when exposed to exosomes (Figure\u00a04A). We then\u00a0focused our attention on miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 because they have been demonstrated to be upregulated in NFs upon MDA-MB-231-derived exosome incubation (Figure\u00a04B). The basal expression levels of these three miRNAs were higher in CAFs compared with NFs (Figure\u00a04C), indicating that they are involved in fibroblast activation. We found that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were predicted to be actively sorted into exosomes by the Motif Discovery on Short Nucleotide Sequences (MDS) bioinformatic tool (http://cse-jcui-08.unl.edu:7000/input), as described previously. We found short-sequence motifs (EXOmotifs) in the three miRNAs that predicted their loading into exosomes (Figure\u00a04D). Based on the prediction results, we investigated whether the three miRNAs were loaded into exosomes by adopting an overexpression model. We transfected miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and a scramble sequence (as a control) in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Then we isolated exosomes and performed qRT-PCR to check the expression levels of the three miRNAs in cells and in the relative exosomes. We found that consistent portions of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 were overexpressed in MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (Figure\u00a0S1), indicating that they were loaded into exosomes. These findings directed us to study these three miRNAs among the other upregulated miRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing. We then investigated whether the miRNAs shuttled via breast cancer-derived exosomes trigger NF conversion to CAFs. We found that transfection of the individual miRNAs had no significant biological effects on fibroblast activation, as shown by western blotting for FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1, known markers associated with the CAF phenotype (Figures S2A and S2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 might work synergistically, as already reported for miR-185-5p. We found that combined transfection of the three miRNAs (combo miRs) was associated with upregulated CAF markers (FAP, MCT4, and Caveolin-1) in NFs derived from all three individuals (Figures 4E and 4F).Exosomal miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically activate fibroblasts toward a pro-migratory functional phenotypeCombo miRs promote fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling(A) Representative pictures of collagen plugs containing NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra taken after 24 h.

(F) Histograms of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cells (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p values were calculated using multiple t test with FDR adjustment (MMP1, \u2217p\u00a0= 0.023; MMP2, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00087; MMP3, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0035; ITGB1, \u2217\u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.00014; ITGA5, \u2217\u2217p\u00a0= 0.0054).The main ability acquired by CAFs in the TME is ECM remodeling, a process promoting permissive tracks for cancer cell invasion. Our results so far demonstrated that the combo miRs mediated activation of NFs by primarily boosting their motility in the ECM. To explore this, we set up a collagen contraction assay, plating NFs pre-transfected with combo miRs or a scrambled control onto type 1 collagen matrices. We found that the synergistic action of the three miRNAs promoted fibroblast collagen contraction, as shown by reduction of the collagen plug area in combo miR-transfected NFs (Figures 5A and 5B).We then investigated the invasion potential of fibroblasts, specifically their ability to move within the ECM as a result of its degradation. We transfected NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) with combo miRs and performed a Transwell invasion assay, seeding the cells in a Matrigel solution plated on top of the migration chamber, simulating the three-dimensional ECM. We observed increased invasion by NFs transfected with combo miRs, as demonstrated by the higher absorbance values of crystal violet eluted from migrated cells (Figures 5C and 5D).Considering that ECM remodeling depends on force-mediated and protease-dependent mechanisms, we investigated integrin (ITG) and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) expression in NFs after combo miR overexpression. We conducted western blot analysis for expression of ITGB1 and ITGA5 proteins, major players in mechanical force-mediated cell invasion and ECM modeling, especially during CAF transformation. We found that ITGB1 and ITGA5 were increased in NFs transfected with combo miRs after 72\u00a0h (Figures 5E and 5F), suggesting that there was a higher driving force exerted by fibroblasts to contract the collagen matrix. However, the protease activity involved in matrix degradation is arbitrated by different members of the MMP protein family. In particular, MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 are mainly upregulated in breast cancer stroma under the influence of cancer cells. We found that, after 48\u00a0h of transfection, combo miRs led to increased levels of MMP1, MMP2, and MMP3, justifying the boost in fibroblast invasion potential (Figures 5E and 5F).Combo miRs promote migration of NFs(A) Wound healing assay performed with NFs transfected with combo miRs or Scra. Shown are representative images of NFs in bright fields 0 and 24\u00a0h from scratch. Bars indicate size, expressed in pixels.

(E) Western blot showing overexpression of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/577) protein in NFs transfected with combo miRs compared with Scra after 72 h. (F) Histogram of mean densitometric measurement of bands (ImageJ) for NFs transfected with combo miRs over Scra. Standard deviations were calculated on replicates from two independent experiments performed on three different NF cell lines (pt. #1, #2, and #3). The p value was calculated using two-tailed unpaired t test; \u2217p\u00a0= 0.029.We found that combo miRs promoted a pro-migratory phenotype in NFs, as demonstrated by Transwell migration and scratch assays (Figures 6A\u20136D). To corroborate these results, we investigated expression of FAK, the main regulator of focal adhesion turnover responsible for cell movement. We found upregulation of the activated form of FAK protein (phosphorylated at Y576/577) using western blot analysis (Figures 6E and 6F) in NFs (pt. #1, #2, and #3) transfected with combo miRs, indicating activation of the molecular pathway involved in cell migration. These data demonstrated that miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246 synergistically foster a pro-migratory functional state in NFs in the TME.DiscussionThe data presented here shed light on the role of exosomes in the crosstalk between the TME and breast cancer cells. Our results strengthen knowledge of the mechanisms adopted by breast cancer cells to potentiate the oncogenic phenotype of neighboring cells in the TME. We demonstrate that TNBC-derived exosomes and the miRNA cargo they hold activate stromal fibroblasts to obtain a specific pro-migratory functional phenotype, potentially enabling tumor invasion and metastasis.It is known that fibroblasts are recruited by cancer cells in the TME to support different tumor traits. However, the major obstacle when studying CAFs is high functional heterogeneity and lack of specific molecular markers defining their status, even considering occasional antitumorigenic roles. However, some researchers have tried to associate precise gene signatures with CAF subtypes. In our case, fibroblast activation mediated by cancer cell exosomal miRNAs was associated with upregulation of MCT4, FAP, and Caveolin-1, among other canonical CAF markers. The role of Caveolin-1 in CAF activation is controversial. In fact, some studies have demonstrated that loss of Caveolin-1 expression is a trait associated with CAF transformation. In contrast, our data are in line with those of Goetz et\u00a0al. showing that the presence of Caveolin-1-enriched CAFs correlates with tumor invasion and metastasis by promoting biomechanical remodeling of tumoral stroma.In the context of the breast cancer TME, intracellular and extracellular miRNAs have been reported widely to mediate the crosstalk between CAFs and cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence supporting the notion that breast cancer cell exosomal miRNAs induce a CAF-related pro-migratory phenotype rather than a proliferative pro-survival one. No significant effect on activation of proliferative and survival pathways mediated by combo miRs was observed (Figures S3A and S3B), as shown by cell viability assay and western blotting for phosphorylated AKT serine/threonine kinase (S473) and phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (S33/37/T41), known markers of cell proliferation, self-renewal, and survival in cancer. In contrast, delivery to fibroblasts of the breast-cancer-cell exosomal combo miRs induced the former to increase migration, contraction, and invasion, characteristics acquired by specific CAF subtypes. Otherwise, incubation of NFs with MCF10A-derived exosomes, which presented lower levels of two of the three miRNAs, showed no effect on fibroblast migration, indicating the presence of a specific mechanism related to the combined exosomal miRNA function (Figures S4A and S4B). Overexpression in fibroblasts of combo miRs induced expression of MMPs (types 1, 2, and 3) and ITGs (\u03b15 and \u03b21 subunits) and increased FAK phosphorylation (Y576/577), components of major pathways involved in cancer cell invasion and motility, because they operate in protease-dependent ECM remodeling and cellular movement.Although breast cancer prognosis has improved with development of molecular targeted therapies, treatment of TNBC is still a challenge because of its highly invasive nature and relatively low response rate. These adverse clinicopathological aspects are often caused by CAFs populating the activated tumoral stroma and the exosomal cargo shed by cancer cells into the surrounding TME. Thus, discovering new molecular targets for TNBC prognosis and drug response prediction has become fundamental. Regarding this point, our study shows that three exosomal miRNAs (miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, and miR-1246) act synergistically to promote fibroblast transformation in the context of TNBC.In individuals with severe active alopecia, miR-185-5p has already been reported to work in synergy with other miRNAs rather than alone, a finding coherent with our initial hypothesis. Upregulation of this miRNA has been observed specifically in lymph nodes with metastases from breast cancer; similarly, it has emerged as a prognostic factor of radiation-related toxicity in the serum of individuals with oropharyngeal cancer and as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response and metastasis formation in colorectal and gastric cancer.miR-652-5p has been reported to be upregulated in breast malignancies. However, decreased expression of this miRNA is correlated with esophageal carcinoma progression and recurrence. This difference could be explained by the fact that miRNAs can operate in different ways depending on the biological system in which they are acting.miR-1246 is a well-known master regulator in cancer. In particular, its upregulation has been associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance in different types of cancer. In breast cancer, exosomal miR-1246 has been used as diagnostic biomarker because of its high expression specificity.Given the considerable role of these miRNAs in cancer, the novelty of our study lies in the combined effect exerted by these exosomal miRNAs on fibroblast activation in the TME. This could reflect the existence of a specific miRNA profile in the tumor cells\u2019 exosomal cargos, with a well-defined scope of action.Our results demonstrate that exosomes encourage breast cancer development by delivering specific miRNAs that stimulate formation of a singular and aggressive TME. These findings may aid development of novel, alternative strategies for TNBC theragnostics. Better comprehension of the mechanisms underlying the behavior of CAFs in the context of a tumor may help to adapt them for specific clinical benefits.Materials and methodsPrimary and continuous cells culturesPrimary cultures of fibroblasts (NFs) were obtained from individuals undergoing breast reduction surgery at Mediterranea Cardiocentro (Naples, Italy). Informed consent was obtained before sample collection. This study was conducted according to the criteria set by the declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Naples Federico II (119/15ES1) and A.S.L. Napoli 1 (247/C.E.-20/2021Oss). Briefly, human breast specimens were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile blades and tongs. The ECM was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, Code(Cod.) C5138) for 2\u00a0h under continuous agitation (200\u00a0rpm) at 37\u00b0C. Then the cellular suspension was centrifuged to separate epithelial cells from the fibroblast population (200\u00a0rpm for 2\u00a0min to obtain a pellet of epithelial cells and 1,300\u00a0rpm for 5\u00a0min to obtain the fibroblast population). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium/nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8437, lot RNBG9065) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. F7524, lot BCBW0228), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (A/A; Gibco, Cod. 15240-062, lot 2321085), and 1% amphotericin B (Gibco, Cod. 15290-026, lot 2244434) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The breast cancer continuous cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. R8758, lot RNBF0094) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% A/A. The normal breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A (ATCC) was cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, 1% A/A, 1% amphotericin B, and all hormones and factors needed for their growth: epidermal growth factor (EGF; 1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), hydrocortisone (1\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), cholera toxin (100\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL), and insulin (20\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcL). All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of MDA-MB-231 cells. 4\u00a0\u00d7 106 cells were plated in 150\u00a0\u00d7 25\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430599) with their usual growth medium (described in the previous section) to allow plate attachment. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco\u2019s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12\u00a0mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 15\u00a0min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4\u00b0C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 30\u00a0min and then at 1,500\u00a0\u00d7 g for 5\u00a0min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS solution.NTAExosome size and particle number were analyzed using the NS300 nanoparticle characterization system (NanoSight; Alfatest, Rome, Italy) equipped with a blue laser (405\u00a0nm). In brief, 40\u00a0\u03bcL of exosome isolation (see \u201cExosome Isolation\u201d) was diluted with PBS to a final volume of 400\u00a0\u03bcL and loaded into the instrument. For the measurement, the instrument\u2019s software (NTA 3.1 Build 3.1.54) was used. The capture settings were as follows: camera type, scientific CMOS camera (sCMOS); camera level, 15; slider shutter, 1,206; slider gain, 366; Frame Per Second (FPS), 25.0; number of frames, 1,498; temperature, 24.6\u00b0C\u201324.7\u00b0C; viscosity (water), 0.895\u20130.897 centipoises (cP); dilution factor, 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0\u00d7 102; syringe pump speed, 20. The analysis settings were as follows: detection threshold, 5; blur size, auto; max jump distance, auto (12.3\u201312.9 pixels). Sample measurement was performed in triplicate.TEMTEM imaging was carried out at the Department of Radiology of Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). Carbon-coated grids (formvar/carbon on 200-mesh copper; AGS162; Van Loenen Instruments, Zaandam, the Netherlands) were glow discharged for 1\u00a0min at 2\u00a0\u00d7 10\u22121 mbar and 20 mA using the Emitech K950X Turbo Evaporator (Quorum Technologies, Ashford, UK). Then 3\u00a0\u03bcL of sample solution was transferred to the glow-discharged grid and left for 1\u00a0min to adhere. Excess liquid was blotted onto filter paper, and 3\u00a0\u03bcL of 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water was applied to the grid for negative staining. Excess uranyl acetate was removed by blotting after 1\u00a0min, and the sample was air dried for 10\u00a0min. Grids were placed on an RT holder and observed at a voltage of 120 kV with a Tecnai 12 Twin (FEI; OR, USA) fitted with a OneView camera, model 1095 (Gatan; Pleasanton, CA, USA). DigitalMicrograph 3.4 was used to capture and save digital images (Gatan).Cell transfection and exosome treatmentNFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60\u00a0\u00d7 15\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 353004), and a combination of miRNA precursor (pre-miR)-185-5p, pre-miR-652-5p, and pre-miR-1246 (combo miRs) as well as pre-miRNA-scramble (Ambion, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) was transiently transfected at a final concentration of 150\u00a0\u03bcM for each transfection point using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy; Cod. 12252-011, lot 2030861) under reduced serum conditions (Opti-MEM, Gibco, Cod. 31985-047, lot 2091581). After 4 h, the cell medium was supplemented with a final concentration of 10% FBS to restore optimal cell growth conditions. Cells were collected at 24, 48, and/or 72\u00a0h of transfection for downstream analysis or applications. Exosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells were quantized using Bradford reagent (a protein assay dye, Bio- Rad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929), and a total amount of 40\u00a0\u03bcg was used for NF treatments. Briefly, NFs (2.5\u00a0\u00d7 10) were seeded in 60-mm dishes in 10% FBS-DMEM-F12 as long as they get attached, then washed twice with PBS solution and kept in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS for the exosome treatment. Last, NFs were collected after 24 and/or 48\u00a0h for downstream analysis.Exosome labeling and immunofluorescence assayExosomes isolated from MDA-MB-231cells (see \u201cExosome isolation and characterization\u201d) were labeled with the red fluorescent cell membrane linker PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich, SLBT6344). Briefly, exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) were stained with PKH26 (0.33\u00a0\u03bcL) for 5\u00a0min in the dark at RT in a final reaction volume of 2\u00a0mL. Then the same amount of 1% BSA (2\u00a0mL) was added to stop the labeling reaction. Finally, samples were ultracentrifuged (Beckman Coulter, Optima MAX) twice at 100,000\u00a0\u00d7 g for 70\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C, and pellets were resuspended in 500\u00a0\u03bcL of PBS. For the immunofluorescence assay, 5\u00a0\u00d7 105 NFs were plated on glass coverslips in a 24-well plate. The following day, NFs were treated with PKH26-labelled exosomes for 12 h, washed three times with PBS, and finally fixed with MetOH/acetone 1:1 for 10\u00a0min at \u221220\u00b0. After 3 washes in PBS, cells were blocked in 1% PBS-BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number 9002-93-1) solution at RT for 15\u00a0min. Subsequently, cells were stained with anti- \u03b2-actin primary antibody (1:1,000) diluted in blocking solution for 1\u00a0h at RT for cytoskeleton detection. After 3 washes in PBS, the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, F0211, 1:300 in PBS), was added for 30\u00a0min at RT. Last, cells were incubated with DAPI (BD Pharmingen, catalog number 564907, 1:1,000 in PBS) for 10\u00a0min at RT in the dark for nucleus visualization. Coverslips were washed and mounted with 2\u03bcL of 1:1 glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich, 114K0183V) in PBS on a microscope slide, and images taken from confocal microscopy (Leica LSM700) were analyzed to check exosome uptake.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and exosomes isolated previously were lysed in JS buffer (50\u00a0mM HEPES [pH 7.5] containing 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5\u00a0mM MgCl2, 5\u00a0mM EGTA, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (BioRad, Cod. 5000006, lot 64254929) using BSA as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, Bio-Rad, Cod. 1610158, lot 64269544). First, gels were electroblotted into nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare Life Science, catalog 10600002). Then membranes were blocked for 1\u00a0h with 5% blotting-grade blocker (Bio-Rad, 1706404) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad, 1706435) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, P1379-1L) and finally incubated at 4\u00b0C O/N with the primary antibodies. Signal detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan Italy). Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-FAP (Abcam, ab53066, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, MA, USA; sc-53564, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-MCT4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-376140, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, A5441, 1:15,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-FAK(Y576/577) (Cell Signaling Technology, 3281, 1:500 in 5% TBS-BSA), anti-FAK (Cell Signaling Technology, 71433, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-15363, 1:500 in TBS-milk), anti-TAPA1 (Abcam, ab35026, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Tsg101 (Abcam, ab83, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-32239, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-Calnexin (Abcam, ab10286, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti MMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:250 in 5% TBS-milk), MMP3 (Santa Cruz\u00a0Biotechnology, sc-21731, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b15 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:500 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-ITG \u03b21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-13547, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology, 9272, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9271, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-milk); anti-\u03b2-Catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc, #9582 1:1000 in 5% TBS-BSA), and anti-phospho-\u03b2-Catenin (Ser33/37/Thr41) (Cell Signaling Technology, 9561, 1:1,000 in 5% TBS-BSA).RNA extraction and real-time PCRTotal RNA (miRNAs and mRNA) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Reverse transcription was performed starting from an equal volume of total RNA/sample (150\u2013300\u00a0ng) using the miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218161) for total miRNAs and SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen, catalog number 18080051) for mRNAs. Quantitative analysis of miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by real-time PCR using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (QIAGEN, catalog number 218075) and miScript Primer Assays (QIAGEN, catalog number 3406126). The reaction for detection of miRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 70\u00b0C for 30 s. For mRNA amplification of FAP, Caveolin-1, SLC16A3, SLC2A1, and \u03b2-actin as the internal normalizer gene, we performed real-time PCR with iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, catalog number 1725124) and custom-made primers for mRNAs (Integrated DNA Technologies, Milan, Italy). The reaction for detection of mRNAs was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. All reactions were run in triplicate.Collagen contraction assayThe collagen contraction assay was performed with NFs in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) for exosome treatment and in 12-well plates (Corning, 3513) for combo miRNA transfection. Type 1 collagen (Corning, 354236, 33\u00a0ng/\u03bcL) was resuspended in an acidic environment composed of acetic acid (5\u00a0mM) and minimum essential Eagle\u2019s medium (Sigma, MO275, 10\u00d7). Then NaOH (1 M) was added drop by drop to restore the neutral pH for cell resuspension. For the contraction assay performed with combo miRNAs, NFs were first transfected with combo miRNAs (scrambled for control) for 48\u00a0h and then used for the contraction assay; for exosomes, NFs were first plated in the collagen plug and then treated with exosomes. In both cases, 1.5\u00a0\u00d7 10 NFs resuspended in 250\u00a0\u03bcL of FBS were added to type 1 the collagen mix prepared before. All steps during collagen handling must be performed on ice to avoid early collagen solidification. Then plates containing collagen plugs and cells were taken at 37\u00b0C with 5%CO2 for 3\u00a0h to allow collagen solidification. Subsequently, collagen plugs were detached from plate walls to allow cell contraction, and DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium (with or without exosomes, depending on the experiment) was added. Images of the entire collagen plugs were taken after 24\u00a0h with the camera tool of a mobile phone held in a fixed position. Then plug areas were calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed for NF contraction ability after exosome treatment or combo miR transfection.3D organotypic co-culture assayNFs were starved in DMEM-F12 medium without FBS for 24\u00a0h and then seeded in 35\u00a0\u00d7 10\u00a0mm cell culture dishes (Corning, 430165) in a neutralized matrix made of type 1 collagen treated with MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes (or PBS as a control) to ensure their activation (the same procedure as described under \u201cContraction assay\u201d). 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 MCF10A cells were seeded on top of the collagen plug for 48\u00a0h. Then the plugs were transferred to an invasion grid (screens for CD-1 size 40 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich) in a 60-mm plate, and complete growth medium was added underneath to create an air/liquid interface to trigger epithelial cell invasion. After 14\u00a0days, matrices were fixed, paraffin embedded, and cut into 10-\u03bcm sections. Organotypic matrices were stained with anti-pan-cytokeratin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8018, 1:400 in blocking solution) O/N at 4\u00b0C and then with the secondary antibody, Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Abcam, ab150116, 1:400 in blocking solution) for 1\u00a0h at RT in the dark. Images were taken with an inverted microscope and with a fluorescent one. Pan-cytokeratin-positive cells were counted using ImageJ software in different fields of the images to quantify the number of invading cells.Transwell migration assayThe migration assay was carried out with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable, 6.5-mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs pretreated with exosomes (40\u00a0\u03bcg) or transfected with miRNAs (as described under \u201cCell transfection and exosome treatment\u201d) were harvested with a trypsin-EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. T4D49, lot SLCH3365) and counted with a Neubauer chamber. Then 1\u00a0\u00d7 105 cells were washed with PBS to remove any FBS residue, resuspended in DMEM-F12 FBS-free medium, and seeded in the upper part of the Transwell chamber. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient needed for cell migration. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. Then the Transwell chambers were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells were scraped off the top of the chamber with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with the phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was calculated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Invasion assayThe in\u00a0vitro invasion assay was performed in Corning 24-well plates with 8.0\u00a0\u03bcm polycarbonate-membrane-permeable 6.5\u00a0mm Transwell inserts (Corning, Cod. 3422, lot 11619021). NFs (1.2\u00a0\u00d7 105). NFs transfected previously with combo miRs for 24\u00a0h were resuspended in a mix containing Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning, Cod. 354230, lot 6207017) diluted 1:5 in DMEM-F12, FBS free. The lower part of the chamber was filled with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, % antibiotic-antimycotics, and 1% amphotericin B to create the chemical gradient for cell movement. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 72 h. The Transwell supports were stained and fixed with 0.1% crystal violet in 25% methanol for 20\u00a0min at RT in the dark. The reaction was stopped with water, and non-migrated cells together with residual Matrigel solution were scraped off the top of the Transwell with a cotton swab. Representative images were taken with a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI3000 B). The percentage of migrated cells was evaluated by eluting crystal violet with 600\u00a0\u03bcL of 1% SDS for each well and measuring the respective absorbance at 490\u00a0nm with a Multiskan FC plate reader (Thermo Scientific).Scratch assayNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 104) were seeded in a 12-well plate (Corning, 3513) and, on the following day, transfected with miR-185-5p, miR-652-5p, miR-1246, or a scrambled sequence as a control. After 48 h, cells were starved for 3\u00a0h in DMEM-F12 FBS-free culture medium. Next, a scratched wound was made with a 200-\u03bcL tip in each well, and then cells were grown continuously in DMEM-F12 culture medium complemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/A for 24 h. Microscopy images were taken in different fields of the wound at the scratch moment (t0) and after 24\u00a0h (t24) using a 5\u00d7 objective of an inverted microscope (DMI3000 B, Leica, Milan, Italy). Scratch area was calculated with ImageJ software and analyzed to measure the wound-healing ability of NFs after combo miR transfection.Small RNA sequencingNFs (5\u00a0\u00d7 105) were plated in 100-mm dishes with DMEM-F12 culture medium supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (SBI) and 1% A/A and treated with 120\u00a0\u03bcg of MDA-MB-231-derived exosomes and the same volume of PBS solution as a control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, 15596018). Samples were shipped to Genomix4Life (Baronissi, Salerno, Italy), who performed small RNA sequencing using Illumina HiSeq2500 (SmallRNA 1\u00a0\u00d7 20M Cod. G4L1630 \u2013 iMir, Cod. G4L15055) and bioinformatics analysis (PCA component and differential expression analysis). Two biological replicates for each\u00a0experimental point were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, p\u00a0< 0.05 alone was considered for experimental significance; no p\u00a0value adjustment was performed because of the small sample size (NFs from pt. #1).In\u00a0vitro cell viability assayCell viability was evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. After 30\u00a0min of incubation, the plates were analyzed on a multilabel counter (Bio-Rad) to measure the absorbance values used for the analysis.Data availabilityThe RNA sequencing data discussed in this publication have been deposited in database: NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et\u00a0al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE185654 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185654).ReferencesTriple-negative breast cancer: clinical features and patterns of recurrenceUnravelling subclonal heterogeneity and aggressive disease states in TNBC through single-cell RNA-seqHallmarks of cancer: the next generationThe tumor microenvironment at a glanceStromal fibroblasts present in invasive human breast carcinomas promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through elevated SDF-1/CXCL12 secretionOxidative stress promotes myofibroblast differentiation and tumour spreadingCancer-associated fibroblasts modulate growth factor signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling to regulate tumor metastasisBreast cancer tumor stroma: cellular components, phenotypic heterogeneity, intercellular communication, prognostic implications and therapeutic opportunitiesA framework for advancing our understanding of cancer-associated fibroblastsIntegrins as biomechanical sensors of the microenvironmentA chemical biology screen reveals a role for Rab21-mediated control of actomyosin contractility in fibroblast-driven cancer invasionCancer-associated fibroblasts in desmoplastic tumors: emerging role of integrinsBiomechanical remodeling of the microenvironment by stromal caveolin-1 favors tumor invasion and metastasisTumor-derived exosomal components: the multifaceted roles and mechanisms in breast cancer metastasisIntercellular transfer of the oncogenic receptor EGFRvIII by microvesicles derived from tumour cellsGlioblastoma microvesicles transport RNA and proteins that promote tumour growth and provide diagnostic biomarkersExosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancerThe biology of exosomes in breast cancer progression: dissemination, immune Evasion and metastatic colonizationMicroRNAs in cancerMicroRNA dysregulation in cancer: diagnostics, monitoring and therapeutics.

        "title": "Wnt-5a-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 inhibits breast cancer cell migration in a CREB-dependent manner.",
        "content": "Tumor cell migration plays a central role in the process of cancer metastasis. We recently identified dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) as an antimigratory phosphoprotein in breast cancer cells. Here we link this effect of DARPP-32 to Wnt-5a signaling by demonstrating that recombinant Wnt-5a triggers cAMP elevation at the plasma membrane and Thr34-DARPP-32 phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells. In agreement, both protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of Frizzled-3 receptor or Galpha(s) expression abolished Wnt-5a-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Furthermore, Wnt-5a induced DARPP-32-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 cell migration. Phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 interacted with protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and potentiated the Wnt-5a-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, a well-known PP1 substrate, but had no effect on CREB phosphorylation by itself. Moreover, inhibition of the Wnt-5a/DARPP-32/CREB pathway, by expression of dominant negative CREB (DN-CREB), diminished the antimigratory effect of Wnt-5a-induced phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32. Phalloidin-staining revealed that that the presence of phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 in MCF-7 cells results in reduced filopodia formation. In accordance, the activity of the Rho GTPase Cdc42, known to be crucial for filopodia formation, was reduced in MCF-7 cells expressing phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32. The effects of DARPP-32 on cell migration and filopodia formation could be reversed in T47D breast cancer cells that were depleted of their endogenous DARPP-32 by siRNA targeting. Consequently, Wnt-5a activates a Frizzled-3/Galpha(s)/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway that triggers a DARPP-32- and CREB-dependent antimigratory response in breast cancer cells, representing a novel mechanism whereby Wnt-5a can inhibit breast cancer cell migration.",

        "title": "Paracrine Wnt signaling both promotes and inhibits human breast tumor growth.",
        "content": "Wnt signaling in mouse mammary development and tumorigenesis has been heavily studied and characterized, but its role in human breast cancer remains elusive. Although Wnt inhibitors are in early clinical development, it is unclear whether they will be of therapeutic benefit to breast cancer patients, and subsequently, to which ones. To address this, we generated a panel of Wnt reporting human breast cancer cell lines and identified a previously unrecognized enrichment for the ability to respond to Wnt in the basal B or claudin-low subtype, which has a poor prognosis and no available targeted therapies. By co-injecting Wnt3A expressing human mammary fibroblasts with human breast cancer cell lines into mouse mammary fat pads, we showed that elevated paracrine Wnt signaling was correlated with accelerated tumor growth. Using this heterotypic system and a dual lentiviral reporter system that enables simultaneous real-time measurement of both Wnt-responsive cells and bulk tumor cells, we analyzed the outcome of elevated Wnt signaling in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Interestingly, the PDX models exhibited responses not observed in the cell lines analyzed. Exogenous WNT3A promoted tumor growth in one human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing PDX line but inhibited growth in a second PDX line obtained from a patient with triple-negative breast cancer. Tumor suppression was associated with squamous differentiation in the latter. Thus, our work suggests that paracrine Wnt signaling can either fuel or repress the growth of human breast cancers depending on yet to be determined aspects of the molecular pathways they express.",

        "title": "Adipose tissue-derived stem cells differentiate into carcinoma-associated fibroblast-like cells under the influence of tumor-derived factors.",
        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g., expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Taken together, these data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g., expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Taken together, these data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion. "

This pathway may present therapeutic opportunities to inhibit CAF-induced cancer progression.BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide among women, and nearly 2.3 million females are newly diagnosed annually. Although there are initial responses to treatment, many cancers relapse and distant metastases occur in nearly one-third of woman; these are typically fatal. The biology behind BC metastases still remains undetermined. Therefore, understanding molecular determinants of metastasis is crucial for finding new therapeutic strategies. The tumour microenvironment consists of immune cells, blood vessels, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and extracellular matrix. This microenvironment plays key roles in disease outcome by inducing tumour cell proliferation and aggressiveness. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), an activated form of tissue-resident fibroblasts present within breast cancers, comprise a major component of the tumour microenvironment, characterised most commonly by expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin. CAFs can induce cancer progression and metastasis by secreting various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors (e.g., VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12, IL6 and IL8) and by modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) that facilitates tumour cell migration and invasion. CAFs also modulate immune cell function to create an immune-suppressive environment during cancer progression. The process of transformation of CAFs from resident normal fibroblasts is achieved by several growth factors, however, the mechanisms of transformation have not yet been fully explored and may represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention; interestingly, once transformed into CAFs, the CAF phenotype has been regarded as stable, probably though maintenance of epigenetic changes.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3\u2032untranslated regions (3\u2032UTRs) of target genes, leading to post-transcriptional downregulation. MiRNAs can be oncogenic or act as tumour suppressors, depending upon the specific genes that they regulate. Dysregulation of miRNAs within the fibroblast component of breast cancer has been reported, and is therefore implicated in induction or maintenance of the CAF phenotype. For example, differential expression between breast CAFs and normal fibroblasts has been reported for many miRNAs, including miR-221, miR-31, miR-205, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-107, miR-30b, the let-7 family and miR-26b, although there is relatively little consistency between reports. Far fewer miRNAs have been shown experimentally to have functional impacts on the breast CAF phenotype, or most interestingly indirectly on cancer cell behaviour; examples include miR-26b, let-7b, miR-200 family and miR-29b. Although some of these studies have indicated functional roles for specific miRNAs within CAFs, very few studies have directly investigated miRNA roles on the transformation and maintenance of CAF phenotypes and on how this impacts on cancer behaviour, therefore how miRNAs in CAFs are involved in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Here, we have focussed on miR-222 as a candidate regulator of CAF phenotypes and cancer behaviour. MiR-222 has previously been reported as an oncogenic miRNA in various cancers, including BC, functioning within the cancer cells themselves, as opposed to stromal cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that upregulation of miR-222 induced growth of cancer cells by targeting p27/kip1, as well as chemoresistance by targeting PTEN/Akt. Interestingly, in the context of our study on function in fibroblasts, levels of miR-222 positively correlated with fibroblast viability in hypertrophic scar tissues, while miR-222 has been shown to induce replicative senescence in human lung fibroblasts. However, to date, no studies have been published on roles of miR-222 in CAFs. Therefore, the above observations suggest the importance of miR-222 as a post-transcriptional modifier, playing functional roles in BC progression. However, it is unclear whether expression of miR-222 is only tumour cell specific or the other cells also express miR-222 in tumour microenvironment. As miR-222 is an important oncogenic factor in breast cancer, we wanted to unveil whether CAFs also expressed miR-222 to influence disease progression.Materials and methodsReagentsFoetal bovine serum (FBS), DMEM and antibiotic/antimycotic (100X; 10,000\u2009units/mL penicillin, 10,000\u2009\u00b5g/mL streptomycin, 25\u2009\u00b5g/mL amphotericin B) were purchased from ThermoFisher (MA, USA).

Fresh samples of surgically removed breast cancer samples were minced, digested with collagenase IV from HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd (Mumbai, India) and plated (collagenase I coated) to derive primary breast CAFs (from within tumour masses) and NFs (from\u2009>\u20091\u2009cm outside tumour margins). Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were obtained from the ATCC (VA, USA). The NF and CAF fibroblast lines were derived from breast cancer samples and immortalised using lentiviral transduction of hTERT, as previously described. All cell lines were cultured in the DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics in a humid atmosphere incubator with 5% CO2 at 37\u2009\u00b0C. NFs were transfected with scrambled siRNA negative control (NC), siLBR, miR-222 mimic or mimic control using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher; MA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. Similarly, CAFs were transfected with scramble negative control, miR-222 inhibitor, pCDNA or pCDNA-LBR. Seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting, qRT-PCR analyses, senescence studies or migration/invasion studies. To collect NF and CAF conditioned medium, cells were seeded into six-well plates at 1.5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells/well. As previously described, cells were transfected as appropriate for 24\u2009h, then medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. After 48 and 72\u2009h of incubation, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 150\u2009g for 5\u2009min, and then the supernatant was collected.RNA isolation and qPCRMiR-222 is upregulated in breast cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and controls breast fibroblast phenotype. a MiR-222 expression was determined by qPCR, and is shown for CAFs relative to NFs in three separate cell types.

Data represent biological triplicates. c Relative gene expression levels of the CAF markers, \u03b1-SMA, Fibroblast Specific Protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were assessed in immortalised CAFs as compared with immortalised NFs using qPCR. The data represent biological triplicates. d Relative expression levels of the same CAF markers were assessed using qPCR in NFs (left) or CAFs (right) transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC). The data represent biological triplicates. e NFs or CAFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC) and protein expression of the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA (ACTA2) and vimentin were assessed using Western blots, along with \u03b2-actin as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005For LMD samples, the total RNA was extracted from using RecoverAll Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit for FFPE (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols, or the mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). RNA was reverse-transcribed for miR-222 using the TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and the resulting first strand was amplified using specific Taqman miRNA assay primers (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). The PCRs were performed by StepOne plus detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and amplification data were normalised using RNU6 expression. Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2\u2013\u0394\u0394Ct method. For cultured primary fibroblasts (in Fig.\u00a01b), RNA was isolated from a 90-mm dish of cultured cells using TRIzol (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction and RNA quantified by MULTISCANGO (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). For miRNA expression status and gene expression status, first strand cDNA and cDNA were synthesised with miScript RT-II kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Superscript III (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), respectively. MiR-222 expression was analysed using PCR starter kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); U6 was used as an endogenous control. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) on StepOne detection system (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Expression was normalised to the house-keeping gene 18S.Protein extraction and western blotsCells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer System (lysis buffer pH 7.4, 200\u2009mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail,\u00a0100\u2009mM sodium orthovanadate) (Santa Cruz-sc24948). The lysates were centrifuged at 12700\u2009g for 20\u2009min at 4\u2009\u02daC. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). Total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) then transferred to the PVDF membranes (Millipore) and blocked with 5% skimmed milk. The membrane was then incubated overnight with primary antibodies. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies (Bangalore Genei, Bangalore, India). Bands were visualised using ECL.Histology, laser capture microdissection (LMD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)LMD was carried out on the Zeiss PALM Laser Capture Microdissection Microscope exactly as described previously. In brief, archival FFPE cancer blocks and matched normal blocks were obtained and sectioned at 10\u2009\u03bcm onto Membrane Slides NF 1.0 PEN (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). A guide section was stained with haematoxylin and eosin and reviewed by a histopathologist (LMW) to identify areas of fibroblasts with very few admixed inflammatory cells, epithelial cells or necrosis. The equivalent areas were then identified on other sections, and these were collected with the laser into lids of AdhesiveCap500 opaque PCR Tubes (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by laser pressure catapulting (LPC). The microscope settings used for LCM were cut energy 71, focus 65, LPC energy 100, focus 65 at \u00d7100 magnification. Areas dissected from each case varied between 5.2 and 27.4\u00d7106\u2009\u03bcm2 depending on fibroblast density. For IHC, FFPE human breast cancer resection tissue was available; cancerous and non-cancerous breast tissue were immunostained for \u03b1-SMA and LBR. The signal was amplified and visualised with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen, followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin.Luciferase reporter assaysLamin B Receptor (LBR) is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts and is downregulated in breast CAFs relative to matched NFs. a LBR was identified as a potential miR-222 target by bioinformatics. The potential miR-222-binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is shown (WT), along with a binding-dead mutant used experimentally (MUT). b Luciferase reporters were cloned that allow expression of luciferase transcripts containing the wild-type or mutant LBR miR-222 3\u2032UTR binding sites. These were transfected into NFs (left) or CAFs (right) along with either miR-222 mimic or control (NC), or miR-222 inhibitor (i) or control (NC), and relative luciferase activity was determined. The data represent two biological replicates. c, d NFs or CAFs were transfected as shown, and the relative expression of endogenous LBR was determined using qPCR (c) or western blots (d). qPCR data represent three biological replicates. e Representative matched pair of normal and breast cancer tissues was assessed for expression of LBR by immunohistochemistry (\u00d710 and \u00d720 magnification). Brown staining represents expression of the target protein, while pink is a counterstain. f Relative expression of LBR was assessed in eight pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour. The data represent technical triplicates. g Protein expression levels of LBR, and the CAF markers \u03b1-SMA and vimentin were assessed by western blotting in three pairs of primary cultured NFs and CAFs isolated from breast cancer patient-derived tumour samples. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05The potential miR-222 binding sequence from the LBR gene (WT LBR) and three nucleotide-mutated LBR (MUT LBR) (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned into pMiRGLO (Promega, WI, USA) under restriction sites PmeI and XbaI (primers listed in Table\u00a0S1). Luciferase activities were measured 48\u2009h after transfection using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assays (Promega, WI, USA).Cell proliferation assaysNFs and CAFs were seeded in 96-well plates at 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well and transfected the following day. Cell proliferation was monitored after 72\u2009h by MTT (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). In total, 10\u2009\u00b5l of MTT solution (10\u2009mg/ml) in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMEM media was added per well. After 4\u2009h of incubation, formazan complexes were dissolved in 100\u2009\u00b5l of DMSO, and signals were measured using MULTISCANGO plate reader (ThermoFisher, MA, USA). To evaluate the effects of conditioned media, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 were seeded in 96-well plates at 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well. Twenty-four hours after seeding, condition media was applied. MTT assays were performed at 48\u2009h as above.Cell migration and invasion assaysCell migration and invasion ability were determined by Corning transwell insert chambers (8-\u00b5m pores; Corning, MA, USA) and Matrigel (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) coated in a transwell chamber for invasion analysis. Conditional media from different treatment conditions were used in lower chambers for migration and invasion study. The cells were prior treated with conditional media for 48\u2009h. In total, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 were added into chambers and incubated for 28\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Cells that had migrated or invaded were fixed with 100% methanol, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, imaged and counted manually.Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) assaysSA-\u03b2-gal activity was detected by \u03b2-gal staining kit (Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells containing blue stain were counted manually as positive senescent cells, and images were taken under phase contrast.Cell immunostaining and confocal microscopyNFs and CAFs were allowed to attach to glass coverslips overnight at 37\u2009\u02daC. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (20\u2009min) and permeabilised with 0.1% Triton X-100 (15\u2009min). Blocking was performed with 5% BSA for 1\u2009h followed by incubation with \u03b1-SMA and vimentin primary antibodies (4\u2009\u02daC overnight). AlexaFluor 488-conjugated and TRITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1\u2009h. Coverslips were counterstained with DAPI and analysed on a confocal microscope (Olympus).CloningFor the LBR-overexpressing vector, LBR open-reading frame was cloned within pCDNA 3.1+ vector using KpnI and XbaI restriction sites and primers GTGGTACCACCATGCCAAGTAGGAAATTTG (forward) and GCTCTAGAGCTTAGTAGATGTATGGAAATATACGG (reverse).Statistical analysesAll data are representative of at least three independent experiments. The results are presented as means \u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments in all the figures. Differences were considered statistically significant at p\u2009<\u20090.05 using Student\u2019s t test.ResultsmiR-222 is upregulated in breast CAFs, and controls CAF phenotypesMany studies have shown that miRNAs are dysregulated in CAFs. To investigate roles of miR-222 dysregulation in CAF biology, we first assessed relative expression of miR-222 in 14 matched pairs of normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that have been isolated from breast cancer resection samples using laser microdissection (LMD). We found miR-222 to be upregulated in CAFs relative to matched NFs in 11 out of 14 cases, representing significant upregulation overall by a mean fold of 3.63 (p\u2009<\u20090.04; Fig.\u00a01a, left plot). To expand this finding, we further assessed miR-222 expression in four matched pairs of primary human breast NFs and CAFs cultures extracted from breast cancer resections; we found a greater than twofold induction of miR-222 in CAFs as compared with matched NFs in all cases (Fig.\u00a01a, middle plot). Finally, miR-222 expression in immortalised human breast NFs was compared with immortalised human breast CAFs; this also showed higher expression of miR-222 in CAFs by more than threefold (Fig.\u00a01a, right plot). We concluded that miR-222 is more highly expressed in CAFs than NFs in breast tissue.To explore functional roles of miR-222 in transformation of NFs to CAFs, we conducted a series of experiments on immortalised human breast NFs or immortalised human breast CAFs using miR-222 mimics to upregulate expression in NFs, or miR-222 inhibitors to downregulate expression in CAFs. First, miR-222 expression was assessed using qRT-PCR to confirm appropriate over- or under-expression (Fig.\u00a01b); miR-222 was significantly overexpressed by more than eightfold and was knocked down to one-third of its original level. Next, the relatively \u201cnormal\u201d or CAF-like phenotypes of these cell lines were characterised to establish their baselines for subsequent analyses. Expression of a range of classical CAF markers was assessed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a01c), immunofluorescence or western blotting (Fig.\u00a0S1). Relative expressions of ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin), FSP, CCL2 and VEGF were all substantially higher in CAFs as compared with NFs (a minimum of fivefold higher as assessed by qRT-PCR), as indicative of the CAF phenotype. Upregulation in CAFs of ACTA2/smooth muscle actin and vimentin was also confirmed at the protein level (Fig.\u00a0S1). Next, NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimics or control mimics, and CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or control inhibitors, and miR-222\u2032s influence on transformation of NFs to CAFs, or on maintenance of the CAF phenotype was examined using the same panel of CAF markers as previously. Transfection of miR-222 mimics in NFs resulted in significant upregulation of all the CAF markers (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, left plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). Furthermore, downregulation of miR-222 in CAFs using miR-222 inhibitors significantly downregulated expression of the CAF markers, with the notable and surprising exception of CCL2 (qRT-PCR, Fig.\u00a01d, right plot; western blots, Fig.\u00a01e). We concluded that miR-222 levels play key roles in controlling the CAF phenotype in breast fibroblasts.LBR is a direct target of miR-222To investigate potential mechanisms by which miR-222 plays roles in breast fibroblast biology, bioinformatics tools were used to predict potential target genes of miR-222. We analysed the best possible miR-222 seed matches using miRanda, TargetScan and miRDB software. Eleven predicted target genes were chosen for further analysis based on the target scores, containing seed matches for miR-222. On analysis of expression by qRT-PCR in NFs and paired CAFs from patient samples three of these genes, RECK, THOP1 and LBR, demonstrated differential expression in the predicted direction. LBR showed the most substantial and consistent dysregulated result in NFs and CAFs, and therefore LBR was prioritised for subsequent analyses. The potential miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR is depicted in Fig.\u00a02a. We performed a number of different assays to assess whether LBR is a true direct target of miR-222 within breast fibroblasts. First, luciferase reporter constructs containing either the wild-type miR-222 binding site from the LBR 3\u2032UTR or a mutated (non-binding) version of the site (Fig.\u00a02a) were cloned. Reporters were co-transfected with miR-222 mimics and inhibitors, or appropriate controls, in NFs and CAFs respectively, and luciferase assays were performed. MiR-222 mimics significantly inhibited the activity of the luciferase reporter containing the wild-type LBR site, while the mutated site was insensitive to miR-222 overexpression in NFs (Fig.\u00a02b, left plot), whereas miR-222 inhibitors significantly increased the activity of the wild-type reporter, while the mutated reporter was again insensitive in CAFs (Fig.\u00a02b, right plot). Next, endogenous LBR expression was assessed in NFs after transfection to overexpress miR-222, and in CAFs after transfection with miR-222 inhibitors (Fig.\u00a02c, d). LBR expression was downregulated by miR-222 overexpression and upregulated by miR-222 inhibition at the level of both transcript (Fig.\u00a02c) and protein (Fig.\u00a02d), findings that were in accordance with it being downstream of miR-222 function. We concluded that LBR is a direct target of miR-222 in breast fibroblasts, via a canonical miR-222 binding site within the LBR 3\u2032UTR.Downregulation of LBR induces a CAF-like phenotypeOur next aim was to determine whether LBR downregulation is involved in determining the breast CAF phenotype, since we have already determined that CAFs overexpress miR-222 and that this can downregulate LBR. In one approach, we examined whether breast normal stroma or tumour stroma exhibit differential expression of LBR using immunohistochemistry. LBR expression (Fig.\u00a02e) was relatively reduced in tumour stroma, in contrast to ACTA2 (smooth muscle actin) (Fig.\u00a0S2), which was relatively high in tumour stroma. In addition, qRT-PCR was performed on eight matched pairs of primary NF and CAF cultures. LBR expression was significantly reduced by a mean of 4.3-fold in CAFs compared with the NFs (p\u2009<\u20090.01), in contrast to expression of the CAF markers ACTA2 and vimentin, which were upregulated in CAFs as expected and indicative of the CAF phenotype (Fig.\u00a02f, g).LBR regulates the NF vs CAF breast fibroblast phenotype. a, b Immortalised breast NFs (left) or CAFs (right) were transfected with siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or control (NC), or plasmid to allow overexpression of LBR (LBR OE) or control plasmid (pCDNA), and LBR expression was assessed using qPCR (a) or western blots (b). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. c\u2013e Immortalised breast NFs (c, e) or CAFs (d, e) were transfected as shown, and the relative expression levels of the CAF marker genes \u03b1-SMA, fibroblast-specific protein (FSP), CCL2 and VEGF were determined by qPCR (c, d), or of \u03b1-SMA and vimentin by western blot (e). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005 and **p\u2009<\u20090.005We next assessed whether LBR downregulation was sufficient for transformation of NFs to CAFs, and conversely whether LBR overexpression would reduce CAF features. We transfected immortalised breast NFs with siRNA targeted against LBR or with an appropriate non-targeting control, and also transfected immortalised breast CAFs with plasmids to allow overexpression of LBR, or with appropriate control plasmids. The efficacy of knockdown and overexpression was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a) and western blots (Fig.\u00a03b); knockdown was to ~30% of the original levels, while overexpression was by more than ninefold. Next, we assessed expression of our panel of CAF markers in these cells after knockdown or overexpression of LBR using qRT-PCR or western blots as previously. Reduction of LBR expression in NFs, and increased expression of LBR in CAFs, significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the expression of all the CAF markers (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). We concluded that LBR is a key regulator of the breast CAF phenotype, and that knockdown of LBR alone is sufficient to transform NFs into cells that resemble CAFs.MiR-222 and LBR regulate migration, invasion and senescence in breast fibroblastsMiR-222 and its downstream target LBR modulate the behaviour of breast fibroblasts. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). a, b Migration (a) or invasion (b) of fibroblasts was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (a, b, upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (a, b, lower panels). c Expression of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase was also assessed by X-gal staining and is shown as blue green colouration (upper panels). Positive cells were quantified in data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). d Expression of the senescence markers MMP3 and osteopontin (OPN) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype markers IL6 and IL8 were assessed by qPCR in NFs (left plot) and CAFs (right plot). The data represent biological triplicates. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Since it has been previously demonstrated that CAFs are characterised by higher cell motility than their adjacent NFs, we also investigated whether miR-222 overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of LBR would induce increased NF migration or invasion, and conversely whether miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression would reduce CAF migration or invasion. Immortalised breast NFs or CAFs were transfected as previously with miR-222 mimics or inhibitors, respectively, or with siRNA targeted against LBR or overexpression of LBR, respectively. We then performed migration or invasion assays using transwell assays. NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siRNA targeting LBR had significantly higher migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, left plots), whereas inhibition of miR-222 or LBR overexpression in CAFs significantly reduced their migration and invasion capacity (Fig.\u00a04a, b, right plots). In order to confirm that these apparent effects on migration and invasion did not relate to differences in cell numbers induced by the transfections, we also evaluated proliferation capabilities of fibroblasts after these manipulations of miR-222 or LBR expression. We performed MTT assays after the same transfected conditions as mentioned above; there were no significant differences in proliferation of NFs or CAFs after any of these treatments (Fig.\u00a0S3). We concluded that miR-222 and its target LBR have key influences on aspects of CAF-like fibroblast behaviour, namely migration and invasion.It was previously reported that loss of LBR is associated with induction of cellular senescence, therefore, we also specifically evaluated senescence by determining senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activities in NFs and CAFs after dysregulation of expression of miR-222 or LBR. We found an increased SA-\u03b2-gal activity in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimics or siLBR compared to controls (Fig.\u00a04c, left plot). In addition, inhibition of miR-222 activity or increased LBR expression in CAFs significantly reduced SA-\u03b2-gal activity (Fig.\u00a04c, right plot). We also further examined features of this senescence phenotype by determining whether it was also associated with differential expression of other senescence markers. NFs and CAFs were transfected as before, and qRT-PCR was used to assess expression of MMP3, OPN, IL6 and IL8, which are upregulated in senescent cells particularly those showing the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Expression of all four markers was significantly upregulated in NFs transfected with miR-222 mimic or siLBR (Fig.\u00a04d, left plot), while expression was significantly downregulated in CAFs transfected with miR-222 inhibitors or to overexpress LBR (Fig.\u00a04d, right plot). This provided strong support that changes in \u03b2-gal activity we had detected were indeed associated with senescence, and that miR-222 and LBR expression impact on senescence phenotypes in breast fibroblasts.miR-222 and LBR in breast fibroblasts regulate proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cellsMiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to influence cancer cell proliferation and metastatic potential. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. a, b Proliferation of MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled was determined using MTT assay. The data represent biological triplicates. c\u2013f Migration (c, e) or invasion (d, f) of epithelial cancer cells was assessed using transwell assays. Representative images are shown (upper panels), along with quantified data that represent biological triplicates (lower panels). ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05To better understand the exact effects of miR-222 and its action on LBR in fibroblasts on epithelial breast cancer cell behaviour, we assessed abilities of NFs and CAFs after manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression to induce growth or migration/invasion of breast cancer cells. In particular, we focused on the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and the relatively less metastatic and triple-negative MDA-MB-157 cell lines. In order to assess influences of fibroblasts on the cancer cells, we decided to collect conditioned medium from fibroblasts and treat cancer cells with this. Fibroblast-conditioned medium has frequently been shown to influence cancer cell behaviour in this context. NFs or CAFs were transfected exactly as previously. Conditional medium (CM) was collected from these cells after transfection, and was added to cultures of epithelial breast cancer cells. First, proliferation of epithelial cells was assessed using MTT assays after treatment with CM (Fig.\u00a05a, b). In both epithelial cell lines, CM from control NFs caused a marginal, but not significant, reduction in proliferation, while CM from control CAFs caused a marked and significant increase in proliferation when compared with cells without CM (p\u2009<\u20090.005), as has been reported previously. More interestingly, overexpression of miR-222 in NFs and knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs significantly altered the activity of these CMs on both epithelial cell lines; miR-222 overexpression in NFs produced CM that had similar growth inducing effects to that from control CAFs, while knockdown of miR-222 in CAFs reduced this growth stimulation (Fig.\u00a05a). Changes in LBR expression within NFs and CAFs also had similar significant effects, with LBR knockdown allowing CM from NFs to induce relative growth increases, while overexpression of LBR in CAFs reduced the growth stimulatory effect of CAF CM (Fig.\u00a05b). We concluded that upregulation of miR-222 and downregulation of LBR were both necessary and sufficient for CAF function with respect to inducing proliferation of breast cancer cells. Next, we investigated the influences of these CMs on the motility of BC cells. BC cells also responded dramatically and significantly to these CMs in terms of migration and invasion capacities. CM from NFs had little influence on migration, while CM from CAFs significant and consistently induced migration (Fig.\u00a05c, e) and invasion (Fig.\u00a05d, f) in both epithelial cell lines. Overexpression of miR-222 or knockdown of LBR in NFs led to enhanced migration in the epithelial lines. Knockdown of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs led to reduced migration in the epithelial lines. Exactly the same result was evident in terms of invasion, with miR-222 and LBR having a key influence on abilities of NFs or CAFs to induce invasion in both epithelial cell lines (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013f). To further clarify that differences in migration/invasion of the breast cancer epithelial cells treated with CM did not solely relate to changes in proliferation rate, we additionally performed an experiment assessing proliferation in the cells treated exactly as for the migration/invasion assay (Fig.\u00a0S4), which involves an earlier time point than that used for Fig.\u00a05a, b. There were no significant differences in almost all combinations, supporting the conclusion that true differences in migration/invasion were seen. An exception is MDA-MB-157 cells treated with CAF CM, in which a significant reduction in proliferation was seen with CM after miR-222 knockdown and LBR overexpression; however, this change in proliferation was only up to 20% (Fig.\u00a0S4), whereas decreases in migration/invasion were up to 50% (Fig.\u00a05e, f), indicating that\u2014again\u2014true influences on migration/invasion were seen.MiR-222 and LBR control the ability of breast fibroblasts to activate EMT in breast cancer cells. Immortalised breast NFs were transfected with miR-222 mimic or siRNA targeting LBR (siLBR) or appropriate controls (NC), and immortalised breast CAFs were transfected with miR-222 inhibitor (i) or to overexpress LBR (LBR OE) or with appropriate controls (NC, pCDNA). Conditioned medium (CM) was collected from fibroblast cultures and used to treat breast epithelial cancer lines MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157. Expression levels of the EMT-associated genes slug and vimentin were assessed in MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cell lines cultured with the conditioned medium (CM) from the transfected fibroblasts as labelled using qPCR (a, c) or western blots (b, d). qPCR data represent biological triplicates, while \u03b2-actin represents a loading control for the western analysis. ***p\u2009<\u20090.0005, **p\u2009<\u20090.005, *p\u2009<\u20090.05Finally, to determine whether the fibroblasts were influencing migration and invasion capacity of epithelial cells by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathways, we analysed expression of EMT markers slug and vimentin in the BC cells after culture with the same CMs, using both qRT-PCR and western blots (Fig.\u00a06). CM from NFs had little influence on slug or vimentin expression at either transcript or protein level, while CM from CAFs induced up to a sixfold increase in expression. Manipulation of miR-222 or LBR expression in the fibroblasts consistently and significantly altered slug and vimentin expression in accordance with the changes in migration and invasion, with greater slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade more by miR-222 mimics or LBR siRNA in NFs, and reduced slug and vimentin expression in cells induced to migrate/invade less by miR-222 inhibition or LBR overexpression in CAFs. We concluded that miR-222 and, downstream of this, LBR have key influences on abilities of breast fibroblasts to control critical cancer-related behaviours of breast epithelial cancer cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT.DiscussionIncreasing evidence supports the proposal that miRNA dysregulation within CAFs modulates function of the tumour microenvironment. However, it is worth highlighting that most studies have emphasised investigation of miRNA roles within the tumour cells themselves, therefore it remains the case that relatively little is known about roles of miRNAs in the tumour microenvironment. In this study, we have focussed on roles of miR-222 within fibroblasts.We initially compared the miR-222 expression difference between CAFs and adjacent NFs in breast cancer tissue samples. Our study demonstrated that miR-222 was significantly upregulated in CAFs. Although others have made similar comparisons for multiple miRNAs in this context, miR-222 has not previously been identified as differentially expressed. This may be because studies have not always effectively purified only the fibroblasts for their analyses, as we have by LMD, or may be because miR-222 was not always included in the analyses. Next, we identified that miR-222 targets Lamin B receptor (LBR) expression in the CAFs. Various targets of miR-222 have been published previously, but LBR is a novel target on which we focused since we were able to confirm its downregulation in CAFs in accordance with negative regulation by the upregulated miR-222. Most importantly, downregulation of LBR with siRNA phenocopied miR-222 overexpression in functional experiments using breast fibroblasts, strongly suggesting that LBR is a key functionally important target of miR-222 in these cells.In terms of cellular function, we showed that miR-222 and LBR were both involved in defining and maintaining the breast CAF phenotype in terms of expression patterns, and fibroblast behaviours including migration and invasion. MiR-222 has previously been assigned roles in promotion of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and drug resistance within cancer cells, so our findings are in accordance with this, although they represent the first observations to our knowledge in a cancer stromal cell type. With respect to functions of LBR, a role in senescence has previously been reported in fibroblasts and we also observed a related result with manipulation of LBR expression by siRNA, overexpression or via miR-222 all impacting on senescence in breast fibroblasts. LBR encodes the lamin B receptor, a 70.4-kD protein of the inner nuclear membrane, which is known to interact with heterochromatin and B-type lamins. Other functions for the protein have been implied by observations that ectopic LBR expression deregulates differentiation of olfactory neurons inducing an un- or early-differentiated state.More excitingly, we showed that fibroblasts with differential expression of miR-222 or LBR have potent differential influences on behaviour of two independent breast epithelial cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that conditioned medium from fibroblasts that were stimulated to be more CAF-like by miR-222 overexpression or siLBR promoted breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Similarly, abilities of conditioned medium from CAFs to promote breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion was inhibited by reduced miR-222 levels or by LBR overexpression. Next, we investigated possible pathways involved in the breast tumour motility effects. We found that the enhanced migration and invasion were associated with increased expression of vimentin and slug in the BC cells, suggesting involvement of the EMT pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-222 upregulation, and subsequent LBR downregulation, within fibroblasts in the tumour microenvironment contribute to progression of BC, through induction of proliferation and EMT-related motility. It is established that cancer progression is not only dependent on tumour cells themselves but also dependent on the tumour microenvironment and, in particular, CAFs, which promote growth and invasion of cancer cells through synthesis and remodelling of ECM and secreting some growth factors. Hence, blocking CAF activity may be a key approach to effectively control cancer metastasis. Manipulation of either miR-222 expression or LBR function provide candidate approaches for development of these types of anti-cancer therapies. In particular, our data demonstrate that reduced expression of miR-222 or overexpression of LBR in CAFs greatly reduces their ability to promote aggressive behaviours in cancer cells, supporting the proposal that CAF phenotypes are not fixed and could be normalised therapeutically.Surprisingly, our data also implicate the miR-222/LBR axis in senescence induction in CAFs. Previous studies have indicated that increased miR-222 or loss of LBR induces senescence, so this is not a surprise in itself; however, it is unexpected that high levels of senescence in CAFs would be associated with cancer cell behaviours that promote progression, since senescence is often regarded as a tumour-suppressor mechanism in cancer cells. However, more recent evidence shows that senescent cells may promote oncogenesis through secretion of secretory factors (SASP) and several reports describe abilities of senescent human fibroblasts to promote growth and tumorigenesis. In support of this, here, we demonstrated that miR-222 overexpression in NFs induces a SASP phenotype, leading to increased secretion of at least the SASP factors IL6 and IL8, and the classical senescence marker MMP3.In conclusion, we present miR-222 and LBR as key molecules involved in transformation and maintenance of breast CAFs, which in turn therefore impacts on the aggressive tumorigenic behaviour of breast cancer cells. These molecules are novel targets for therapeutic intervention.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note: Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-019-0566-7.Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.Ethics approval and consent to participateEthical approval for collection and use of human tissue was obtained from the Leeds East Research Ethics Committee, references 06/Q1206/180 and 09/H1306/108, and also from the Ethical Committee, Medical College, Kolkata, references MC/KOL/IEC/NON-SPON/102/09-2015.FundingThe study has been funded by University Grants Commission (UGC), India [F.101-5/2014(IC)] and Royal Society, UK (Ref No. IE160146).

In vitro evidence suggests that the matricellular protein SPARC has a tumor\u2010promoting role\u2009in triple\u2010negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the clinical relevance of SPARC in triple\u2010negative breast cancer remains unclear.\u00a0Here, the authors analyzed the prognostic value of tumor and stromal SPARC in 148 patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. SPARC was most often expressed by myofibroblasts and inflammatory cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited a tumor\u2010promoting role in TNBC. Moreover, SPARC expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic marker of poor outcome. This study\u2009points to CAF\u2010derived SPARC as a potential novel therapeutic target in triple\u2010negative breast cancer. INTRODUCTIONTriple\u2010negative breast cancers (TNBC) are defined by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2 expression/amplification. TNBC represent 15% of all breast cancers. Despite surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, TNBC prognosis is poor, mainly due to the disease heterogeneity and lack of specific therapeutic targets. TNBC is characterized by its unique tumor microenvironment that differs from that of other breast cancer subtypes and promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and drug resistance, while inhibiting apoptosis and tumor immune suppression. TNBC microenvironment components, such as transformed extracellular matrix, soluble factors, immune cells and re\u2010programmed fibroblasts, hamper the host antitumor response and helps tumor progression and metastasis formation. In TNBC, stroma heterogeneity remains poorly understood, thus limiting the development of stromal cell\u2010targeted therapies.In the tumor microenvironment, heterogeneous populations of fibroblast\u2010like cells, collectively termed cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are key players in the multicellular, stroma\u2010dependent alterations that contribute to cancer initiation and progression. However, not all CAFs are tumor supportive. For instance, normal fibroblasts have been shown to suppress tumor formation. In breast cancer, CAF abundance has been associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas and predicts disease recurrence. In TNBC, recent single\u2010cell RNA sequencing (scRNA\u2010seq) studies highlighted a considerable CAF heterogeneity. The CAF subpopulations that contribute to immune suppression, inflammation and chemoresistance are now increasingly better characterized. In breast cancer, tumor\u2010associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory cells, and are typically M2\u2010polarized cells with suppressive capacity linked to their enzymatic activities and anti\u2010inflammatory cytokine production. TAMs support tumor progression and metastasis formation by blocking the anti\u2010tumor immunity and by secreting factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition. High M2\u2010polarized TAM levels are associated with poorer TNBC outcome. Tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) constitutes a robust and independent prognostic marker in TNBC treated with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. TILs are associated with improved disease\u2010free and overall survival (OS) rates in TNBC. Programmed cell death (PD\u20101) (a CD\u201028\u2010CTLA\u20104 family member) is an immune check\u2010point receptor expressed by immune cells that contributes to the immune tolerance of self\u2010antigens by peripheral T cells. PD\u2010L1 (one of its ligand) is expressed by immune cells, epithelial breast cancer cells and TILs. Activation of the PD\u20101\u2010PD\u2010L1 pathway specifically inhibits T\u2010cell activation, and is one of the mechanisms that allow cancer cells to escape the antitumor immune response. It is thought that TNBC are more immunogenic than other breast cancers. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in TNBC, PD\u2010L1 expression is more frequent (up to 60%) than in other breast cancers, and that PD\u2010L1 tumor expression is positively associated with stromal TILs. The matricellular protein Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin or basement membrane 40, BM40) is a Ca2+\u2010binding glycoprotein that regulates extracellular matrix assembly and deposition, growth factor signaling and cell\u2010stroma interactions. In cancer, SPARC is mainly secreted by neighboring stromal cells, and to a lower extent by tumor cells. SPARC plays oncogenic or tumor\u2010suppressive roles, depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, SPARC has been associated with worse prognosis and has pro\u2010tumor functions. In TNBC cells, SPARC stimulates their migration and invasion, and promotes MMP\u20102 activation, thereby contributing to the proteolytic cascades associated with tumor invasion. Moreover, SPARC stimulates tumor growth and lung colonization after grafting of mouse 4T1 and LM3 TNBC cells in syngeneic mice by promoting cell cycling and expansion of myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Conversely, SPARC transfection in high\u2010grade isogenic breast cancer cells reduces tumor rate, and favors epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition and the formation of a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment composed of immune cells, such as myeloid\u2010derived suppressor cells. Some in vitro studies in which SPARC was overexpressed or silenced in cancer cells showed its inhibitory effect on cancer cell motility, invasion and proliferation. In TNBC, mechanistic cell\u2010based studies support a tumor\u2010promoting role, suggesting that SPARC could be a candidate stromal therapeutic target.The aim of this study was to evaluate SPARC expression in tumor and stromal cells, their prognostic value, and correlation with fibrosis, TAM infiltration, TIL density, PD\u2010L1 and PD\u20101 levels in a large series of patients with non\u2010metastatic TNBC. The objective was to identify a TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis and eligible for stroma\u2010targeted therapy focused on extracellular matrix proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and reagentsThe rabbit polyclonal anti\u2010SPARC (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and the mouse monoclonal anti\u2010periostin (clone No 1A11A3) antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.

The rabbit monoclonal anti\u2010PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) was from Roche. The horse anti\u2010mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)\u2010horseradish peroxidase (#7076), and goat anti\u2010rabbit IgG\u2010HRP (#7074\u2009S) secondary antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. The donkey anti\u2010goat HRP conjugated antibody (FT\u20101I7890) was from Interchim. The Alexa Fluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG (#Ab150077) was purchased from Abcam, and the Alexa Fluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (711\u2010585\u2010152) from ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Hoechst 33342 (#FP\u2010BB1340) was from Interchim FluoProbes.Patients and tumor samplesTNBC tissue micro\u2010arrays (TMAs) included tissue samples from 148 patients with unifocal, unilateral, non\u2010metastatic TNBC who underwent surgery at Montpellier Cancer Institute between 2002 and 2012. All patients were informed before surgery that their surgical specimens may be used for research purposes. Patients did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. ER and PR negativity were defined as <10% expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and HER2 negativity was defined as IHC 0/1+ or 2+ and negative by fluorescent/chromogenic hybridization in situ. The study approval for patient\u2010derived xenografts (PDXs) was previously published. Construction of TNBC TMAs Tumor tissue blocks with enough material at gross inspection were selected from the Biological Resource Center. The presence of tumor tissue in sections was evaluated by a pathologist after hematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010saffron (HES) staining of few sections. Two representative tumor areas were identified on each slide from which two malignant cores (1\u2009mm in diameter) were extracted with a manual arraying instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer 1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA). After arraying completion, 4\u00a0\u03bcm sections were cut from the TMA blocks. One section was stained with HES and the others were used for IHC.TMA IHCTMA sections were incubated with antibodies against SPARC (clone AON\u20105031), cytokeratin 5/6 (clone 6D5/16 B4), EGFR (clone 31G7), PD\u20101 (clone MRQ\u201022), PD\u2010L1 (clone SP142) and CD163 (clone 10D6) on a Autostainer Link48 platform (Dako) using the EnVision FLEX system (Dako) for signal amplification and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogen. TMA sections were analyzed independently by two trained observers both blinded to the clinicopathological characteristics and patient outcomes. In case of disagreement, sections were revised by a third observer to reach a consensus. Results from duplicate cores, when available, were averaged. Basal\u2010like phenotype was defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and/or EGFR expression (>10% of tumor cells). SPARC signal in cancer cells was scored as negative (<1% of stained cells), or positive (\u2265\u20091% of stained cells). SPARC signal in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was scored as negative (<50% of stained cells), or positive (\u226550% of stained cells). SPARC signal in normal epithelial breast tissue samples (N) was compared with the paired tumor sample (T) and scored as lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), equal (=), or higher (N\u2009\u2265\u2009T). TIL density (peritumoral and intratumoral) was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no TILs), 1 (rare TILs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TILs than tumor cells) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TILs than tumor cells). Fibrosis was evaluated on HE\u2010stained sections, and was scored as: 0 (no CAF), >20%, 20%\u201050%, >50% of fibrosis. PD\u20101 expression by TILs was scored as follows: not evaluable (no TILs), 0 (no stained TIL), 1 (<10% of stained TILs), 2 (10\u201050% of stained TILs) and 3 (>50% of stained TILs). PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells was considered positive if detected in \u22651% of cells. TAM density was scored in CD163\u2010stained sections and compared with the TIL density: 0 (no TAM), 1 (rare TAMs), 2 (moderate infiltrate, fewer TAMs than TILs) and 3 (diffuse infiltrate, more TAMs than TILs).Immunofluorescence analysisParaffin\u2010embedded PDX tissue sections were deparaffined, rehydrated, rinsed and saturated in PBS with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Sections were incubated with 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010SPARC rabbit polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti\u2010periostin mouse monoclonal antibody (1A11A3), followed by incubation with AlexaFluor 488\u2010conjugated anti\u2010rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 594\u2010conjugated anti\u2010mouse IgG (1/400), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Hoechst 33342. Sections were imaged with a 63\u00d7 Plan\u2010Apochromat objective on z stacks with a Zeiss Axio Imager light microscope equipped with Apotome to eliminate out\u2010of\u2010focus fluorescence. TNBC cytosols, cell lines, conditioned medium and western blottingTNBC cytosols were previously prepared and frozen. The MDA\u2010MB\u2010453 (RRID:CVCL_0418), MDA\u2010MB\u2010436 (RRID:CVCL_0623), MDA\u2010MB\u2010468 (RRID:CVCL_0419), Hs578T (RRID:CVCL_0332), BT\u2010549 (RRID:CVCL_1092) and HCC1806 (RRID:CVCL_1258) TNBC cell lines were obtained from SIRIC Montpellier Cancer. The SUM159 (RRID:CVCL_5423) TNBC cell line was from Asterand (Bioscience, UK). The MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 (RRID:CVCL_0062), TNBC cell line was previously described. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were provided by J. Loncarek and J. Piette (CRCL Val d'Aurelle\u2010Paul Lamarque, Montpellier, France), THP1 (RRID:CVCL_0006) monocytes by L. Gros (IRCM, Montpellier), and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by M. Villalba (IRMB, Montpellier). Cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS (EuroBio), except the SUM159 cell line (RPMI with 10% FCS) and the THP1 cell line (RPMI with 10% decomplemented FCS, 10\u2009mM HEPES, 1\u2009mM sodium pyruvate and 50\u2009\u03bcM \u03b2\u2010mercaptoethanol). THP1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate (100\u2009ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) for 48\u2009h. Then, cells became adherent and the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with interleukin\u20104 (20\u2009ng/ml) for 24\u2009h to induce differentiation of M0 macrophages to M2\u2010polarized macrophages. The M2\u2010polarized THP1 phenotype was validated by analyzing CD206 expression by RT\u2010qPCR (Supplementary Materials and Methods). All experiments were performed with mycoplasma\u2010free cells. All cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat profiling within the last 3\u2009years of their use. For western blotting experiments, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5], 150\u2009mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X\u2010100, 1.5\u2009mM MgCl2, 1\u2009mM EGTA) containing cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Switzerland), and centrifuged at 13000\u00d7g for 10\u00a0min. The corresponding conditioned media were centrifuged at 500\u00d7g for 5\u00a0min. Proteins from whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg) or cell lysates (30\u2009\u03bcg) and conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) and anti\u2010tubulin antibodies using standard techniques. To prepare conditioned medium, HMFs were grown to 90% confluence in DMEM complemented with 10% FCS. Following washes with phenol red\u2010 and serum\u2010free medium to remove serum proteins, cells were incubated in DMEM buffered with 50\u2009mM HEPES [pH\u00a07.5] and without FCS for 24\u2009h. Medium was harvested, and centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min, followed or not by SPARC depletion. Briefly, HMF conditioned medium was incubated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg of monoclonal anti\u2010human SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031, sc\u201073\u2009472) overnight, and pre\u2010absorbed to protein G\u2010agarose at 4\u00b0C. Then conditioned medium (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was filtered using 0.22\u2009\u03bcm filters to eliminate cell debris. Cleared HMF conditioned medium (HFM CM) was collected and added to MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells for in vitro functional assays. SPARC immunodepletion was confirmed by western blotting. ScRNA\u2010seq data meta\u2010analysisTo evaluate SPARC expression in different cell subtypes, previously published scRNA\u2010seq data were used. The first study included five patients with TNBC, the second included six patients with TNBC, and the third included eight patients with luminal and TNBC tumors. Aligned 10\u00d7 Genomics (Pleasanton, CA, USA) NGS data, obtained from the public archives (European Nucleotide Archive accession code PRJEB35405, Gene Expression Omnibus database accession code GSE118390 and European Genome\u2010Phenome Archive accession number AS00001004031), were loaded in R (4.0) and processed using the Seurat 3.4 package and default parameters. Individual cell populations were annotated as published in the original scRNA\u2010seq study with minor modifications when appropriate. To take into account CAF heterogeneity in the study by Karaayvaz et al, the clearly different CAF populations, which were merged in this previous analysis, were named CAF\u2010A, CAF\u2010B and CAF\u2010C.Cell adhesion, migration and invasion assaysMDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell adhesion was assessed as previously described. Briefly, 96\u2010well plates were coated with fibronectin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml; sc\u201029\u2009011; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4\u00b0C overnight, and saturated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were detached with HyQTase (HyClone), washed in DMEM without FCS, and 5 10 cells were then plated and incubated in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2009min. Non\u2010adherent cells were removed by flotation on a dense Percoll solution containing 3.33% NaCl (1.10\u00a0g/L), and adherent cells were fixed (10% [vol/vol] glutaraldehyde) using the buoyancy method. Cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and absorbance was measured at 570\u2009nm. For migration and invasion assays, 8\u2010\u03bcm pore Transwell inserts (polyvinyl pyrrolidone\u2010free polycarbonate filters) in 24\u2010well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml fibronectin (500\u2009ng) (migration assays) or Matrigel (100\u2009\u03bcg, Corning) (invasion assays) at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009h. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were plated (5\u00a0\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well) in serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) on the coated insert in the upper chamber. In these different assays, DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS was used as chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. After 16\u2009h, non\u2010migrating/non\u2010invading cells on the apical side of each insert were scraped off with a cotton swab, and migration and invasion were analyzed with two methods: (1) migrating/invading cells were fixed in methanol, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30\u2009min, rinsed in water, and imaged with an optical microscope. Two images of the pre\u2010set field per insert were captured (\u00d7100); (2) migrating/invading cells were incubated with 3\u2010(4,5\u2010dimethylthiazol\u20102\u2010yl)\u20102,5\u2010diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 5\u00a0mg/ml, 1/10 volume; Sigma\u2010Aldrich) added to the culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. Then, the culture medium/MTT solution was removed and centrifuged at 10000\u2009rpm for 5\u00a0min. After centrifugation, cell pellets were suspended in DMSO. Concomitantly, 300\u2009\u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and thoroughly mixed for 5\u00a0min. The optical density values of stained cells (cell pellet and corresponding well) were measured using a microplate reader at 570\u2009nm.Wound healing assay by live cell imagingBefore each experiment, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were grown to confluence in 96\u2010well plates in a standard CO2 incubator. The 96\u2010pin IncuCyte WoundMaker was used to simultaneously create precise and reproducible wounds by gently removing cells from the confluent monolayer. After washing, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added, plates were placed in the IncuCyte device and cell monolayers were scanned every hour. Wound width, wound confluence and relative wound density were calculated using user\u2010informed algorithms that are part of the IncuCyte software package. These algorithms identify the wound region and provide visual representations of the segmentation parameters.Tumor spheroidsTo generate tumor spheroids, 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells/well were seeded in 150\u2009\u03bcl complete medium in ultra\u2010low attachment 96\u2010well plates (Corning 96\u2010well Clear Round Bottom Ultra\u2010Low Attachment Microplate, NY). Plates were centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 10\u2009min, and 3\u2009days later each spheroid was embedded in collagen gel that included 1\u00d7 DMEM, penicillin and streptomycin, 2% of SPARC\u2010immunodepleted FCS, 3.75\u2009g/L sodium bicarbonate, 20\u2009mM Hepes, 1\u00a0mg/ml rat collagen I and 1.5\u2009mM NaOH (qsp 150\u2009\u03bcl/well in H2O). After 30\u2009min at 37\u00b0C, serum\u2010free HMF CM (SPARC\u2010immunodepleted or not) was added on the spheroid\u2010containing polymerized collagen gel. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion area was analyzed in representative images with ImageJ.Statistical analysesContinuous variables were reported using medians and range and compared using the Kruskal\u2010Wallis test. Categorical variables were reported as numbers of observations and frequencies, and compared using the Pearson's chi\u2010square test or Fisher's exact test (if appropriate). All tests were two\u2010sided and P values <.05 were considered significant. Relapse\u2010free survival (RFS) and OS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2010Meier method and compared with the Log\u2010rank test. RFS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of the first recurrence at any site. OS was defined as the time between the date of the first histology analysis and the date of death from any cause. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models (the P value of the likelihood ratio test is reported). Hazard ratios (HR) are given with their 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed with the STATA 16.0 software (StatCorp, College Station, TX).RESULTSIn TNBC, SPARC is expressed in stromal and tumor cellsTo determine SPARC expression in TNBC (tumor and stroma), TMAs were generated using samples from 148 patients with TNBC (Table\u00a01). Their median age was 61.5\u2009years (range 30.2\u201098.6), and 68.2% of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Most TNBC (52.7%) were pT2, and 60.8% pN0. Moreover, 85.5% of tumors were ductal carcinomas, 6.9% lobular carcinomas, and 7.6% other histological types; 11% of tumors were classified as Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson histological grade 1\u20102. A basal\u2010like phenotype was observed in 61.9% of samples, and 66.9% of tumors expressed PD\u2010L1. In 51.7% of tumors, TAMs were more abundant than TILs, and\u2009>\u200920% of fibrosis was observed in 74.4% of tumors. SPARC expression (>50% of stained cells) in CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells and TILs was detected in 88.1%, 77.1%, 75.2% and 9.8% of TNBC samples, respectively (Figure\u00a01A, B and Table\u00a01). SPARC staining in tumor cells (>1% stained tumor cells) was observed in 42.4% of TNBC samples (Figure\u00a01A, Table\u00a01). In 80% of samples, SPARC expression was lower in the adjacent normal breast tissue than in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01A, C).Clinicopathological characteristics of the whole TNBC population and SPARC expression status in cancer and stromal cellsClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\tClinical and tumor characteristics\tWhole population (N\u00a0=\u00a0148)\t \t\t\tSPARC expression in TAMs\t\t \tAge (years), median [min\u2010max]\t61.5 [30.2\u201098.6]\tNegative\t27 (22.9%)\t \t<55\u2009years\t51 (34.5%)\tPositive\t91 (77.1%)\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t97 (65.5%)\tMissing\t30\t \tTumor size\t\tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\t\t \tT1\t52 (35.1%)\tNegative\t27 (24.8%)\t \tT2\t78 (52.7%)\tPositive\t82 (75.2%)\t \tT3/T4\t18 (12.2%)\tMissing\t39\t \tNodal status\t\tSPARC expression in TILs\t\t \tN\u2212\t90 (60.8%)\tNegative\t74 (90.2%)\t \tN+\t58 (39.2%)\tPositive\t8 (9.8%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t66\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\t\tTIL density\t\t \t1\u20102\t16 (11.0%)\t[0\u20101]\t42 (29.6%)\t \t3\t130 (89.0%)\t>1\t100 (70.4%)\t \tMissing\t2\tMissing\t6\t \tHistology\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\t\t \tDuctal\t124 (85.5%)\t<1%\t45 (33.1%)\t \tLobular\t10 (6.9%)\t\u22651%\t91 (66.9%)\t \tOther\t11 (7.6%)\tMissing\t12\t \tMissing\t3\t\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t\tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\t\t \tNo\t47 (31.8%)\t0\t20 (14.9%)\t \tYes\t101 (68.2%)\t[0\u201010]\t32 (23.9%)\t \t\t\t[10\u201050]\t40 (29.9%)\t \t\t\t\u2265\u200950\t42 (31.3%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t14\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\t\tPD1 expression in TILs\t\t \t\u226410%\t56 (38.1%)\t0\t18 (12.9%)\t \tBasal\t91 (61.9%)\t<10\t30 (21.3%)\t \tMissing\t1\t[10\u201050]\t74 (52.9%)\t \t\t\t\u226550\t18 (12.9%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t8\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\t\tFibrosis\t\t \tNegative\t76 (57.6%)\t0\t4 (3.0%)\t \tPositive\t56 (42.4%)\t<\u200920%\t31 (22.6%)\t \tMissing\t16\t20%\u201050%\t27 (19.7%)\t \t\t\t>50%\t75 (54.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t11\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\t\tTAMs (inflammation)\t\t \tNegative\t15 (11.9%)\t0/1\t25 (17.5%)\t \tPositive\t111 (88.1%)\t2\t44 (30.8%)\t \tMissing\t22\t3\t74 (51.7%)\t \t\t\tMissing\t5\t \tAbbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes.\u2010SPARC is a biomarker in TNBC and its expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC. (A) Representative images of TNBC tissue sections showing SPARC expression in cancer cells, CAFs, TAMs, endothelial cells, and in normal breast. SPARC expression was analyzed in a TNBC TMA (n\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples) by IHC using an antiSPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). (a) SPARC expression in tumor cells. (b) Absence of SPARC expression in the adjacent normal breast tissue (N). (c) SPARC expression in TAMs. (d) SPARC expression in endothelial cells. (e) SPARC expression in CAFs. (f) Absence of SPARC expression in CAFs. SPARC scoring in cancer cells: positive (>1% of stained cells), negative (<1% of stained cells). SPARC scoring in stromal cells: positive (>50% of stained cells), negative (<50% of stained cells). Magnification \u00d7200. Stars: tumor cells; arrows: SPARC staining. (B) Quantification of SPARC expression in TNBC stroma. Percentage of TNBC samples with positive SPARC signal (>50% of stained cells) in the indicated stromal cell types. N\u00a0=\u00a0148 samples. (C) Quantification of SPARC expression in normal breast. Percentage of normal breast tissue samples in which SPARC expression was lower (N\u2009<\u2009T), similar (=) or higher (N\u2009>\u2009T) than in the adjacent TNBC. T, tumor; N, normal breast; n\u00a0=\u00a050 samples. (D) Relapse\u2010free survival according to SPARC expression status in CAFs. Patients with TNBC were divided in two subgroups according to SPARC expression in CAFs: SPARC+ CAFs and SPARC\u2212 CAFs SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in patients with TNBC As SPARC was expressed in the tumor and stromal compartments, its prognostic value was then evaluated. The median follow\u2010up time was 5.4\u2009years (range [0.1\u201014.3]). Local or regional recurrence occurred in 10 (7%) patients, and metastases (alone or with loco\u2010regional recurrence) in 32 (22.5%) patients. RFS was not different in patients with SPARC\u2010positive (SPARC+) and SPARC\u2010negative (SPARC\u2212) tumor cells (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S1). Conversely, RFS was lower in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.09, 95% CI [0.70\u201037.18], P\u00a0=\u00a0.034) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a01D). Moreover, RFS tended to be better in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 TAMs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI [0.25\u20101.07], P\u00a0=\u00a0.088) (Table\u00a02 and Figure\u00a0S2). SPARC expression status in endothelial cells (Figure\u00a0S3) and TILs (Figure\u00a0S4) did not have any prognostic value (Table\u00a02). In univariate analysis, tumor size, nodal status, adjuvant chemotherapy and SPARC expression in CAFs were correlated with RFS (Table\u00a02). In multivariate analysis, only nodal status (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI [1.48\u20105.94], P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.35, 95% CI [0.18\u20100.68], P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and SPARC expression in CAFs (HR\u00a0=\u00a06.17, 95% CI [0.84\u201045.2], P\u00a0=\u00a0.015) were independent prognostic factors of RFS (Table\u00a02). During the follow\u2010up, 46 (31.1%) patients died among whom 11 (7.4%) without any TNBC recurrence. In univariate analysis, age (P\u00a0=\u00a0.027), tumor size (P\u2009<\u2009.001), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) were associated with OS (Table\u00a0S1). In multivariate analysis, only tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), nodal status (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P\u2009<\u2009.001) were independent prognostic factors of OS (Table\u00a0S1). Patients with SPARC+ CAFs (n\u00a0=\u00a0111, 88.1%) were younger (38.7% vs 6.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.018) and tended to have ductal tumors (88.0% vs 73.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.08) compared with patients with SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2). In addition, SPARC+ TAMs and SPARC+ endothelial cells were detected more frequently in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (80.6% vs 41.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.007, and 78.0% vs 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.026, respectively) (Table\u00a0S2). Fibrosis (>50%) was significantly less frequent in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (48.6% vs 80%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.028) (Table\u00a0S2). PD\u2010L1 expression (>50%) in TILs was more frequently detected in patients with SPARC+ than SPARC\u2212 CAFs (34.8% vs 15.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.049) (Table\u00a0S2). TIL density, PD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells and PD\u20101 expression in TILs were not significantly different between patients with SPARC+ and SPARC\u2212 CAFs (Table\u00a0S2).Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models to identify prognostic factors of recurrence\u2010free survival (RFS) in TNBCClinical and tumor characteristics\tUnivariate analysis\tMultivariate analysis\t \tHR 95% CI\tHR 95% CI\t \tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t \tAge\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \t<55\u2009years\t1\t\t \t\u226555\u2009years\t1.52 [0.77\u20103.03]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.214\t\t \tTumor size\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tT1\t1\t\t \tT2\t1.67 [0.74\u20103.75]\t\t \tT3/T4\t5.08 [2.07\u201012.47]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t\t \tNodal status\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tN\u2212\t1\t1\t \tN+\t2.77 [1.49\u20105.14]\t2.96 [1.48\u20105.94]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.001\t \tHistological grade (SBR)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0146\t\t \t1\u20102\t1\t\t \t3\t0.82 [0.36\u20101.85]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.645\t\t \tHistology\tN\u00a0=\u00a0145\t\t \tDuctal\t1\t\t \tLobular\t1.51 [0.59\u20103.86]\t\t \tOther\t0.77 [0.19\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.651\t\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\tN\u00a0=\u00a0148\t\t \tNo\t1\t1\t \tYes\t0.43 [0.24\u20100.78]\t0.35 [0.18\u20100.68]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.007\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.002\t \tBasal\u2010like phenotype\tN\u00a0=\u00a0147\t\t \tYes\t1\t\t \tNo\t1.55 [0.85\u20102.83]\t\t \t\tP \u00a0=\u00a0.152\t\t \tSPARC expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0132\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.84 [0.44\u20101.62]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.599\t\t \tSPARC expression in CAFs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0126\t\t \tNegative\t1\t1\t \tPositive\t5.09 [0.70\u201037.18]\t6.17 [0.84\u201045.2]\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.034\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.015\t \tSPARC expression in TAMs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0118\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.52 [0.25\u20131.07]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.088\t\t \tSPARC expression in endothelial cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0109\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.59 [0.29\u20101.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.165\t\t \tSPARC expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a082\t\t \tNegative\t1\t\t \tPositive\t0.81 [0.19\u20103.46]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.769\t\t \tTIL density\tN\u00a0=\u00a0142\t\t \t[0\u20101]\t1\t\t \t>1\t0.92 [0.48\u20101.77]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.807\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in tumor cells\tN\u00a0=\u00a0136\t\t \t<1%\t1\t\t \t\u22651%\t0.74 [0.39\u20101.40]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.360\t\t \tPD\u2010L1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0134\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t2.20 [0.66\u20107.40]\t\t \t\u226550\t2.12 [0.60\u20107.52]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.356\t\t \tPD1 expression in TILs\tN\u00a0=\u00a0140\t\t \t0\t1\t\t \t[0\u201050]\t1.28 [0.46\u20103.64]\t\t \t\u226550\t0.80 [0.20\u20103.21]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.593\t\t \tFibrosis\tN\u00a0=\u00a0137\t\t \t\u226450%\t1\t\t \t>50%\t0.98 [0.52\u20101.83]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.948\t\t \tTAMs (inflammation)\tN\u00a0=\u00a0143\t\t \t0/1\t1\t\t \t2\t1.97 [0.78\u20104.96]\t\t \t3\t1.14 [0.46\u20102.86]\t\t \t\tP\u00a0=\u00a0.180\t\t \t\nNote: p value in bold, statistically significant.Abbreviations: CAFs, cancer\u2010associated fibroblasts; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SBR, Scarff\u2010Bloom\u2010Richardson; TAMs, tumor\u2010associated macrophages; TILs, tumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytes. SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX and cell linesTo further validate SPARC expression in TNBC, its expression was assessed in the cytosols of 30 primary TNBC samples by western blot analysis. SPARC protein was detected in all cytosols and SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of samples (Figure\u00a02A). SPARC protein expression and localization were then examined in two TNBC PDXs (PDX B1995 and PDX B3977). SPARC was localized in stromal cells, including CAFs, in the extracellular matrix and in some tumor cells (Figure\u00a02B). Next, SPARC expression and secretion were analyzed in TNBC and stromal cell lines. SPARC was expressed and secreted by three of the eight TNBC cell lines tested (SUM159, Hs578T, BT\u2010549) that exhibit a basal\u2010like phenotype (Figure\u00a02C). SPARC was also expressed and secreted by HMFs, and to a lesser extent by HUVECs and M2\u2010polarized THP1 macrophages (Figure\u00a02D and Figure\u00a0S5).\u2010SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols, PDX, and cell lines. (A) SPARC expression in TNBC cytosols. SPARC expression was determined in 30 cytosols from primary TNBC samples. Whole cytosols (20\u2009\u03bcg proteins) were analyzed by 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031). A higher exposure of SPARC is shown. HSC70 (clone B\u20106) was used as loading control. (B) SPARC expression and localization in TNBC PDX. PDX B1995 and PDX B3977 sections were incubated with an antiSPARC polyclonal antibody (15274\u20101\u2010AP) (red). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue). Scale bar, 10\u00a0\u03bcm. (C) SPARC expression and secretion in TNBC cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated TNBC cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control. (D) SPARC expression and secretion in stromal cell lines. Whole cell extracts (30\u2009\u03bcg proteins) and serum\u2010free 24\u2009h conditioned media (40\u2009\u03bcl) from the indicated cell lines were separated on 13.5% SDS\u2010PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti\u2010SPARC (clone AON\u20105031) antibody. Tubulin was used as loading control SPARC is expressed in different CAF subsetsBased on the finding that SPARC expression in CAFs predicts RFS in TNBC, SPARC expression in different CAF subpopulations was thoroughly investigated through meta\u2010analysis of recently published scRNA\u2010seq data from patients with TNBC. In the first dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a05 patients with TNBC), the t\u2010distributed Stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) technique identified 20 different cell populations, including two fibroblastic cell populations, the first with features of myofibroblasts (myCAFs), and the second with an inflammatory phenotype (iCAFs) characterized by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules (Figure\u00a03A). The scRNA\u2010seq data analysis showed that SPARC mRNA was strongly expressed in myCAFs and iCAFs, as well as POSTN (the gene encoding periostin, a CAF\u2010secreted protein that promotes cancer progression and chemoresistance) (Figure\u00a03B). SPARC was also detected in perivascular endothelial cells, myoepithelial cells and basal cancer cells (Figure\u00a03B, Figure\u00a0S6), in accordance with our TMA analysis (Table\u00a01). In the second scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a06 patients with TNBC), high SPARC and POSTN mRNA levels were detected in three distinct CAF subtypes, in endothelial cells, M2\u2010polarized macrophages and cancer cells (where expression varied in function of the patient) (Figure\u00a0S7), consistent with our TMA data (Table\u00a01). As these two meta\u2010analysis indicated that SPARC was expressed in different CAF subtypes, another scRNA\u2010seq dataset (n\u00a0=\u00a08 patients with breast cancer) that identified different myCAF and iCAF clusters was analyzed. SPARC and POSTN mRNAs were detected mainly in myCAFs (ECM\u2010myCAF, TGF\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Wound\u2010myCAF, IFN\u03b1\u03b2\u2010myCAF, Acto\u2010myCAF clusters) and also in iCAFs (IFN\u03b3\u2010iCAF, IL\u2010iCAF, detox\u2010iCAF clusters) (Figure\u00a0S8). Altogether, this meta\u2010analysis highlighted that SPARC mRNA is expressed by different CAF subtypes, including myofibroblasts and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs involved in different tumor\u2010related processes, such as matrix remodeling, inflammation and resistance to therapy in TNBC. To complement the scRNA\u2010seq findings, the localization of SPARC and periostin was investigated in the TNBC PDX B1995 microenvironment. Co\u2010labeling with anti\u2010SPARC and anti\u2010periostin antibodies showed that SPARC (in green) partially co\u2010localized with periostin (in red) in CAFs at the cancer cell\u2010stromal interface (Figure\u00a0S9).Expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNAs in TNBC by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq data analysis. (A) Cell populations. Twenty cell populations were identified by analysis of the previously published single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq dataset PRJEB35405 that included five patients with TNBC, according to. (B) SPARC and POSTN mRNA expression. Relative expression of SPARC and POSTN mRNA in each of the 20 populations identified by single\u2010cell RNA\u2010seq analysis, according to. MyCAFs, myofibroblast\u2010like CAFs; iCAFs, inflammatory\u2010like CAFs; endothelial, endothelial cells; dPVL, differentiated perivascular\u2010like cells; imPVL, immature perivascular\u2010like cells; myoepithelial, myoepithelial cells; epithelial basal cycling, cancer cellsFibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC affects TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasionTo obtain some insights into the pathophysiological relevance of SPARC+ CAFs in TNBC, the effects on TNBC cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and invasiveness of SPARC\u2010secreting HMF CM were investigated (Figure\u00a0S10). The adhesion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells on fibronectin was reduced by 1.3\u2010fold (P\u2009<\u00a0.001) after incubation with HMF CM compared with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (Figure\u00a04A). Cell motility analysis in Boyden chambers showed that 88% of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells passed through the fibronectin\u2010coated filters after incubation with HMF CM (Figure\u00a04B). Motility was reduced by 2.3\u2010fold when cells were incubated with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04B; P\u2009<\u2009.01). Moreover, wound healing was significantly faster in MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells incubated with HMF CM than with SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM: wound closure was nearly complete after 16\u2009h in the presence of HMF CM (Figure\u00a04C). Lastly, MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion through Matrigel\u2010coated filters in Boyden chambers was 1.6\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04D; P\u2009<\u2009.05). The capacity of HMF\u2010secreted SPARC to enhance MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell invasion was confirmed in a tumor spheroid assay (Figure\u00a04E). MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroid invasiveness at day 3 was 3.4\u2010fold higher in the presence of HMF CM than SPARC\u2010immunodepleted CM (Figure\u00a04E; P\u2009<\u00a0.01). Thus, HMF\u2010secreted SPARC inhibits adhesion and promotes motility, wound healing and invasion of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 TNBC cells, highlighting its pro\u2010tumor role.Effects of fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC on TNBC cell adhesion, migration and invasion. (A) Cell adhesion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to adhere on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF conditioned medium (HMF CM) or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM\u2014SPARC) for 30\u2009min. Upper panels, representative images of adherent cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panel, adhesion was quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (B) Cell migration. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to migrate for 16\u2009h on a fibronectin matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). Upper panels, representative images of migrating cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, quantification of migrating MTT\u2010stained cells (absorbance was read at 570\u2009nm). Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (C) Cell migration induced by wound healing. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 sub\u2010confluent cell layers were wounded using the 96\u2010well IncuCyte scratch wound assay. Left panels, representative images of MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 wound healing over time (t\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0h, t\u00a0=\u00a016\u2009h) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC). In the left panels, the initial scratch wound is delimited by the dashed lines. Bars, 400\u2009\u03bcm. Right panel, wound healing (wound width, in \u03bcm) in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) was quantified over time. The data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in another independent experiment. (D) Cell invasion. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells were let to invade on a Matrigel matrix in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 16\u2009h. Upper panels, representative images of invading cells stained with crystal violet. Lower panels, invading cells were stained with MTT and quantified at 570\u2009nm. Data are the mean (% of seeded cells)\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a03); ***P\u2009<\u2009.001 (Student's t test). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. (E) Cell invasion in tumor spheroid assay. MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 tumor spheroids embedded in collagen I gel were let to invade in the presence of HMF CM or SPARC\u2010immunodepleted HMF CM (HMF CM \u2010 SPARC) for 3\u2009days. Left panels, representative images of invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cells. Right panel, the invading MDA\u2010MB\u2010231 cell area was quantified using Image J. Data are the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD (n\u00a0=\u00a05); **P\u2009<\u2009.01 (Student's t test).DISCUSSIONHere, we showed that in TNBC, SPARC is expressed in both tumor and stromal cells, and that its expression in CAFs independently predicts RFS in patients with TNBC. Previous studies reported that SPARC is overexpressed in TNBC compared with other breast cancer molecular subtypes. In our study using IHC, SPARC expression in tumor cells was detected in 42% of TNBC samples, in agreement with previous literature data (SPARC expression in 37 to 52% of TNBC). However, SPARC expression in TNBC has never been correlated with clinicopathological parameters, such as age, histopathologic grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Watkins et al reported that in breast cancer, SPARC is detected more frequently in ductal carcinomas. Similarly, we found that ductal carcinoma tended to be more frequent in patients with SPARC+ CAFs, and that patients with TNBC with SPARC+ CAFs were often younger. SPARC (mRNA or protein) overexpression prognostic value is controversial in TNBC. High SPARC expression in TNBC has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies, and with better prognosis in another. We recently showed that high SPARC mRNA expression (n\u00a0=\u00a0225 patients with TNBC) tends to be associated with shorter RFS using an on line survival tool. In our current TNBC population, SPARC expression by tumor cells was not associated with RFS or OS. Studies using IHC reported that SPARC expression in tumor cells was associated with prognosis. Here, we found that SPARC was mainly expressed by stromal cells, including CAFs, and that its expression in CAFs was an independent prognostic factor of poor RFS in TNBC. In patients with SPARC+ CAFs, TILs more frequently expressed PD\u2010L1, suggesting the interest to specifically evaluate the benefit of combining anti\u2010PD1 or \u2010PD\u2010L1 with anti\u2010SPARC targeted therapies in this TNBC subgroup. Moreover, fibrosis was less frequent in TNBC samples with SPARC+ CAFs, suggesting a better drug accessibility in this TNBC subgroup. Other studies reported a frequent SPARC stromal expression, but none, to our knowledge, evaluated its prognostic value or determined SPARC expression in the different stromal cell types.Here, we observed the presence of SPARC cleaved fragments in about 30% of TNBC cytosols. The anti\u2010SPARC antibody (clone AON\u20105031) used for IHC recognizes full\u2010length SPARC and also some SPARC N\u2010terminal fragments. Therefore, the prognostic value of SPARC expression in CAFs in TNBC described in the present study could be explained by the activity of the full\u2010length protein and also of some of its cleaved fragments. SPARC includes three different structural and functional modules: the N\u2010terminal acidic domain, the follistatin\u2010like domain and the C\u2010terminal extracellular Ca2+ binding domain. SPARC biological activity can be modulated by limited proteolysis, leading to the unmasking of distinct or amplified biological functions compared with those of the full\u2010length protein. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP\u20101, \u22122, \u22123, \u22129 and\u2009\u2212\u200913) cleave SPARC in vitro in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain, releasing fragments that have higher affinity for collagens and that modulate cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix extracellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, MMP\u20103\u2010mediated SPARC cleavage in vitro produces fragments that affect angiogenesis. Cleavage of SPARC extracellular Ca2+ binding domain by MMP\u20108 and MMP\u201013 has been detected in the serum of patients with lung cancer, suggesting their presence also in vivo. Similarly, cathepsin K cleaves SPARC in vitro and in vivo in its N\u2010terminal acid domain and in its extracellular Ca2+ binding domain in mice harboring prostate cancer bone metastases. We recently reported that secreted SPARC is cleaved by cathepsin D in TNBC, releasing a 9\u2010kDa SPARC fragment with enhanced oncogenic properties. The meta\u2010analysis of previously published scRNA\u2010seq datasets showed that SPARC is expressed by different CAF subsets in TNBC. CAFs are the most abundant stromal cells in many cancers, including TNBC, and they are a phenotypically heterogeneous population, generally described as having a myofibroblastic phenotype (ie, secretory and contractile cells that express \u03b1\u2010SMA). Recently, it was found that fibroblast heterogeneity occurs in breast cancers and in TNBC. Two myofibroblastic subsets (CAF\u2010S1 and CAF\u2010S4) differentially accumulate in TNBC. CAF\u2010S1 cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, whereas CAF\u2010S4 cells have pro\u2010metastatic function. More recently, a scRNA\u2010seq approach in breast cancer identified eight clusters within the immunosuppressive CAF\u2010S1 subset, subdivided in myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs. Another scRNA\u2010seq\u2010based study identified myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs with immunomodulatory properties in TNBC. By reanalyzing these scRNA\u2010seq datasets, we noticed that SPARC mRNA was expressed by different CAF subsets, especially myofibroblast\u2010like and inflammatory\u2010like CAFs, as well as POSTN, a gene encoding periostin, a protein that is secreted by CAFs with pro\u2010tumor activity in breast cancer. We then confirmed that SPARC and periostin (partially) co\u2010localize in CAFs within the TNBC PDX microenvironment. Future studies will determine whether SPARC participates in the homeostasis of these different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and whether SPARC has a different prognostic value when expressed in the different CAF subgroups in TNBC.In TNBC, CAFs regulate a number of tumor\u2010promoting processes, including motility and invasion, drug resistance, inflammation and immunosuppression. Our results showed that SPARC secreted by fibroblasts acts directly on TNBC cells by inhibiting their adhesion and promoting/facilitating their motility and invasiveness. It has been reported that SPARC regulates signaling pathways that influence epithelial\u2010to\u2010mesenchymal transition, cell adhesion, motility and invasiveness of cancer cells. Moreover, SPARC activation of the ERK and AKT downstream signaling pathways modulates cancer cell adhesion, motility and invasion. SPARC can bind directly to integrin receptors (\u03b1v\u03b21, \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25), resulting in activation of the intracellular kinase Akt, the focal adhesion kinase FAK and the integrin\u2010related kinase ILK. Future mechanistic studies should decipher the signaling pathways affected by CAF\u2010secreted SPARC in TNBC cells. All these findings suggest that SPARC may be a therapeutic target in TNBC. Drugs that target CAFs have emerged as an important option for improving cancer therapies, and targeting CAF\u2010derived extracellular matrix proteins has been proposed as an innovative anti\u2010stromal therapy. Our work strongly suggests that CAF\u2010derived SPARC also may be a promising candidate for anti\u2010stromal therapy.CONCLUSIONIn this series, almost 88.1% of TNBC harbored SPARC+ CAFs and displayed distinct clinicopathological characteristics. SPARC expression in CAFs independently predicted worse RFS. This biomarker could be useful to identify a specific TNBC subgroup with worse prognosis. Furthermore, SPARC was expressed by different CAF subpopulations in TNBC, and fibroblast\u2010secreted SPARC exhibited pro\u2010tumor functions. Our results could have therapeutic implications for future anti\u2010SPARC+ CAF targeted therapy.AbbreviationsBM40basement membrane 40BSAbovine serum albuminCAFscancer\u2010associated fibroblastsCath\u2010DCathepsin DCIconfidence intervalCMconditioned mediumdPVLdifferentiated perivascular\u2010like cellsECMextracellular matrixEGFRepithelial growth factor receptorERestrogen receptorFCSfetal calf serumHEShematoxylin\u2010eosin\u2010safraninHMFhuman mammary fibroblastHRhazard ratiosHUVECshuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsiCAFsinflammatory\u2010like CAFsIFNinterferonIHCimmunohistochemistryILinterleukinmyCAFsmyofibroblasts\u2010like CAFsOSoverall survivalPD\u20101programmed cell death 1PD\u2010L1programmed cell death ligand 1PDXpatient\u2010derived xenograftPRprogesterone receptorPVLimmature perivascular\u2010like cellsRFSrelapse\u2010free survivalscRNA\u2010seqsingle\u2010cell RNA sequencingSPARCsecreted protein acidic and rich in cysteineTAMstumor\u2010associated macrophagesTILstumor\u2010infiltrating lymphocytesTMAtissue microarrayTNBCtriple negative breast cancerTNFtumor necrosis factorstSNEt\u2010distributed stochastic neighbor embeddingAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSThe work reported in the paper has been performed by the authors, unless clearly specified in the text.

        "title": "Expression of Wnt5a is downregulated by extracellular matrix and mutated c-Ha-ras in the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A.",
        "content": "Wnt genes are involved in tumour growth and regulate cell adhesion. Some (Wnt5a and Wnt7b) are more highly expressed in human breast cancer compared to normal tissues. Wnt5a is involved in the regulation of cell movement in Xenopus and is upregulated in several human cancers. Factors regulating Wnt gene expression in human breast epithelium are poorly understood, but c-erbB2 is amplified in many breast cancers and associated with rapid growth and metastasis, as is high expression of c-Ha-ras. To further understand the regulation of Wnt gene expression, this study investigated the effect of proto-oncogenes c-Ha-ras and c-erbB2, and collagen on Wnt mRNA expression, in a normal spontaneously immortalised human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Out of nine human Wnt genes investigated, Wnt5a and Wnt7b were expressed in the parental cell line, and neomycin-, c-Ha-ras- and c-erbB2-transfected cell lines. The level of Wnt5a mRNA expression was decreased 40-fold and 3-fold when parental cells were grown on collagen and in collagen, respectively. This downregulation correlated with cell branching. However, Wnt7b was not regulated by collagen. In the presence of activated c-Ha-ras, the level of Wnt5a mRNA expression was markedly decreased (&gt; 200-fold) and cell growth rate was elevated. When treated with p21ras inhibitor, BZA-5B, there was a moderate reversal of Wnt5a mRNA expression (2-fold) with a parallel decrease in cell growth. The data indicate that c-Ha-ras is an upstream inhibitory regulator of Wnt5a, and provide further evidence of an inverse relationship between Wnt5a mRNA expression and cell branching. This demonstrates selectivity of regulation of individual members of the Wnt gene family by the ras pathway. Overexpression of c-erbB2 had no effect on Wnt5a or Wnt7b mRNA expression. Thus, extracellular matrix and ras regulate Wnt5a, providing a mechanism for feedback of morphogenetic movements, which is relevant also to cancer biology.",

        "full_text": "Estimation of Functional Fitness of Korean Older Adults Using Machine Learning Techniques: The National Fitness Award 2015\u20132019Measuring functional fitness (FF) to track the decline in physical abilities is important in order to maintain a healthy life in old age. This paper aims to develop an estimation model of FF variables, which represents strength, flexibility, and aerobic endurance, using easy-to-measure physical parameters for Korean older adults aged over 65 years old. The estimation models were developed using various machine learning techniques and were trained with the National Fitness Award datasets from 2015 to 2019 compiled by the Korea Sports Promotion Foundation. The machine-learning-based nonlinear regression models were employed to improve the performance of the previous linear regression models. To derive the optimal estimation model that showed the best estimation accuracy, we developed five different machine-learning-based estimation models and compares the estimation accuracy not only among the machine learning models, but also with the previous linear regression model. The coefficient of determination of the FF variables was used to compare the performance of each model; the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and standard error of estimation (SEE) were used to evaluate the model performance. The deep neural network (DNN) model presented the best performance among the regression models for the estimation of all of the FF variables. The coefficient of determination in the HGS test was 0.784, while those of the others were less than 0.5 meaning that the HGS of older adults can be reliably estimated using easy-to-measure independent variables.1. IntroductionThe number of elderly people older than 65 years of age has increased rapidly in recent decades, and has been a critical social issue in many countries. Human aging leads to the degradation of physical functionality, such as weakening of the muscle forces, and can cause serious diseases and impairments. The degradation of physical functionality is critically correlated with diseases that arise in old age. For example, the timed up-and-go (TUG) test results of elderly people show a correlation with their mental and physical health. Health-related quality of life is associated with physical functionality, and it is recommended that physical functionality is maintained in old age in order to ensure a healthy life without illness.Habitual physical activity and proper nutrition are the top priorities for delaying the loss of physical functionality. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that elderly individuals perform moderate-intensity aerobic exercises for at least 150\u2013300 min per week, vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise for at least 75\u2013150 min, or a combination of both. The WHO also recommends strength training for more than 2 days a week and multicomponent physical activities more than 3 days a week. Although regular physical activity is important to preserve a healthy life in old age, <40% of the elderly population exercise regularly in their daily life. Insufficient physical activity primarily causes functional disability and limited mobility, and these cascades result in more critical illnesses. Smart fitness services that provide personalized workout programs can be an effective solution to encourage the elderly population to exercise regularly. A personalized workout program that fits an individual\u2019s physical ability prevents over- or under-exercise and cramping during exercise. Estimation of physical fitness levels, including the muscle strength, flexibility, coordination, agility/dynamic balance, and aerobic endurance of elderly persons, is important to construct personalized workout programs, and functional fitness (FF) assessment tests have been used to evaluate individual physical fitness levels.However, performing the FF assessment and monitoring the physical abilities periodically in older adults are associated with many difficulties. In addition, measuring FF variables requires a sophisticated device and is costly. To address these inconveniences, several previous studies have proposed methods for estimating an individual\u2019s FF variables with simple physical parameters using multiple linear regression (MLR). Nevertheless, the MLR model has a critical limitation in that it can only represent the linear relationship between the inputs and outputs. In previous studies, machine-learning-based prediction models, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), have been used to consider nonlinear relations in FF prediction. Mahajan et al. reported that the RF model improved the estimation accuracy of 231 divers\u2019 physical fitness levels compared with the linear regression model. Akay et al. predicted the hamstring and quadriceps strength of athletes using an SVM estimation model. Zhu et al. used SVM to predict athletes\u2019 performance, Taha et al. estimated archers\u2019 physical fitness level using the k-nearest neighbors and SVM, and Matteo et al. proposed nearest neighbor models to predict athlete performance in team sports.Nevertheless, these nonlinear prediction models focused on being trained with individuals who have superior physical functionality, which is not the general population. Previous studies have measured athletes\u2019 physical information to train a prediction model with complicated equipment, which is not adequate for ordinary applications. Lee et al. presented an artificial neural network-based regression model for Korean adults aged <65 years. However, they did not consider older adults whose variables in the FF test were different. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning-based estimation model for FF variables with easy-to-measure physical variables in Korean older adults. To derive the optimal estimation model that shows the best estimation performance, we constructed various machine-learning-based estimation models and evaluated the estimation performance of each model.This study proposed the FF variable estimation model for evaluating the physical fitness level of elderly adults using easy-to-measure independent variables. The proposed model can be used as an effective tool to evaluate the personal fitness level in smart fitness services.Various nonlinear machine learning regression models were constructed and evaluated to compare the accuracy with the previous linear model and to derive the optimal estimation model presenting the best estimation performance.The main contributions of this study are as follows: 2. Materials and Methods2.1. Ethics StatementThe study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the International Review Board of Konkuk University (7001355-202101-E-132).2.2. DatasetThe National Fitness Award (NFA) is a program carried out by the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism (MCST) and the Korea Sports Promotion Foundation (KSPF) to measure the physical fitness levels of general Koreans aiming to help people live healthier. This paper employs the NFA datasets of elderly adults (age: \u226565 years), gathered by the KSPF to train the machine-learning-based estimation models. The NFA dataset includes the physical fitness levels of individuals that are measured under strict measurement protocols at 75 sites throughout the Republic of Korea. The participants of the NFA dataset, who were collected between 2015 and 2019, were older adults (total = 210,490) who were older than 65 years of age. We excluded missing values of older adults\u2019 independent variables and FF variables, resulting in 178,960 adults in the regression model datasets (men: n = 61,465, women: n = 117,495). The regression models in the study used independent variables (e.g., sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and percent body fat) as the inputs and predicted the FF variables, including hand grip strength (HGS), lower body strength (30 s chair stand test), lower body flexibility (chair sit-and-reach test), coordination (figure-of-eight walk test), agility/dynamic balance (TUG test), and aerobic endurance (2 min step test), as the outputs; 70% of the data (total: n = 125,272, men: n = 42,911, women: n = 82,281) were used as the training dataset, and 30% of the data (total: n = 53,688; men: n = 18,474; women: n = 35,214) were used as the validation dataset. A summary of the NFA datasets is presented in Table 1.Measurement of physical independent variables and FF variables: The measurements of independent variables and FF variables followed the NFA guidelines, as presented in a previous study.2.3. Data Pre-ProcessingPearson\u2019s correlation analysis was used to assess the linear relationship between the independent variables and FF variables. Table 2 shows the degree of correlation between the input and output variables. HGS had a positive linear correlation with height and weight and a negative correlation with sex and percent body fat. Figure-of-eight walk and TUG had a positive correlation with age, and the 30 s chair stand had a negative correlation with age. The chair sit-and-reach showed a positive correlation with sex and a negative correlation with height. As most of the FF variables showed a weak linear relation with the independent variables, it is possible to consider using nonlinear prediction models rather than linear prediction models to improve the prediction accuracy. Standardization: Standardization, which is a feature scaling technique, was used for the input variables to avoid data redundancy and dependency caused by feature scale differences (Equation (1)). All data, except sex, were centered around the mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1.  where \u00a0 denote the values of the input and standardized input, respectively.  and  are the average and standard deviation of the input variable , respectively. For standardization, sex was expressed as 1 (male) or 2 (female).Outlier removal: Outliers, which can distort statistical analyses and create prediction models of poor outcomes, are data with abnormal values from other data. To manage outliers in the training dataset, the studentized residual (SRE) was used, and outlier data were removed when the absolute value of the SRE was >2.Feature selection: Feature selection methods were used to increase the estimation performance and shorten the training regression model. The p-value was used to validate the relationship between the independent variables and FF variables. The independent variables with p-value is >0.05 were removed for dimension reduction and estimation accuracy improvement. In addition, feature selection using the Boruta algorithm was used to assess variables that could decrease the performance of the regression model and cause overfitting. In the ranking of the features, 1 means confirmed, 2 means tentative, and 3 means rejected. The p-values for each variable and the Boruta algorithm ranking are listed in Table 3. With reference to feature selection, we selected the input variables and maximized the estimation performance.2.4. Machine Learning-Based Estimation ModelsVarious machine-learning-based regression models were used to predict the FF variable with independent variables. Each model was evaluated using R2 and SEE values and was compared with the other models. A summary of this method is shown in Figure 1.2.4.1. Support Vector RegressionSVM, which predicts the optimal hyperplane generated in an n-dimensional feature space, is a supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression. SVR is specifically used for regression, and Equation (2) represents the linear approximation function.  where  is the weight vector of the function. Equations (3) and (4) represents the objective function of SVR, as follows:  where the positive constant, C, which is the regularization parameter, determines the flatness of the approximation function.  are the input and output variables of the i-th instance, respectively.  is the error tolerance margin of the approximation function and  are slack variables for measuring the distance to the points outside the margin. The SVR input space computation can be performed using the kernel function, which returns the inner product of the input feature vectors, to solve the nonlinear problem by mapping lower-dimensional data into higher-dimensional data. This study used kernels in SVR, as follows (Equation (5)): where  are feature space mapping functions.Using the Lagrangian dual problem and kernel trick, SVR can be expressed as follows (Equation (6)): where  are Lagrange multipliers.2.4.2. Decision TreeA decision tree is a decision-support-tree-like model formed of nodes and edges. In the tree structure, class labels are represented by leaves and feature combinations are represented by branches. A decision tree splits nodes based on the result of the Gini impurity, which is a measure of diversity in a dataset (Equation (7)).  where  is the proportion of samples belonging to class k for the i\u2019th node.2.4.3. Random Forest RegressionRandom forest regression is a bagging ensemble method of decision tree regression that is trained using the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm. The objective function of CART is as follows (Equation (8)): where  are the single feature and threshold, respectively;  is the impurity of the subset; and  is the number of samples of the subset. The ensemble method constructs multiple decision trees using a bagging algorithm known as bootstrap aggression. Each decision tree is trained by a sampling dataset with replacement and is aggregated by the average regression outcomes of the models. RF can mitigate the prediction variance and maintain unbiasedness as compared with a single decision tree.2.4.4. EXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost)XGBoost is an ensemble algorithm that implements gradient-boosted decision trees. Gradient boosting trains weak learners to create a strong ensemble model. Gradient boosting recursively adds a new decision tree model to correct the prior predictor model. Each decision tree was trained on the residual errors of the prior tree model. The sum of all of the prediction outcomes of the trees is the same as the ensemble prediction outcome.2.4.5. Deep Neural Network (DNN)The DNN, which is composed of node layers, consists of an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Each node has a weight and threshold and is activated when the output of the node is above the specified threshold when using the activation function. Batch normalization was used for each layer to avoid gradient vanishing or exploding. The model hyperparameters (the number of hidden layers and number of nodes in each layer) were determined by a grid search, and we determined the number of nodes and layers for the best estimation performance. The hidden layers were composed of three layers with 32, 64, and 32 nodes, respectively. A rectified linear unit was used for the activation function, the mean square error was the loss function used in the training, and Adam was used as an optimizer.2.4.6. Mixture Density Network (MDN)The MDN, which is combined with a convolution network and mixture density model, models the mixture of parametric distributions, as shown in Equations (9) and (10).   where  are the input and output variables, respectively; n is the number of mixture components; and  are mixing coefficients, which are prior probabilities (conditioned on x) corresponding to the mixture weight.  is the conditional density composed of the mean () and variance ().2.5. Model EvaluationUsing 30% of the total data, which were divided in the Bernoulli trial, the validation of the regression models was tested with the mean error and SEE, as shown in Equations (11) and (12).   where  are the measured and estimated values, respectively, and  is the number of test samples.3. ResultsDetailed results of the regression model analysis are presented in Table 4 and Table 5. For each trained regression model, the coefficients of determination (R2), adjusted coefficients of determination, and SEE were used to analyze the estimated explanatory power of the regression models.3.1. Performance Evaluation of the Regression ModelsTable 4 presents a comparison of the FF variable estimation performance in the machine learning models. The DNN models presented the best performance with respect to R2 for estimation of the HGS (R2 = 0.622) and 30 s chair stand (R2 = 0.175), while the random forest model showed the best performance in the estimation of the chair sit-and-reach (R2 = 0.279), figure-of-eight walk (R2 = 0.381), and TUG (R2 = 0.212). For the estimation of the 2 min step test, the MDN model showed the most accurate estimation results (R2 = 0.119). Compared with the linear regression model, with the DNN model, R2 was improved by 3.7% and 1.2% in the HGS and 30 s chair stand estimation, respectively. It was also improved by 0.4% and 15.3% in estimation of the chair sit-and-reach and figure-of-eight walk, respectively, with the random forest model.3.2. Performance Evaluation of the Regression Models without Outlier DataTable 5 shows a comparison of the FF variable estimation performance in machine learning models without outlier data. In this performance evaluation, the outliers in the NFA datasets were removed using SRE to improve the training performance. Additionally, the Boruta algorithm and p-value were applied for feature selection of the input variables, as mentioned in Section 2.3. The input variables with a rank higher than 1 in the Boruta algorithm were excluded in the training (BMI and weight in TUG estimation). Furthermore, the input variables with a p-value higher than 0.05 (sex in the 2 min step test) were also excluded in the model training. The DNN-based regression model showed the best performance with respect to the R2 values for all FF variable estimations. Compared with the previous linear regression model, R2 was improved by 1.1%, 0.6%, 1.1%, 0.6%, 1%, and 1.4% for the HGS, 30 s chair, chair sit-and-reach, figure-of-eight walk, TUG, and 2 min step test with the DNN model. 3.3. Regression Model ValidityTable 6 shows a comparison of the regression models\u2019 validity with the test data, which is 30% of the total data. The mean absolute percentage error ranged from 0.084% to 22.68% in the regression models (DNN model, HGS: MAPE = 0.16% and SEE = 4.135 kg, 30 s chair stand test: MAPE = 0.205% and SEE = 4.169 times, chair sit-and-reach test: MAPE = 20.92% and SEE = 6.228 cm, figure-of-eight walk test: MAPE = 0.097% and SEE = 3.546 s, TUG test: MAPE = 0.084% and SEE = 0.805 s, and 2 min step test: MAPE = 0.099% and SEE = 13.00 times). Figure 2 shows the relationship between the measured and predicted FF variables using scatter plots.4. DiscussionFF variables, which can be used as an index of healthcare, have been used to assess the health conditions of older adults, and several researchers have studied the correlation between independent variables and FF variables. In previous studies, MLR was used to develop a prediction model for the FF variables. However, MLR, which cannot represent the nonlinearity of data, has limitations in estimating FF variables. In addition, prior studies focused on predicting a specific group\u2019s superior physical functionality, such as that of athletes, which is not appropriate for the prediction of FF variables in older adults. The present study focused on developing a regression model for estimating the FF variables of older adults in Korea with easy-to-measure independent variables. To obtain an accurate regression model, we compared various machine learning and deep learning regression models. This study demonstrated the highest performance of the DNN model in FF variable estimation compared with the other regression models. With the developed regression model, it would be helpful to monitor the FF in older adults in daily life.The correlation coefficient shown in Table 2 represents the strength and direction of the linear relation between the input and output variables. In a previous study, height, weight, and BMI were significantly correlated with HGS for older adults. In this study, HGS had a higher correlation coefficient with these independent variables, and presented the most accurate estimation results compared with the other FF variables. From these results, we can infer that it is important to select input variables with a strong correlation in order to obtain higher estimation results. Using nonlinear regression models, we focused on predicting the FF variables of older adults using independent variables. The mean explanatory power of HGS was high in the HGS and DNN regression models (MLR: 61.4%, SVM: 62.1%, RF: 61.9%, XGBoost: 62.0%, DNN: 62.2%, and MDN: 61.7%). In this study, outlier removal and feature selection were conducted. The mean explanatory power of HGS without outlier data was 78.4%, which was the highest value in the DNN model (MLR: 77.3%, SVM: 78.4%, RF: 74.2%, XGBoost: 78.3%, DNN: 78.4%, MDN: 78.3%). Our proposed regression model\u2019s explanatory power of HGS was improved by approximately 25% compared with previous studies. In our previous study, we developed a linear regression model for predicting FF variables of South Korean older adults. However, the previous study did not cover the nonlinearity of the dataset and only used multiple linear regression models without considering other regression models, which may likely improve the prediction accuracy. Hence, we tested various regression models covering data nonlinearity and proposed the best performance regression model. The DNN-based regression model had a better performance than the linear regression model. Comparing the model\u2019s validation, SEE was improved by 16.6% in HGS, 28.2% in 30 s chair stand, 25.9% in chair sit-and-reach, 50.1% in figure-of-eight walk, 56.7% in TUG, and 48.5% in the 2 min step test.The coefficient of determination of the proposed model was too low, making it insufficient for practical applications, except for predicting HGS. The coefficients of determination in the 30 s chair stand (adjusted R2 = 0.300), chair sit-and-reach (adjusted R2 = 0.441), figure-of-eight walk (adjusted R2 = 0.395), TUG (adjusted R2 = 0.389), and 2 min step tests (adjusted R2 = 0.207) were in the mid-range. It was inferred that more input variables were required to analyze the relationship with the FF variables. Hence, additional variables, such as the individual physical activity level or nutrition, which are correlated with the FF variables, were needed to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we used the general older adults\u2019 independent variables, which did not contain their health status, such as personal physical illness/disease information, even though these might be correlated with the FF variables. Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, cause mortality in older adults. Information obtained from blood pressure measurements and blood glucose tests could be used as input variables to predict the correlation with FF variables. These parameters may also be used as indicators to isolate the effects of physical illness/disease information. The DNN-based regression model showed the highest performance for most of the FF variables, but the amount of improvement was <1.6% compared with the other regression models in validation. Selecting machine learning models with a computational efficiency is considered practical for predicting HGS.5. ConclusionsHerein, we proposed an FF variable prediction model based on machine learning and deep learning regression with easy-to-measure independent variables, and compared the performance of each model. This study demonstrated a correlation between older adults\u2019 independent variables and the FF variables, especially HGS. However, the estimation results of the FF variables, except for HGS, were unsatisfactory for monitoring older adults\u2019 physical functionality and providing personalized workout programs. The results showed the difficulty in predicting the FF variables using six independent variables (age, sex, height, weight, percent body fat, and BMI), which were insufficient for representing the correlation of FF variables. In future research, additional variables, including the physical activity level and nutritional status, will be used to enhance the accuracy of the estimation results.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Author ContributionsData curation, S.-H.L.

        "content": "There is limited knowledge about the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Three hundred and thirty-five TNBC samples from four datasets were retrieved and analyzed. In order to determine the CAF subtype by combining gene expression profiles, an unsupervised clustering analysis was adopted. The prognosis, enriched pathways, immune cells, immune scores, and tumor purity were compared between CAF subtypes. The genes with the highest importance were selected by bioinformatics analysis. The machine learning model was built to predict the TNBC CAF subtype by these selected genes. TNBC samples were classified into two CAF subtypes (CAF+ and CAF-).

        "full_text": "Identification of Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Subtype of Triple-Negative Breast CancerBackground There is limited knowledge about the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in the tumor microenvironment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Methods Three hundred and thirty-five TNBC samples from four datasets were retrieved and analyzed. In order to determine the CAF subtype by combining gene expression profiles, an unsupervised clustering analysis was adopted. The prognosis, enriched pathways, immune cells, immune scores, and tumor purity were compared between CAF subtypes. The genes with the highest importance were selected by bioinformatics analysis. The machine learning model was built to predict the TNBC CAF subtype by these selected genes. Results TNBC samples were classified into two CAF subtypes (CAF+ and CAF-). The CAF- subtype of TNBC was linked to the longer overall survival and more immune cells than the CAF+ subtype. CAF- and CAF+ were enriched in immune-related pathways and extracellular matrix pathways, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis identified 9 CAF subtype-related markers (ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, CXCR6, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B).

Conclusion The current study identified CAF subtypes based on gene expression profiles and found that CAF subtypes have significantly different overall survival, immune cells, and immunotherapy response rates.1. IntroductionBreast cancer (BC) has been the most frequent carcinoma and the second cause of cancer death in women. There were more than 2.2 million patients diagnosed with BC and approximately 0.7 million deaths caused by BC in 2020. BC is a heterogeneous disease that includes triple-negative BC (TNBC) and nontriple-negative BC (NTNBC). The absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the characteristic of TNBC (15% to 20% of BC samples). TNBC patients have a worse 5-year survival rate than those with other types of BC. For example, 30% of them could not survive 5 years after diagnosis. Patients with TNBC are treated mainly with chemotherapy, and there are no targeted therapies available for them. There is an urgent need for developing new therapies for TNBC patients.Recent studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment (TME) exerts critical functions in tumor growth and progression control. TME is composed of cancer cells, as well as supporting cells such as stromal cells and infiltrating immune cells. In multiple solid tumor types, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are found as one of the most prevalent stromal cells. CAFs consist of quiescent CAFs (qCAFs), tumor-restraining CAFs (rCAFs), and tumor-promoting CAFs (pCAFs). Among these three types of CAFs, qCAFs and rCAFs are typically found in low-stage cancers, and pCAFs are detected in advanced-stage cancers. A body of research indicates that CAFs play a crucial role in a variety of protumorigenic biological processes, such as invasion of tumor cells, resistance to chemotherapy, and evasion of immune cells. For example, CAFs could contribute to tumor development by providing oxygen and suppressing the immune cells in the TME. However, other studies suggest that CAFs can exert a tumor-suppressive impact on the TME. For example, a previous study discovered that CAFs have a vital suppressive impact on fibrosarcoma. The collection of these research endeavors embodies the importance that the effect of CAFs on TNBC prognosis should be clarified.Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) such as PDL1/PD1 antibodies has been linked to improved clinical outcomes in TNBC, making ICB an appealing treatment option for TNBC patients. Progress-free survival (PFS) was considerably greater in the PD-1 antibody group (9.7 months) than in the control group (5.6 months) in a randomized, double-blind, phase III TNBC trial (NCT02819518) (p value = 0.0012). However, only 18.5 percent of TNBC samples from the KEYNOTE012 trial reacted to PD1/PDL1 antibodies, which is far from satisfactory. According to the new research, TNBC is not a unique illness, and the identification of subgroups/subtypes within TNBC samples might contribute to finding the right patients for PD1/PDL1 antibodies.Toward this purpose, we analyzed and compared CAF subtypes from the discovery datasets of TNBC samples, as well as disclosed their molecular and biological properties. In the training dataset, the CAF+ subtype was linked to poor prognosis. We then built a prediction model to predict CAF subtypes using a machine learning method based on 9 genes. The predicted CAF subtypes of samples from an independent breast cancer dataset showed that the CAF+ subtype had a poor clinical outcome. Results from ICB datasets also demonstrated that the CAF subtypes have a crucial effect on TNBC resistance to ICB.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Patients and SpecimensFour TNBC datasets and 335 samples were utilized as discovery datasets for CAF subtype classification. These four datasets came from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The discovery datasets included GSE19615 (28 TNBC samples), GSE21653 (84 TNBC samples), GSE58812 (107 TNBC samples), and TCGA (116 TNBC samples). Based on the R GEOquery package, the normalized expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812 were retrieved from the GEO website by the accession numbers. The TCGA-TNBC dataset's level 3 raw count expression profiles were retrieved using the \u2018TCGAbiolinks' R package. The dates for downloading expression profiles from the TCGA and GEO datasets were September 20, 2021 and September 27, 2021. The created fibroblast subtype was verified using an independent breast cancer dataset (the METABRIC dataset). 313 ER-negative and HER2-negative breast cancers with obtainable overall survival (OS) information and gene expression matrix were retrieved from METABRIC.The link between CAF subtypes and ICB response was assessed using three different datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) comprising patients treated with ICB. GSE78220 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-1 therapy in 28 melanoma samples. GSE35640 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy in 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples. IMvigor210 contains pretreatment mRNA expression data from anti-PD-L1 therapy in 348 cancer samples.2.2. Batch Effect Correction and Consensus Clustering (CC) AnalysisUsing the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) R program, the expression profiles of GSE19615, GSE21653, GSE58812, and TCGA-TNBC were converted into the matrix of CAF gene sets. CAF related biomarkers and gene sets were summarized from studies and listed in Supplementary Table 1. The batch effect was shown using principal component analysis (PCA) before and after the conversion. The consensus clustering algorithm from the R \u2018ConsensusClusterPlus' package was used to determine the probable CAF subtypes by the expression matrix of CAF gene sets. The optimal cluster number for the consensus clustering algorithm was chosen based on the tracking plot, delta area, the average silhouette width value, and CDF results.2.3. Single-Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATEIn the supplementary data from Bindea's study, the gene sets corresponding to immune cells were obtained. By applying the ssGSEA method from the GSVA package, the enrichment scores of 28 immune cells for the TNBC sample were measured by the gene expression matrix. By the ESTIMATE algorithm, stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were computed by the gene expression matrix. The values of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity were then normalized of \u2018min-max normalization.' Min-max normalization is one of the most frequently used methods for data normalization. The minimum value of stromal, immune scores, and tumor purity was converted into 0, the highest value was converted into 1, and other values were then transformed into a value range from 0 to 1. Our next step was to compare the differences between the different CAF subtypes by Student's t-test.2.4. Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Screening and Enrichment AnalysisIn order to select the key genes among the two CAF subtypes, we used the DEG analysis. Packages, including \u2018limma,' \u2018edgeR,' and \u2018DESeq2,' are the most popular and accurate methods for DEG analysis. The principles and the preferred data for these three DEG methods are different. The linear model is adopted in the \u2018limma' package, but \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' packages calculated the DEGs by the negative binomial distribution. The differential expression test for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018DESeq2' are exact test, and the differential expression test for \u2018limma' is empirical Bayes method. Besides, the input data for \u2018edgeR' and \u2018limma' must be the expression profiles after the normalization. For the datasets with a small number of replicates, \u2018limma' is the safest choice. We do not use DESeq2 to obtain the DEGs among the two CAF subtypes because more computer resources and time are needed in the process of calculation. Since the samples from GEO datasets are smaller in GSE19615, GSE21653, and GSE58812, the DEGs were analyzed using the R package \u201climma\u201d. In the TCGA-TNBC dataset, which contains more samples, \u201cedgeR\u201d package was used to determine the DEGs between two subtypes. The DEGs with p value < 0.05 and \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 for each dataset were then filtered.The robust rank aggregation (RRA) approach, which can decrease dataset bias, was utilized to combine the filtered DEGs from the above four expression datasets. The RRA approach is based on the assumption that a gene will be considered a robust DEG if it ranks first in all of the DEG gene lists. RRA computed significance scores for all genes, and only the statistically important genes were kept. To get robust DEGs among diverse datasets, RRA was used using the \u201cRobustRankAggreg\u201d package in R language. The DEGs were selected by the cutoff of \u2223log2(foldchange) | >0.5 and p value < 0.05. Then, functional Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome enrichment analyses were conducted. Using the OS information, the differences of DEGs survival curves were calculated. And the prognostic-related genes were selected by the cutoff of p value < 0.05, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier model was conducted to illustrate the difference between survival curves.2.5. CAF Subtype Prediction ModelUsing random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approaches from the R package \u201ccaret,\u201d we constructed CAF subtype predictors. The package \u2018caret' is a prevalent application for building prediction models and contains many prevalent machine learning approaches. During the model training process, prognostic-related genes expression data were utilized. In the first step, the expression data was randomly divided into the training dataset (50 percent) and the testing dataset (50 percent). Afterward, the parameter search accompanied by the fivefold cross-validation procedure was applied. We compared the prediction accuracy of machine learning models, and the machine learning model with the highest value of area under the curve (AUC) was selected. Then, the genes with the highest importance were kept in model construction. The testing dataset was then used to assess the developed model's ability to predict. Finally, the CAF subtypes of samples from the METABRIC dataset were predicted by the constructed model, and the METABRIC dataset was used as an independent validation dataset to confirm the CAF subtypes and prognosis association.2.6. Protein Expression Profiles of Selected Genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)The protein values of hub genes were calculated based on the data from HPA data. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was represented by a number: not detected/negative (0), low (1), medium (2), and high (3). The IHC intensity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), weak (1), moderate (2), and strong (3). The IHC quantity was represented by a number: none/negative (0), <25% (1), 25\u201375% (2), and >75% (3). The IHC score was determined by the sum of staining intensity and the staining quantity.2.7. Statistical AnalysisR language was used to implement the statistical analysis. For the purpose of examining the differences between two groups, Student's t-test was implemented. If not stated otherwise, p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. CAF Subtypes with Distinct Survival RatesGSVA was used to convert the gene-expression matrix of 4 datasets into the matrix of CAF gene sets. Before the conversion, PCA revealed a clear batch effect among these 4 datasets (Figure 1(a)). The batch effect was successfully reduced after the conversion, according to PCA findings (Figure 1(b)). To obtain the accurate CAF subtypes among TNBC samples, we performed CC on the matrix of CAF gene sets. The parameter of clustering numbers from 2 to 6 was selected by the tracking plot, delta area, and CDF results. The results from tracking plot suggested \u201c2\u201d (Figure 1(c)). The CDF plot suggested \u201c4\u201d (Figure 1(d)), and the relative change area under CDF plot suggested \u201c3\u201d (Figure 1(e)). The average silhouette values were used for optimal cluster number selection (Figure 1(f)). It is a numeric number between 0 and 1, and a high silhouette value implies that the sample is well-suited to its own cluster but weakly related to other clusters. The average silhouette values suggested \u20182' (Figure 1(f)). The p values from OS and progression-free survival (PFS) analysis if the clustering number was set as \u201c3\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1A) were 0.091 and 0.02 (Supplementary Figure 1B-C). The p values from OS and PFS analyses if the clustering number was set as \u201c4\u201d (Supplementary Figure 1D) were 0.23 and 0.043 (Supplementary Figure 1E-F). Thus, the cluster number was finally set as 2 (Figure 1G) because its p values (OS: 0.025; PFS: <0.001) in the OS and PFS analyses were significant (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Patients in C1 witnessed a significant increase in the OS and PFS time than C2. The proportion of CAF subtypes across different clinical and pathological aspects of TNBC patients was depicted in Table 1. The result indicated that CAF subtypes had no relationships with clinical and pathological parameters such as dataset, age, and stage. Among these two subtypes, C1 had higher levels of PD1 and PDL1 (Supplementary Figure 2).3.2. CAF Subtypes with Distinct CAF and Immune CellsThe levels of CAF gene sets were significantly different between two CAF subtypes (Figure 2(c)). C2 subtypes had significantly higher levels of most CAF gene sets; thus, this subtype was named \u201cCAF+\u201d subtype. The C1 was named \u201cCAF\u2212 subtype\u201d since it lacked most types of CAF gene sets. Interestingly, unlike other CAF genes sets, the chemokine biomarkers were significantly in CAF- subtype.We also explored and compared the immune cells between two CAF subtypes. The CAF- subtype had higher levels of immune cells infiltration (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, CAF- samples had higher immune scores, lower stromal scores, and lower tumor purity, while CAF+ samples had lower immune scores, higher stromal scores, and greater tumor purity (p value < 0.001, Student's t-test, Figures 3(b)\u20133(d)).3.3. Analysis of DEGs and Enrichment AnalysisDEGs were identified between CAF subtypes (p value < 0.05 and log2FoldChange > 0.5; Supplementary Figure 3). In CAF+ samples, there were 895 (GSE19615), 649 (GSE21653), 711 (GSE58812), and 890 (TCGA-TNBC) upregulated expressed genes. There were 526 (GSE19615), 848 (GSE21653), 1061 (GSE58812), and 960 (TCGA-TNBC) elevated expressed genes in the CAF- subtype. The RRA approach identified 553 robust DEGs, including 262 upregulated and 291 downregulated genes in the CAF+ subtype. The heatmap was used to visualize the selected robust DEGs (Figure 4(a)).Enrichment analysis was used to find the enriched pathways associated with 553 robust DEGs. In Supplementary Figure 4, CAF- subtype was largely associated with immune pathways, including \u2018leukocyte-activation' (GO), \u2018regulation-of-leukocyte-proliferation' (GO), and \u2018regulation-of-antigen-receptor' (GO), \u2018cytokine-and-cytokine-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018chemokine-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018hematopoietic-cell-lineage' (KEGG), and \u2018immunoregulatory-interactions' (REACTOME). On the other hand, the pathways related to extracellular-matrix-organization were found in CAF+ subtype such as \u2018TGF-beta-signaling-pathway' (KEGG), \u2018focal-adhesion' (KEGG), and \u2018ECM-receptor-interaction' (KEGG), \u2018degradation-of-the-extracellular-matrix' (REACTOME), and \u2018regulation-of-cellular-response-to-growth-factor-stimulus' (REACTOME).3.4. Selection of Genes and Construction of Machine Learning ModelsBased on 553 robust DEGs, 59 prognostic-related genes were identified using a univariate Cox regression model. The expression of these genes was used to construct the RF model to predict the CAF subtype. The available TNBC samples were divided into the training (50 percent) and testing datasets (50 percent). Gene expression values were discretized by the median value into discrete values. Based on the parameter search and the fivefold cross-validation procedure in the training dataset, the prediction abilities of machine learning models such as RF, KNN, and DT were evaluated. Among these three machine learning models, RF that showed the highest AUC value was selected. According to the highest values of areas under the curve for the RF model, \u201cmtry\u2009=24\u201d was selected (Table 2). In Supplementary Table 2, 9 variables/genes were prioritized and shown according to their importance. The RF model was trained by these 9 genes on the training dataset. An AUC value of 0.921 was obtained in the testing dataset by the constructed RF model (Figure 4(b)).3.5. Predictive Model Validation by an Independent Breast Cancer DatasetThese 9 genes selected for model construction were collagen type X alpha 1 (COL10A1), a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-12 (ADAMTS12), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1), endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6), Wnt family member 7B (WNT7B), C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), adipocyte enhancer binding protein 1 (AEBP1), and Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1). These genes were selected as CAF subtype-related genes.Based on the expression matrix of 9 genes from the METABRIC dataset, the CAF subtype was predicted. A higher prognosis was observed for CAF- subtype samples compared to CAF+ subtype samples (p value = 0.0046, Figure 4(c)). The CAF+ subtype samples in the validation dataset had higher levels of CAF gene sets than the CAF- subtype (Figure 4(d)). It is also worth noting that these results were also consistent with the training data (Figures 2(a) and 2(c)).3.6. Investigation of CAF Subtype-Related Genes with Prognosis and CAF SubtypesIn the TCGA-TNBC dataset, ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B were correlated with poor prognosis when their expression values were high (Figure 5). The positive outcome was correlated with the high expression values of CXCL11 and CXCR6 (Figure 5). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, CXCL11, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their expression values were higher in tumor samples than in normal samples (Supplementary Figure 5A). For ADAMTS12, AEBP1, COL10A1, COL11A1, EDNRA, EPPK1, and WNT7B, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF+ samples than CAF- samples (Supplementary Figure 5B). For CXCL11 and CXCR6, their mRNA expression values were higher in CAF- samples than CAF+ samples (Supplementary Figure 5B).3.7. Evaluation of CAF Subtype's Influence on Immunotherapy ResponseTo test the CAF subtype prediction model, three independent datasets (GSE78220, GSE35640, and IMvigor210) containing RNA sequencing data of patients before immunotherapy were chosen to evaluate the CAF subtype's influence on immunotherapy response. GSE78220 contains 28 melanoma samples treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, GSE35640 contains 65 melanoma and lung cancer samples treated with MAGE-A3 immunotherapeutic therapy, and IMvigor210 contains 348 cancer samples treated with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Patients from these cohorts were classified into CAF+ or CAF- subtypes by the expression levels of 9 genes (COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1). Within GSE78220 (Figure 6(a)), GSE35640 (Figure 6(b)), and IMvigor210 (Figure 6(c)), the response rates were different by 11%, 24%, and 10%, respectively. There was a greater gain in OS with CAF- than with CAF+ (Figure 6(d)).3.8. Expression Validation for CAF Subtype-Related Genes in Breast CancerAmong the nine selected genes, protein expression data of ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, EDNRA, and EPPK1 were available in the HPA dataset. The IHC score results demonstrated that ADAMTS12, AEBP1, CXCL11, and EPPK1 protein levels were higher in breast cancer samples than in normal controls (Supplementary Figure 6).4. DiscussionRecent studies have found that CAF participates in angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation, treatment resistance, immunomodulation, and metastases in solid tumors such as breast cancer. However, current research is very limited concerning CAF's role in breast cancer. According to our study, the degree of CAF in TME is greater in patients with the worse prognosis, and it is suggested that CAF is one of the independent prognostic factors. We also estimated the correlation of CAF subtypes with tumor purity, immune cell infiltration, and response rate to ICB. The results suggested that CAF might exert its effect on prognosis by promoting tumor cells and inhibiting immune cells such as CD8 T cells.Among two CAF subtypes, immune cells were found to be higher in the CAF- subtype than in the CAF+ subtype. Similarly, immune related pathways such as \u2018cytokine-cytokine-receptor-interaction,' \u2018T-cell-receptor-signaling,' \u2018chemokine-signaling,' nad \u2018natural-killer-cell-mediated-cytotoxicity' were higher in the CAF- subtype. As a result of these findings, we can assume that CAF is associated with a microenvironment that suppresses immunity. CD8+ T cells could further differentiate into effector cells to kill tumor cells. CAF was reported to suppress CD8+ T cells by PDL2 and FASL. CAF could secrete IL6 that could increase regulatory T cells and decrease CD8+ T cell. In breast cancer, fibroblast activation protein- (FAP-) positive CAF could suppress immune by enhancing the regulatory T cells and inhibiting T cell effectors. Since the tumor-infiltrating T cell is one of the crucial biomarkers for indicating the ICB response, the CAF subtypes could also affect the therapeutic efficacy of ICB. Studies show that CAFs decrease sensitivity to anti-PD-L1 treatment. The result from independent ICB datasets also shows that patients in CAF+ subtype have a lower response rate and worse prognosis to ICB. Thus, CAF- subtype patients are the ideal candidates for receiving ICB. Besides, targeting CAF might be a promising therapeutic approach, in complement to conventional treatments and immunotherapies.Chemokines including CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL16 could be derived from CAF. For example, using western blotting assay and immunofluorescence, CXCL5 expression was high in CAFs. However, the resources of these chemokines are multiple. CXCL5 can be produced by tumor cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Dendritic cells (DCs) could release CXCL5, CXCL9 and use these chemokines to recruit immune cells such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells into the TME. Since the immune cells are found to be inhibited in CAF+ subtype, these results suggest that the CAF is not the main resource of these chemokines.COL10A1 and COL11A1, as members of the collagen family, are upregulated in breast cancer fibroblasts. ADAMTS12 is a secreted metalloprotease and plays a protumoral role in breast cancer by increasing the capacity for migration and invasion of breast cancer tumor cells. It has been found that inhibiting EDNRA could inhibit the invasion of BC tumor cells. WNT7B is one of the Wnt pathway proteins, and clinical outcome of BC patients with high expression of WNT7B is poor. AEBP1 is one of the transcriptional repressors that could improve BC progression through extracellular matrix thickening. EPPK1 is part of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal and is found to promote the proliferation of tumor cells. CXCR6 and CXCL11 are members of chemokines, and CXCR6 is required for antitumor efficacy of CD8+ T cell infiltration. However, another study found that CXCR6 could increase cell migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. This phenomenon might be caused by the diverse origins of chemokines, and more studies are needed to clarify their roles in TNBC.The study has some limitations. Firstly, we only used pure bioinformatics techniques to predict CAF in TME. In order to ensure the robustness of our findings, we selected multiple independent datasets. Secondly, there are no specific biomarkers for CAF because of the high heterogeneity of CAF origin, phenotype, and function. The biomarkers of distinct CAF subgroups may be different, even opposite. Lastly, the differences among CAFs were overlooked in our study.5. ConclusionCAF is linked to lower survival rates for TNBC patients and suppressed immune activity. In summary, CAF could lead to the decreased ICB response rate. Simultaneously, the random forest model composed of COL10A1, ADAMTS12, COL11A1, EDNRA, CXCR6, WNT7B, CXCL11, AEBP1, and EPPK1 is a promising tool for the prediction of the CAF subtype.Data AvailabilityThe datasets were downloaded from the TCGA database (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).Ethical ApprovalAll the expression data and clinical information were retrieved from publicly available datasets which were free to download and analyze without limitations.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterised by the lack of oestrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is a more aggressive breast cancer than other subtypes that correlate with poor prognosis. Most patients with TNBC are categorised as having a robust tumour lymphocytic infiltrate compared to other subtypes. Therefore, TNBC is considered the most immunogenic subtype. Recently, the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumour cells and/or immune cells in breast cancer tissues has received much attention because of its effectiveness in anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. It has been reported that PD-L1 expression in tumour cells was associated with higher histological grade, hormone receptor-negative phenotype, poor prognostic outcome, and lymph node status in breast cancer. Moreover, previous studies revealed that PD-L1 expression in both tumour and immune cells was the highest in TNBC compared to other subtypes.Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are considered to produce a pro-tumourigenic microenvironment and are some of its dominant components. CAFs have been known to play important roles in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance through the secretion of various soluble factors, including chemokines, growth factors, and exosomes in some types of carcinomas, including breast cancer. Although PD-L1 expression has been demonstrated in subsets of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, its expression in CAFs has not yet been analysed in detail. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs of non-small cell lung carcinoma tissues has been demonstrated to correlate with good patient prognosis. However, PD-L1 expression in CAFs has never been analysed in breast cancer tissues, and its prognostic significance remains to be clarified. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine PD-L1 expression in CAFs of TNBC tissues and its prognostic significance in patients with TNBC.MethodsPatient selectionWe enrolled 165 consecutive patients with TNBC who underwent surgical resection from January 2006 to December 2018 at the Department of Surgery of the Kansai Medical University Hospital. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study because this chemotherapy may influence PD-L1 expression and may also have an impact on the patient prognosis. Patients who were diagnosed with invasive carcinoma of no special type according to the recent World Health Organization Classification of Breast Tumours were selected. Patients with special types of invasive carcinoma were excluded from the study, because each special type of carcinoma has unique clinicopathological features; hence, 61 patients with TNBC comprised this study cohort. The present cohort was fundamentally the same as that of our previous study. In the previous study, we analysed the relationship between adipophilin expression, a lipid droplet-associated protein, and the clinicopathological features of TNBC patients. The content of this study did not overlap with that of our previous one.This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Kansai Medical University Hospital (Approval #2019041).Histopathological analysisHistopathological features were independently evaluated by more than two experienced pathologists. We used the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumours, Eighth Edition. Histopathological grading was based on the Nottingham histological grade. The Ki-67 labelling index (LI) was considered high when \u226540% of the neoplastic cells were labelled. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified using haematoxylin and eosin staining, and were considered lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC) at \u226560% and non-LPBC at less than 60%, according to the TIL Working Group recommendation.Tissue microarrayThe most morphologically representative carcinoma regions were selected on haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and three tissue cores (2\u2009mm in diameter) were punched out from the paraffin-embedded blocks for each patient. These tissue cores were arrayed in a paraffin blocks.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemical stainings were performed using autostainers (SP142 and E1L3N assays on Discovery ULTRA System; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland; and 73\u201310 assay on Leica Bond-III; Leica Biosystems, Bannockburn, IL). Three different primary monoclonal antibodies were used to detect PD-L1: SP142 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), E1L3N (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and 73\u201310 (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). A minimum of two researchers independently evaluated the immunohistochemical staining results.Spindle-shaped non-neoplastic cells in tumour stroma were morphologically recognized as CAFs, and membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression of PD-L1 in these cells was considered positive. PD-L1 expression scores of CAFs were determined based on the staining intensity and were classified into three levels (0, negative; +\u20091, weak; +\u20092, strong). As previously reported, CAF PD-L1 positivity was defined as the presence of CAFs with staining intensities of +\u20091 and\u2009+\u20092 in more than 1% of a section and positive immunoreactivity of \u22651 from the same patient. In addition, PD-L1 expression in stromal TILs was defined as expression in more than 5% of TILs (TIL PD-L1-positive).Double immunofluorescence stainingFor immunofluorescence analysis, a primary mouse monoclonal antibody against \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) (SPM332, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and primary rabbit monoclonal antibody against PD-L1 (73\u201310, ab228415, Abcam) were used. Subsequently, secondary antibodies of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 [ab150081]) and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor\u00ae 568 (ab175701) were used. The immunofluorescence stain was analysed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX53F, Tokyo, Japan).Statistical analysesSPSS Statistics 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to perform the statistical analyses. Correlations between two groups were calculated using Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. The rates of relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between clinicopathological parameters and survival. A multivariate analysis was performed using a step-wise method. A p-value of <\u20090.05 was considered to be significant.ResultsClinicopathological featuresClinical characteristics of patients with triple-negative breast cancerFactors\tn\t%\t \tTotal\t61\t\t \tAge (years old)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t67 (31\u201393)\t\t \tMenopausal status\t \t\u2003Premenopausal\t9\t14.8\t \t\u2003Postmenopausal\t51\t83.6\t \t\u2003Unknown\t1\t1.6\t \tTumour size (mm)\t \t\u2003Median (range)\t20 (2\u201355)\t\t \tPathological stage\t \t\u2003I\t25\t41.0\t \t\u2003IIA\t23\t37.7\t \t\u2003IIB\t5\t8.2\t \t\u2003IIIA\t4\t6.6\t \t\u2003IIIB\t3\t4.9\t \t\u2003IIIC\t1\t1.6\t \tLymph node status\t \t\u2003positive\t14\t23.0\t \t\u2003negative\t33\t54.0\t \t\u2003not tested\t14\t23.0\t \tLymphatic invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t52\t85.2\t \t\u2003negative\t9\t14.8\t \tVenous invasion\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tNottingham histological grade\t \t\u20031\t2\t3.3\t \t\u20032\t27\t44.3\t \t\u20033\t32\t52.5\t \tKi-67 labeling index (LI)\t \t\u2003high\t36\t59.0\t \t\u2003low\t21\t34.4\t \t\u2003not tested\t4\t6.6\t \tStromal TILs\t \t\u2003LPB\t19\t31.1\t \t\u2003non-LPBC\t42\t68.9\t \tPD-L1 on stromal TILs (73\u201310\t \t\u2003positive\t37\t60.7\t \t\u2003negative\t24\t39.3\t \tAdjuvant chemotherapy\t \t\u2003performed\t34\t55.7\t \t\u2003not performed\t24\t39.3\t \t\u2003undetermined\t3\t4.9\t \tLPBC lymphocyte predominant breast cancerThis study comprised 61 female patients whose clinical characteristics are summarised in Table\u00a01.

Only TIL PD-L1 expression was significantly correlated with CAF PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CAF PD-L1 expression according to the SP-142 and E1L3N assays was also significantly associated with TIL PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u00a00.001 for both), similar to the 73\u201310 assay (Tables\u00a03, 4). Correlation between CAF PD-L1 expression and postoperative RFSThe median RFS in CAF PD-L1-positive patients evaluated with 73\u201310, SP-142, and E1L3N was 59, 61, and 61\u2009months, respectively.

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses revealed that CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent factor for a better prognosis of patients with TNBC (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.198; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.044\u20130.891; p\u2009=\u20090.035) (Table 5). Moreover, presence of lymph node metastasis and no adjuvant chemotherapy were found to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS (HR: 12.56, 95% CI: 2.465\u201363.99, p\u2009=\u20090.002, and HR: 20.27, 95% CI: 3.041\u2013153.1, p\u2009=\u00a00.002, respectively). DiscussionRecent studies on various types of carcinomas have highlighted the important roles of the tumour microenvironment components, including TILs, in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CAFs are some of the dominant components of the tumour microenvironment. CAFs have also been increasing interests in several types of carcinomas, such as head and neck, lung, and rectal carcinomas, because they have been considered to have essential functions in cancer growth and prognosis. Recently, PD-L1 expression in CAFs reportedly demonstrated a significantly better prognostic value in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, the significance of CAFs in breast cancer has not received enough attention.In the present study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with TNBC and had two main findings: (1) CAF PD-L1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with TNBC and (2) the 73\u201310 PD-L1 assay would be more suitable for evaluating CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC, compared to the other two assays. The histopathological grade, lymph node status, tumour size, and Ki-67 LI have been identified as the prognostic factors in patients with TNBC. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that upregulation of PD-L1 was correlated with a good prognosis in patients with TNBC. In our study, a multivariate analysis of OS showed that lymph node status and adjuvant chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors, but histological grade and Ki-67 LI were not. Notably, CAF PD-L1 expression was also established as a significantly better prognostic factor (p\u2009=\u20090.035). These results indicate that CAF PD-L1 expression is a novel and useful prognostic factor for OS in patients with TNBC.It is well known that high PD-L1 expression in the tumour microenvironment is a poor prognostic factor. Stromal PD-L1 was also reported to inhibit the immune responses of CD8-positive T lymphocytes in colorectal cancer. In addition, the expression of PD-L1 on CD8-positive T-cells was a poor prognostic factor in patients with TNBC. These findings suggest that high PD-L1 expression on CAFs could also suppress anti-tumour immune responses through the exhaustion of PD-1-positive lymphocytes. However, in our study, high CAF PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with better prognosis. Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that patients with PD-L1 expression on CAFs had a significantly better prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, similar to the results of the present cohort analysis. It was also shown that interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) activated PD-L1 expression on CAFs. PD-L1 on CAFs was upregulated through interaction with IFN-\u03b3, hence releasing activated lymphocytes; furthermore, PD-L1 expression on CAFs indicated abundant infiltration of TILs in the tumour microenvironment. Nevertheless, there was no significant association between CAF PD-L1 expression and TILs in non-small cell lung cancer and TNBC assessed with the 73\u201310 assay in our study (stromal TILs were significantly associated with CAF PD-L1 positivity when assessed using SP142 and E1L3N assays in the present cohort). Thus, immune cells other than TILs such as macrophages might have played a role in this discrepancy for specific sources of IFN-\u03b3. Further studies are hence needed to clarify the underlying molecular mechanism.Several immunohistochemical assays for PD-L1 have been independently developed for companion diagnostics to determine the indication for anti-PD-L1/PD1 targeted therapy. Interestingly, only CAF PD-L1 expression determined using the 73\u201310 assay was significantly correlated with better OS (results of the SP-142 and E1L3N assays did not) in our cohort. The 73\u201310 antibody is known to bind to the region of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1. Although SP-142 and E1L3N are also known to bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, it has been reported that they have slightly different binding sites. SP142 binds to an epitope in the cytoplasmic domain at the extreme C-terminus, and several mutations lead to lack of immunostaining for SP142. Although the specific binding site of 73\u201310 has not been reported, it is speculated that 73\u201310 binds to a different intracytoplasmic domain of PD-L1, from those of SP142 and E1L3N, resulting in the difference in staining properties in non-small cell lung cancer. CAF PD-L1 expression was detected the most by the 73\u201310 assay, compared to the SP142 and E1L3N assays; this might be a reflection of the difference of binding sites among primary antibodies. The 73\u201310 antibody would therefore be more suitable for studying PD-L1 expression in CAFs of patients with TNBC. Furthermore, in this study, we demonstrated that spindle cells around the tumour cells co-expressed \u03b1-SMA and PD-L1 with immunofluorescence staining, and these cells were considered as PD-L1-expressing CAFs, because \u03b1-SMA is one of the most common markers of CAFs in breast cancer.Nevertheless, it is important to note that some limitations were present in our study. This was a retrospective study with a small sample size that could have led to selection bias. Because tissue microarrays were used to determine CAF PD-L1 expression, cancer tissue may have shown heterogeneous expression, despite that we have selected the morphologically most representative regions of the cancer tissue. Finally, this study was focussed on the expression of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC. PD-L1 expression in stromal cells differs among molecular subtypes of breast cancer, hence CAF PD-L1 expression might also be different in luminal and HER2 subtypes. Further analyses are needed to clarify the prognostic value of CAF PD-L1 expression in patients with breast cancer subtypes other than the TNBC.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that CAF PD-L1 expression is an independent better prognostic factor in patients with TNBC, which could have implications in diagnosis, disease management, and the development of targeted therapeutics. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in CAF PD-L1 expression in TNBC and to develop therapeutic interventions for patients with CAF PD-L1-positive TNBC. Moreover, the 73\u201310 assay may be the most suitable for immunostaining of CAF PD-L1 in TNBC.AbbreviationsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsHER2Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2IFN-\u03b3Interferon gammaKi-67 LIKi-67 labelling indexOSOverall survivalPD-L1Programmed death ligand 1RFSRelapse-free survivalTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerTILsTumour-infiltrating lymphocytesPublisher\u2019s NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Authors\u2019 contributionsKY analysed and interpreted the patient data regarding the triple negative breast cancer.

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) have recently been implicated in important aspects of epithelial solid tumor biology, such as neoplastic progression, tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. However, neither the source of CAFs nor the differences between CAFs and fibroblasts from nonneoplastic tissue have been well defined. In this study, we show that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exposed to tumor-conditioned medium (TCM) over a prolonged period of time assume a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype. More importantly, these cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including sustained expression of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and the ability to promote tumor cell growth both in vitro and in an in vivo coimplantation model, and expression of myofibroblast markers, including alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast surface protein. hMSCs induced to differentiate to a myofibroblast-like phenotype using 5-azacytidine do not promote tumor cell growth as efficiently as hMSCs cultured in TCM nor do they show increased SDF-1 expression. Furthermore, gene expression profiling revealed similarities between TCM-exposed hMSCs and CAFs. Taken together, these data suggest that hMSCs are a source of CAFs and can be used in the modeling of tumor-stroma interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that hMSCs become activated and resemble carcinoma-associated myofibroblasts on prolonged exposure to conditioned medium from MDAMB231 human breast cancer cells.",

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key actors in the context of the tumor microenvironment. Despite being reduced in number as compared to tumor cells, CAFs regulate tumor progression and provide protection from antitumor immunity. Emerging anticancer strategies aim to remodel the tumor microenvironment through the ablation of pro-tumorigenic CAFs or reprogramming of CAFs functions and their activation status. A promising approach is the development of nanosized delivery agents able to target CAFs, thus allowing the specific delivery of drugs and active molecules. In this context, a cellular model of CAFs may provide a useful tool for in vitro screening and preliminary investigation of such nanoformulations. This study describes the isolation and culture of primary CAFs from the syngeneic 4T1 murine model of triple-negative breast cancer. Magnetic beads were used in a 2-step separation process to extract CAFs from dissociated tumors. Immunophenotyping control was performed using flow cytometry after each passage to verify the process yield. Isolated CAFs can be employed to study the targeting capability of different nanoformulations designed to tackle the tumor microenvironment. Fluorescently labeled H-ferritin nanocages were used as candidate nanoparticles to set up the method. Nanoparticles, either bare or conjugated with a targeting ligand, were analyzed for their binding to CAFs. The results suggest that ex vivo extraction of breast CAFs may be a useful system to test and validate nanoparticles for the specific targeting of tumorigenic CAFs.",

Several mechanisms have been reported to activate MDR in such cancers, including reduced apoptosis, advanced DNA damage repair mechanisms, altered drug metabolism, mutation or over expression of the drug's targets, drug inactivation, or efflux of the drug from the cell. P-glycoprotein 1 (permeability glycoprotein, abbreviated as P-gp or Pgp), also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) or ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) or cluster of differentiation 243 (CD243), is a glycoprotein that, in humans, is encoded by the ABCB1 gene. Overexpression of ABCB1 causes therapeutic drugs to be pumped out of the cancer cells thus preventing effective treatment. Since ABCB1 expression in normal tissues leads to higher toxicity in cancer treatment using an ABCB1 inhibitor, researchers have focused on the molecular pathway of MDR cancer cells as a strategy in the development of new molecular targets.Wnt proteins are crucial signaling molecules which are involved not only in physiological development, decision of stem cell fate but also in oncogenesis and cross-talk between signaling pathways. Canonical Wnt proteins such as Wnt3A stabilize \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus through binding with the Frizzle proteins of the cell membrane. Furthermore, Wnt5A was a well-discussed non-canonical Wnt protein that plays an important role in many physiological processes, including planar cell polarity (PCP), Wnt calcium signaling pathway, axon guidance, stem cell functions, antagonization of canonical Wnt proteins, and macrophage-induced malignant invasion. Although Wnt-5A is thought to have primarily functions in the non-canonical pathway, it also has functions in \u03b2-catenin stabilization.Recent studies indicated that ABCB1 expression was controlled by Wnt signaling in MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, Wnt signaling inhibition resensitizes MDR cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. However, these studies have been confined to canonical Wnt protein-related signaling of drug resistant cancer cells. Furthermore, our previous studies indicated that Wnt-targeting genes, including c-Myc and cyclin D1, were upregulated and were relevant in inhibiting the expression of p21 in MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Moreover, we also found that the canonical Wnt pathway was only activated in ABCB1-overexpressed MES-SA/Dx5 cells through active \u03b2-catenin and related transactivation activities regulating the cell cycle.Since little is known about the non-canonical Wnt protein-related pathway in drug resistant cancer cells, we have attempted in this study to investigate the role of the non-canonical Wnt5A in drug-resistant cancer cells. Herein, the non-canonical Wnt5A was upregulated in two multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines, MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells. The data indicated that Wnt5A stabilized \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus through the PKA pathway in both drug-resistant cells. Furthermore, neutralization of Wnt5A inhibited growth of the drug-resistant cells. Moreover, inhibition of Wnt5A by shRNA led to resensitization of the cells to doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. Besides, Wnt5A expression level was positively correlated with ABCB1 and VEGF expression levels in the clinical breast cancer tissues. Taken together, Wnt5A-controlled PKA/\u03b2-catenin signaling regulate upregulation of ABCB1, cyclin D1, c-Myc and VEGF in MDR cancer cells for increased survival advantage under chemotherapeutic treatment.RESULTSWnt signaling is activated in two multidrug-resistant cancer cell linesSince the Wnt pathway is correlated to ABCB1 expression level in multidrug resistant cells, the ABCB1, \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein levels were evaluated in the parental uterus sarcoma MES-SA and the breast cancer MCF7 cell lines in relation to their drug resistant counterparts, MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2, respectively. The data showed higher expression levels of ABCB1, \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 in the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 1A). Furthermore, lower phosphorylation status of \u03b2-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) and higher phosphorylation levels of GSK3\u03b2 (Ser9) were also detected in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 1A). Expression levels of the Wnt genes were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. The data indicated that Wnt2, Wnt5A and Wnt7A were upregulated in MES-SA/Dx5 cells compared to MES-SA cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). Interestingly, Wnt5A alone, among other Wnt genes, showed significantly increased levels in MES-SA/Dx5 (Supplementary Figure 1B). In both cases, elevated TOP activities and higher Wnt5A mRNA levels were concurrently detected in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figures 1B and C). The data indicated that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Wnt5A were upregulated in MDR cells. Wnt5A expression level was assessed by western blot, which demonstrated that higher expression levels of cellular Wnt5A and secreted Wnt5A in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, higher expression levels of cellular Wnt5A and secreted Wnt5A were also observed in the multidrug-resistant KB-V1, NCI/ADR-RES and SW620-MDR1 cells of the cervix, ovary and colon, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2). These data indicated that elevated expression of Wnt5A regulated the signaling pathway to support MDR cancer cell resistant to chemotherapy.The Wnt pathway is upregulated in drug-resistant cancer cells(A) Western blot analysis of ABCB1, \u03b2-catenin, phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin, GSK3\u03b2, phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2, c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein expression levels in MES-SA, MES-SA/Dx5, MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR2 cells.

Data represent mean \u00b1 S.D. of three independent experiments. *P<0.05 and **P<0.01 indicate differences between the drug-resistant and the parental cells.Upregulation of Wnt5A was controlled by DNA methylation in drug-resistant cell lineIn order to determine whether there was aberrant methylation of Wnt5A, we used COBRA assay to further investigate the CpG island of the first intron of Wnt5A (+494-+664) in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells. The COBRA assay results indicated lower methylation status in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 2A and 2B). To determine whether expression of Wnt5A in MES-SA/Dx5 cells is regulated by DNA methylation of the CpG island in the first intron of Wnt5A (+494-+664), Wnt5A expression was examined in untreated and 2 \u03bcM 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine\u2013treated MES-SA cells. 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine was previously reported to inhibit DNMT1 and reduced DNA hypomethylation in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative RT-PCR data indicated that 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine-treated MES-SA cells, which had lower methylation status, showed 11-fold increase of Wnt5A mRNA expression level (Figure 2C and 2D). These data indicated that aberrant hypomethylation of the Wnt5A intron led to elevated Wnt5A expression levels in MDR cancer cells.Hypomethylation of Wnt5A in drug-resistant cancer cell lines(A) Methylation status was detected by COBRA assay in both MDR cells.

A previous report has indicated that Wnt5A-activated Protein Kinase A pathway leads to \u03b2-catenin accumulation in the nucleus via GSK3\u03b2 inactivation. To verify possible Wnt5A pathway activation resulting in \u03b2-catenin induction, we evaluated the expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit PRKACA, PRKACB and PRKACG in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR data showed that PRKACB expression was significantly increased in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 3A). It has previously been shown that PKA is activated by increasing the transcription of its catalytic subunit \u03b2, PRKACB. These data led us to hypothesize upregulation of cAMP/PKA activities in drug-resistant cells. Previous data indicated that PKA activation was followed by phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding proteins and subsequent CRE activation, leading to expression of CRE-regulated genes. To evaluate the PKA activity, CRE reporter assays were performed and the data indicated that CRE expressed was upregulated in MES-SA/Dx5 and foskolin-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 3B). Furthermore, higher cAMP levels were detected in MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). After treating with increasing dosages of the PKA inhibitor H-89 in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2, TOP reporter assays showed decreased activities (Figure 3C) and western blot analysis showed increases of phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) and GSK3\u03b2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). On the other hand, decreased levels of \u03b2-catenin, phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2 (Ser 9), c-Myc and cyclin D1 were also found in H-89-treated MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). These data indicated that upregulating PKA signaling was detected and the \u03b2-catenin-related signaling was regulated by PKA signaling in MDR cells.Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway is upregulated in two drug-resistant cancer cell lines(A) Real-time RT-PCR analysis of PRKACA, PRKACB and PRKACG mRNA expression in MES-SA, MES-SA/Dx5, MCF7 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.

Data represent mean \u00b1 S.D. of three independent experiments.Wnt5A regulates PKA and \u03b2-catenin activities in the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cell lineTo confirm the regulatory role of Wnt5A on \u03b2-catenin through PKA activity, a Wnt5A shRNA vector was introduced into MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Western blot data indicated that \u03b2-catenin, ABCB1, c-Myc and cyclin D1 were downregulated in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 4A). Likewise, Wnt5A secretion was also decreased in these cells (Figure 4A). Besides, increases in phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) and decreased levels of phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2 (Ser 9) and \u03b2-catenin were also detected Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 4B). Furthermore, CRE and TOP reporter assays indicated that CRE and TOP activities were reduced in MES-SA/Dx5 cells when Wnt5A was knocked down (Figures 4C and 4D). Since decreased cyclin D1 levels were detected, PI staining was employed to examine cell cycle changes in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells, which showed that cells in G1 phase increased 50% to 60% in the Wnt5A knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells relative to control vector transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 4E). Moreover, TUNEL assays showed that doxorubicin-treated Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells were set in the course of apoptosis, and FACS analysis further showed that the apoptotic rate was 0% and 5% in 0.85 \u03bcM and 1.7 \u03bcM doxorubicin-treated control knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells, but apoptosis reached up to 25% and 43% in similarly-treated Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 4F). These data indicated that Wnt5A controlled PKA and \u03b2-catenin signaling in MDR cells.CRE and \u03b2-catenin activities and cell viability are reduced in Wnt5A shRNA-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cell line(A-B) Western bot analysis of expression levels of (A) Wnt5A, \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 and secreted Wnt5A expression levels and (B) \u03b2-catenin, phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin, GSk3,.phosphorylated GSk3\u03b2 in shWnt5A transient transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells.

As data presented in the preceding sections showed that \u03b2-catenin was regulated by Wnt5A in drug-resistant cells, we therefore further evaluated expression levels and functions of ABCB1 in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Data from ABCB1-luciferase reporter assays, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that ABCB1 promoter activities and protein expression levels were reduced in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 5A and B). Calcein AM is a useful dye for quantitative functional analysis of ABCB1; lower fluorescence in Calcein AM-stained cells means higher drug pump-out ability. When the dye was used to monitor the ABCB1 functions in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells, the data showed that the percentage of Calcein AM-stained cell was increased by 40% in the Wnt5A knockdown cells compared with the control cells (Figure 5C).ABCB1 pump-out ability is reduced in Wnt5A shRNA- knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells(A) ABCB1 transactivation activities in ABCB1 promoter-luciferase reporter assays in shWnt5A and shCTNNB1-transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells.

To evaluate these observations in vivo, the tumor size and viability of doxorubicin-treated Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 xenografts were determined. The IVIS luciferase imaging results indicated that 7 or 14 days of doxorubicin treatment led to slower growth in Wnt5A-knockdown tumors when compared with the xenografts of the vector control (Figure 6A and B). When tumors were collected after 21 days of doxorubicin treatment, reduced tumor sizes from the Wnt5A-knockdown groups were observed (Figure. 6C). The tumor sizes of xenografts of Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells were 2-, 3- and 4-fold reduced in the mean relative tumor volume compared to those of the vector control cells at 7, 14 and 21 days of doxorubicin treatment, respectively (Figure. 6D). Furthermore, xenografts of Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells showed reduced expression levels of ABCB1 and VEGF (Figure. 6E). The data demonstrated tumor regression in the Wnt5A-knockdown tumor treated with doxorubicin, suggesting that this Wnt5A-related pathway contributes to MDR tumor progression.In vivo reduction of tumor growth rate of doxorubicin-treated Wnt5A shRNA-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells(A) Tumor formation of biweekly doxorubicin-treated shWnt5A (right) and control (left) vector-transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells that were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice.

Western blot analysis showed that \u03b2-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 of MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner in anti-Wnt5A antibody treatment (Figure 7A). Increased levels of GSK3\u03b2 were also observed in anti-Wnt5A antibody treated-MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 7A). On the other hand, the data revealed that CRE and TOP activities of MES-SA/Dx5 were significantly reduced with anti-Wnt5A antibody in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 7B and 7C). Since lower levels of cyclin D1 were detected, cell cycle progression was further assessed in the anti-Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells, which resulted in a delay in cell cycle progression through G1/S and S/G2. In control antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells, 28.73% of cells were in the G1 phase and 40.61% of cells were in the S phase. In the presence of 0.5 or 1 \u03bcg anti-Wnt5A antibody, 32.74% and 33.61% of cells were in the G1 phase, while 49.34% and 50.87% of cells remained in S phase, respectively (Figure 7D). As decreased \u03b2-catenin expression levels were observed in anti-Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells, and \u03b2-catenin/Tcf is an important transcriptional regulator of ABCB1, the drug efflux ability was next evaluated in the anti-Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells. The data showed that the mean fraction of calcein AM-stained cells was 5.9% in the control antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells, but cell fraction was increased to 7.6% and 19.4% when 0.5 or 1 \u03bcg anti-Wnt5A antibody was applied (Figure 7E). Moreover, MTT assay data revealed that the cell viability was 89.5% and 85.4% in 1 \u03bcg control antibody and 0.85 \u03bcM doxorubicin co-treated MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells, respectively. Specifically, after a combined application of 1 \u03bcg anti-Wnt5A antibody with 0.85 \u03bcM doxorubicin, a further reduction in cell viability of 55.3% and 57.4% was observed in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5, respectively (Figure 7F and 7G). The data demonstrated that the drug pump out ability and cell viability were decreased in Wnt-5A-depleted MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells, further supporting the secretion of Wnt5A to control the PKA/\u03b2-catenin pathway in MDR cells.Antibody depletion of Wnt5A leads to downregulation of PKA/\u03b2-catenin activities and resensitizes doxorubicin toxicity in MES-SA/Dx5 cells(A) Western blot analysis of \u03b2-catenin, phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin, GSK3\u03b2, phosphorylated GSK3\u03b2, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 protein expression levels in Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.

The patients all showed relapses after chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 1). Paired pre- and post-treatment samples (after one or several cycles of chemotherapy) were compared for Wnt5A and ABCB1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry staining (Supplementary Figure 4). Among the relapsed patients, 19 of the 24 (79%, P<0.001) of the biopsied samples showed significant increases of Wnt5A expression (Figures 8A, 8D & 8G), and 21/24 (88%, P<0.001) of the tumor biopsies also showed a significant upregulated ABCB1 expression after chemotherapy (Figures 8B, 8E & 8H). Furthermore, 18/24 (75%) of the samples showed significantly paired increases of Wnt5A and ABCB1 expression after chemotherapy. Only three tumor biopsies showed increased ABCB1 expression without concurrent increases in Wnt5A after chemotherapy. These data indicated high correlation between Wnt5A and ABCB1 in the clinical samples. Prompted by the observation of angiogenesis in the MES-SA/Dx5 xenograft model described above, the expression levels of VEGF were further investigated in the tumor biopsies from the relapsed patients. The data showed that among the 24 relapsed patients, 21 (88%, P<0.001) samples showed significant increases in VEGF expression (Figures 8C, 8F & 8I). Furthermore, 19/24 (79%) of the patient samples showed significantly paired increases of VEGF and ABCB1 expression after chemotherapy. Moreover, 17/24 (71%, P<0.001) of the samples showed significantly concurrent increases of VEGF and Wnt5A expression after chemotherapy. These data indicated positive correlation between Wnt5A, ABCB1 and VEGF in relapsed tumors, concurring with the observation of angiogenesis of the drug-resistant cell line xenograft model. Taken together, the relapsed tumors showed significant increases of Wnt5A or ABCB1 expression after chemotherapy. In spite of the relative small number of paired breast tumor samples analyzed, the results supports that Wnt5A activation is involved in chemoresistance of breast cancer, consistent of the in vitro data.Expression of Wnt5A, ABCB1 and VEGF is associated with clinical chemoresistance in breast cancer patientsImmunohistochemical analysis of expression of (A) Wnt5A, (B) ABCB1 and (C) VEGF in a clinical cohort of patient matched-tumour specimens from PS-B, primary surgery, breast (naive to chemotherapy) and SCR, secondary surgery (after tumour has recurred and after chemotherapy) breast cancer tumor biopsies of relapsed patients.

Enhancing \u03b2-catenin signaling by treatment with GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors in the brain vasculature endothelial cells leads to elevated ABCB1 expression. The Wnt receptor, Fzd1, was upregulated in a doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cell line, and Fzd1-slienced drug-resistant cells had reduced ABCB1 expression levels and were sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment. Colon cancer patients with mutant \u03b2-catenin had higher ABCB1 expression, and Wnt signaling was activated in a chemotherapy-resistant side-population (SP) of colon cancer cells. Human ABCB1 expression level was monitored by several transcription factors including AP-1, EGR1, C/EBP, NF-\u03baB and TCF4/\u03b2-catenin. A number of TCF4/\u03b2-catenin binding sites are found on the ABCB1 promoter which indicates that Wnt pathway-related proteins are dominant transcription factors in ABCB1 expression. Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin sensitized the cells to paclitaxel and irinotecan in colon cancer SP cells and 5-FU in 5-FU-resistant cholangiocarcinoma. ABCB1, which is known to be responsible for drug resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), decreases in expression levels after treating with \u03b2-catenin and Wnt1 shRNA. Furthermore, induced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signals by several proteins lead to increased ABCB1 expression level and promote drug resistance in different cancer cells such as the PITX2 protein in renal cancer cell lines and retinoic acid receptor gamma in cholangiocarcinoma. These evidences support the observation presented in this work on upregulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells. Our data indicated that the \u03b2-catenin-related pathway was upregulated in the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.Role of the Wnt5A pathway in drug-resistance cancerIn a previous study, evidences indicated correlation between Wnt5A and cancer drug resistance. Upregulation of Wnt5A was found in oxaliplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line. Ovarian cancer that overexpressed Wnt5A also showed lower chemosensitivity to paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and etoposide. Furthermore, Wnt5A and its receptor, ROR2, were found to upregulate AKT/PKB survival signaling in histone deacetylase inhibitor-resistant colon cancer. Wnt5A and NFATc2 were also upregulated in expression in pancreatic cancer; inhibition of Wnt5A led to significant increases in drug induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, higher Wnt5A expression observed in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells resulted in \u03b2-catenin activation by a noncanonical PKA pathway. Based on these evidences, Wnt5A is an important signal protein associated with drug-resistance in cancer.Relationship between the PKA pathway in drug-resistant cancerType 1 cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A-related pathway is one of the pathways that modulates ABCB1 expression in multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells. Selective PKA inhibitors were options to inhibit survival of drug-resistant cancer cells. Abnormal activation of PKA increases DNA repair in cells which in turn results in resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, activation of PKA leads to conversion of ER alpha inhibitor, tamoxifen, into a growth stimulator in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Hence, tamoxifen might become beneficial to breast cancer patients who have lower levels of PKA and ER alpha S305-P. Elevated PKA signals were also observed in trastuzumab resistance in Her2-positive breast cancer. PKA- and NF-kappa B-related signals are upregulated in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells and a combined regime of inhibitors of PKA and NF-kappa B with docetaxel significantly induces apoptosis in castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, PKA-related genes are reported to be associated with MEK inhibitor resistance in colorectal cancer and 20-30% non-small cell lung cancer. In this work, we observed that PKA regulated the \u03b2-catenin pathway in MDR cancer cells. Our data support the notion that PKA plays an important role in drug resistance.Methylation induced by doxorubicin in MDR cellsIn our research, hypomethylation of the Wnt5A intron was found in drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells and this methylation site regulated Wnt5A expression level in both cells. Based on the reported results, DNA methylation inhibitors, hydralazine and magnesium valproate, were combined with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide used in the clinical breast cancer patients. In addition, the global epigenetic changes played an important role in acquired drug-resistant phenotype of MCF7 drug resistance cells. On the other hand, previous study indicated that DNA methylation status was affluence by chemotherapy drug in cancer cell and alternation of DNA methylation pattern led to gene expression level change such as ABCB1 was hypermethylated in MCF7 compared to MCF7/ADR2 cell. Hypomethylation genes, such as ABCB1, GSTpi, MGMT, Upa and TGM2 had lower methylation ability in MCF-7 doxorubicin-resistant cells and hypomethylation of ABCB1 led to higher ABCB1 expression. Demethylation of ABCG2 was observed and negatively associated with ABCG2 protein expression in mitoxantrone-resistant multiple myeloma cells. Our finding provided another evidences that upregulation of Wnt5A controlled by DNA hypomethylation led to increases in the expression levels of \u03b2-catenin-regulated genes in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.Correlation and clinical outcomes of Wnt5A and ABCB1 in clinical chemoresistance in breast cancer patientsOverexpression of ABCB1 in tumor tissues of cancer patients following chemotherapy is well established. On the other hand, expression of FZD1 is highly correlated to ABCB1 expression level. Since there are only limited number of ABCB1 inhibitors currently available, continued searches for activated molecular targets in chemoresistant cancer are crucial for the development of novel strategies for treating chemoresistant patients. Towards this goal, expression of Wnt5A and ABCB1 in biopsies from 24 pre-and post-chemotherapeutic-treated breast cancer patients were analyzed. The cohort included 24 patients with relapses most likely due to chemoresistance. Enhanced Wnt5A was detected in the tumour biopsies, and significantly elevated Wnt5A and/or ABCB1 expression was shown in biopsied samples after chemotherapy (Figures 8A & 8B). It is anticipated that a more extensive cohort of patients would confirm our observations, which are highly consistent with the in vitro data that Wnt5A and ABCB1 are both involved in chemoresistance and cell survival.Relationship between VEGF, Wnt5A and ABCB1 in multidrug-resistant cancer cells: a proposed mechanismHigher expression levels of both secreted Wnt5A and secreted VEGF in multidrug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5, KB-V1, NCI/ADR-RES and SW620-MDR1 cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Furthermore, In the Wnt5A-knockdown xenograft model, decreased angiogenesis and reduced VEGF and ABCB1 expression levels were observed (Figure 6E). VEGF and ABCB1 are both \u03b2-catenin-targeted genes. In the previous study, increased Wnt5A, \u03b2-catenin and VEGF-A were found in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and Wnt5A expression was correlated to expression of VEGF, Ki67, androgen receptor in prostate cancer. Despite the need to clarify the relationship between ABCB1 and VEGF, upregulation of VEGF-A and VEGF-B was found in NSCLC side population (SP) cells, accompanied by overexpression of ABCG2 and ABCB1 mRNAs. Besides, ABCB1 and VEGF enhanced the invasion properties of MDR cells. These are evidences to indicate that VEGF-related signaling is upregulated in MDR cancer cells. Based on our observation, VEGF inhibitor may be an option for inhibiting MDR cells.A model of Wnt5A/PKA/\u03b2-catenin activation in the development of drug resistance in cancer cellsIn the model, hypomethylation of Wnt5A probably leads to upregulated expression of Wnt5A in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Subsequently, Wnt5A activates PKA and PKA phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3\u03b2 leading to activation of \u03b2-catenin and \u03b2-catenin-targeted genes including ABCB1, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. The upregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc led to increase cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells under chemotherapy treatment. The proposed model, based on experimental evidences presented here, suggests that Wnt5A-mediated activation of downstream signal transducers is an important mechanism in the development of drug resistance in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells.CONCLUSIONSThis study presented results on the involvement of Wnt5A and the subsequent activation of the non-canonical PKA/\u03b2-catenin pathway in chemoresistance in two drug-resistant cell lines and in biopsied samples from breast cancer patients. Interestingly, VEGF upregulation was found in MDR cancers. These observations are useful for searching for novel therapeutic targets in chemoresistant patients.MATERIAL AND METHODSCell cultureThe multiple drug-resistant cell line MES-SA/Dx5-C5 (CRL-1977; ATCC, Manassas, VA) was established from the human sarcoma cell line MES-SA (CRL-1976; ATCC) in the presence of increasing doxorubicin concentrations.

After 48 h of incubation,cell viability was determined in MTT assays.Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA)Genomic DNAs extraction and bisulfite conversion were performed as described previously. Briefly, for the amplification of the human Wnt5A intron I, PCR was performed using 10 ng of the bisulfite-converted genomic DNA as a template. The primer sets of COBRA-PCR were listed as follows: The Wnt 5A COBRA 1 F sequence was 5\u2032-TGTTTGAGTTTATTTAGTGG-3\u2032. The Wnt 5A COBRA 1R sequence was 5\u2032-AAAAAAACTAAAAACCAACTACTCC-3\u2032. Purified PCR products were then digested with 10 U of Hha I (New England Biolabs) at 37\u00b0C. The quantification criterion of COBRA was as previously published.Quantitative real-time RT-PCRThe RT-PCR was performed as previously described. Brief, total RNA (2 \u03bcg) was prepared from the transfectants and was treated with DNase I. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNAs at 42 oC for 60 min using Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). After the oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription reaction, real-time PCR was performed in a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in 96-well plates. The reaction mixture was 1 \u03bcl RT product, 15 \u03bcl RealQ-PCR Master Mix Kit (Ampliqon AqS, Denmark), 1 \u03bcl each of 10 \u03bcM forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 2), and the total volume was adjusted to 10 \u03bcl with nuclease-free water. The real-time PCR program was: pre-incubation at 50 oC for 2 min, initial denaturation at 95 oC for 7 min, and 45 cycles at 95 oC for 10 s, 60 oC for 15 s and 72 oC for 30 s. The program was terminated by a final extension at 60 oC for 1 min and cooling at 40 oC for 5 min. For normalization, the mRNA level of the \u03b2-actin gene in each RNA preparation was determined. Relative gene expression was determined by the \u0394\u0394Ct method, where Ct=threshold cycle. The relative targeted mRNA levels were normalized to the mRNA level of the reference \u03b2-actin gene. The melting curve of the amplification product was always checked to ensure a single clean peak that represented good-quality real-time PCR data.Cell viability MTT assayCells were plated at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. The cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of various drugs or transfected with the indicated plasmid. After 48 h of incubation, the medium was removed and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to wash the cells. Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) (200 \u03bcl) was added to each well and was incubated with the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. Subsequence, 400 \u03bcl DMSO was added to each well and incubation at 37 \u00b0C was continued for 20 min. Absorbance of the mixture was read at 540 nm using a Microplate Reader (VersaMax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Cell viability (%) was calculated as the fraction of the surviving cells in each drug-treated experiment set to that of the control.Cell cycle analysis by FLOW cytometryCells were plated at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid or treated with the indicated antibody for 48 h. The cells were then harvested and fixed with 1 ml of 70% ice-cold ethanol. The fixed cells were pelleted and suspended in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 and RNAse A at 10 \u03bcg/ml) (Sigma-A) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were stained with 50 \u03bcg/ml propidium iodine (Chemicon). After 20 min of incubation at 4 \u00b0C in the dark, the cells were analyzed using a FCM scan flow cytometer using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells in the apoptotic sub-G1 and G1, S-phase and G2-M phase were calculated using the Modfit software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).TUNEL assay of cell deathCell cultures were fixed and detection of DNA-strand breaks was performed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL) method using the Apo-BrdU In Situ DNA Fragmentation Assay Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as previous reported. TUNEL staining-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry using Cellquest Pro FACS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).Calcein-acetoxymethyl ester assays for ABCB1 functionsA calcein acetoxymethylester (calcein AM) assay was performed using the MultiDrugQuantTM Assay kit (CHEMICON). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 1\u00d7105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid for 48 h. Calcein-AM was added at 25 nM into each well and the cells were incubated for 20 min before being trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min and pelleted. Supernatant was removed after centrifugation at 800 g. One ml medium was used to resuspend the cell pellet for FLOW cytometry analysis using Cellquest Pro FACS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Distribution of the green-fluorescent protein calcein in the cells was observed by FLOW cytometry. The percentage relative fluorescence (RFL) in the cells was expressed as: % FL = [(FL treatment - FL nontreatment)/FL nontreatment] \u00d7 100%.Tumor xenografts in nude miceEight week-old male nude mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). All experimental procedures involving the use of animals for experimental purposes were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Chang Gung University under the protocol number CGU11-113. The mice were maintained in an air-conditioned animal facility under constant temperature and humidity conditions with a 12:12 light-dark cycle and the mice were allowed ad libitum in the diet or drinking water. Mice were randomly picked to different groups and each group had 5 or more mice. Wnt5A shRNA or control scramble shRNA-transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells (1\u00d7106) was mixed with Matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) followed by subcutaneous injection into the dorsal region near the thigh of the mice. Upon 1 month of tumor establishment, mice were intraperitoneally injected with the indicated concentrations of doxorubicin or PBS. The tumor volume and IVIS image were obtained on day 0, 7 and 14 after doxorubicin treatment. The tumor volume (V) was measured by a vernier scale every 7 days up to 3 weeks, and calculated as V (mm3)=(L\u00d7W2)/2, where L was the largest diameter and W was the diameter perpendicular to L. On day 21 of doxorubicin treatment, all mice were sacrificed and tumors were resected, weighed and frozen or fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded for immunohistochemical studies.Bioluminescent IVIS imaging SystemXenografted nude mice were kept in a chamber and were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane/oxygen mixture and intraperitoneally injected with 20 mg/ml D-luciferin (Promega) in PBS (200 mg/kg). Mice were sedated using isoflurane, and live anesthetized mice were imaged using the Bioluminescent IVIS Imaging system (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA). The resulting light emission was quantified using the Living Image software (Xenogen). Raw values were reported as photons/second/cm2/sr.Breast cancer patients and immunohistochemical staining studiesThe 24 tumor paired tumor tissue biopsied samples for immunohistochemical analyses were obtained from breast cancer patients at diagnosis and after treatment from 1995 to 2014 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH)-Linkou Medical Center. Tumor materials were collected after informed consent and with approval from Institutional Review Board of CGMH (IRB:101-4592B). All patients received surgery and treatment according to international protocols, including doxorubicin-based chemotherapy. Biopsies of paired cancer samples were obtained from the patients immediately after surgery at diagnosis, and after at least one course of chemotherapy. Immunostaining was performed with anti-ABCB1, anti-VEGF and anti-Wnt5A antibodies (Santa Cruz) using the Dako-REAL, Alkaline-Phosphatase/RED detection system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Hematoxylin was used for counterstaining according to the manufacturer's protocol. The staining intensity of each malignant tissue was evaluated and scored by pathologists. The Wnt5A, ABCB1 and VEGF-A staining was scored for a tumor using an H-score that had been obtained by multiplying the staining intensity (graded as 0, negative; 1+, weak; 2+, moderate; and 3+, strong) (see Supplementary Figure 3) by the percentage of tumor cells with positive cytoplasmic staining (0% to 100%). H-score to verify the IHC results was as described previously.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). The surviving fraction and the relative luminescence unit (RLU) were measured in triplicate samples and were expressed as mean \u00b1 S.D. The Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. Immunohostochemical results (staining intensity \u00d7 percentage) of Wnt5A, ABCB1 and VEGF immunoreactivity in human breast cancer biopsies were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL, FIGURES AND TABLESConflicts of interestsThe authors declare no conflicts of interests.REFERENCESP-glycoprotein inhibition as

        "title": "WNT5A as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.",
        "content": "Despite the clinical development of novel adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic drugs, metastatic breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death among women. The present review focuses on the relevance, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential of targeting WNT5A as a future anti-metastatic treatment strategy for breast cancer patients by restoring WNT5A signaling as an innovative therapeutic option. WNT5A is an auto- and paracrine \u03b2-catenin-independent ligand that has been shown to induce tumor suppression as well as oncogenic signaling, depending upon cancer type. In breast cancer patients, WNT5A protein expression has been observed to be significantly reduced in between 45 and 75% of the cases and associated with early relapse and reduced disease-free survival.

The present review focuses on the relevance, mechanisms, and therapeutic potential of targeting WNT5A as a future anti-metastatic treatment strategy for breast cancer patients by restoring WNT5A signaling as an innovative therapeutic option. WNT5A is an auto- and paracrine \u03b2-catenin-independent ligand that has been shown to induce tumor suppression as well as oncogenic signaling, depending upon cancer type. In breast cancer patients, WNT5A protein expression has been observed to be significantly reduced in between 45 and 75% of the cases and associated with early relapse and reduced disease-free survival. WNT5A triggers various downstream signaling pathways in breast cancer that primarily affect tumor cell migration and invasion. The accumulated in vitro results reveal that treatment of WNT5A-negative breast cancer cells with recombinant WNT5A caused different tumor-suppressive responses and in particular it impaired migration and invasion.

In humans, the WNT family consists of 19 highly conserved lipid-modified secreted glycoproteins that exert their effect by interacting with different receptors/co-receptors including frizzled receptors (FZD), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins (LRP5/6), receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor family (ROR), and the related receptor tyrosine kinase (RYK). The majority of WNT proteins vary in size between 38 and 43\u00a0kDa, they contain up to 22 conserved cysteine residues, and are significantly glycosylated and lipid modified. WNT proteins are hydrophobic in nature and mostly tethered to cell membranes and the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, apart from being hydrophobic, the WNT5A molecule has a heparin sulfate-binding domain that promotes its binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). These properties of secreted glycosylated lipid-modified WNT proteins limit their ability to diffuse freely through the extracellular aqueous microenvironment. Instead, WNT-expressing cells secrete WNT proteins in the extracellular environment to form concentration gradients to which the secreting cell or its neighboring cells, expressing the cognate receptors, respond in a concentration-dependent auto- or paracrine manner.WNT proteins have been classified on the basis of their ability to morphologically change and alter the growth pattern of C57MG mammary epithelial cells. Highly transforming WNT1, WNT2, WNT3, and WNT3A elicit strong morphological alterations; moderately transforming WNT6 and WNT7A induces weak morphological changes; and WNT4, WNT5A, WNT5B, and WNT7B are unable to induce any morphological changes in C57MG cells, highlighting the divergent roles of different WNT proteins, despite their structural similarity. WNT proteins have also been grouped as classical WNTs (WNT1, WNT3A, WNT8, and WNT8B) that activate the \u03b2-catenin-dependent (canonical) pathway and non-classical WNTs (WNT4, WNT5A, WNT11) that induce \u03b2-catenin-independent (non-canonical) pathways. The \u03b2-catenin-dependent pathway is initiated by the binding of WNT to the membrane-bound FZD receptors and co-receptor LRP5 or 6 that antagonizes the activity of the destruction complex consequently stabilizing the \u03b2-catenin that then bind to specific transcription factors (i.e., T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor TCF/LEF) and induce transcription of WNT-responsive genes. Some members of the WNT family, such as WNT5A, signal via alternative, \u03b2-catenin-independent mechanisms, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (WNT/Ca2+) and the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways that antagonize \u03b2-catenin-dependent signaling. The focus of this review will be on the \u03b2-catenin-independent ligand WNT5A. WNT5A is one of the extensively studied members of the WNT gene family. WNT5A functions as a morphogen in a variety of tissues and regulates various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, during early embryonic developmental stages. WNT5A\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit several developmental defects, such as dwarfism; shortened limbs and tails; lungs with foreshortened trachea; facial, ear, and genital abnormalities; and ventricular septal defects. These mice die shortly after birth. WNT5A is also involved in mammary gland development and inhibition of ductal extension and branching in the mammary gland.The human WNT5A gene was mapped to chromosome 3p14-p21. The gene consists of five exons, with the last exon spanning a 3\u2032-untranslated region of approximately 6.5 kilobase pairs containing multiple polyadenylation sites. The WNT5A gene has been shown to encode two different transcripts, a long WNT5A-L isoform, and a short WNT5A-S isoform. These two distinct mRNAs have different translational start sites due to different upstream promoter sequences. In breast cancer, WNT5A-S mRNA expression was elevated, while WNT5A-L mRNA was decreased, thereby suggesting that if these different mRNA isoforms are translated to different WNT5A isoforms that they might have distinct biochemical functions. However, so far, such a possibility has not been demonstrated at the protein level nor has it been addressed in vivo. Additionally, the WNT5A transcript contains several AU-rich sequences in its 3\u2032-untranslated region, highlighting the importance of several RNA binding proteins as its potential regulators. In breast cancer, WNT5A has been shown to be regulated at the post-transcriptional level via HuR, a member of embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like protein family that binds to evolutionary conserved AU-rich motifs in the untranslated region of its mRNA and suppresses translation. The mature human WNT5A protein shares >\u200999% homology to mouse and >\u200993% to other WNT5A proteins reported in other species.Previous studies have demonstrated that ectopic treatment with commercially available full-length recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A) can elucidate both an oncogenic and a tumor-suppressive role of WNT5A depending on the cancer type. These findings suggest that the interaction between WNT5A and its receptors determine the type of downstream outcome in different types of cancer. Loss of WNT5A has been associated with poor prognosis in a number of different cancer types such as breast cancer, colon cancer, neuroblastoma, and leukemia, thus suggesting a tumor-suppressive function of WNT5A in these tumor subtypes. In the present review, we will discuss how WNT5A has emerged as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, and how re-activating its signaling pathway in breast cancer cells can be an attractive alternative to curb this dreaded disease.WNT5A expression in breast cancerWNT5A expression has been studied in human breast cancer tissue by various investigators at both the transcriptional and protein level. However, it should be noted that WNT5A mRNA levels have been documented not to correlate to the WNT5A protein levels in breast cancer tissue, since the translation of WNT5A mRNA can be regulated via its untranslated 3\u2032-region, thereby generating discrepancies between WNT5A mRNA levels and protein expression. A similar discrepancy between WNT5A mRNA and protein levels has also been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence, it can be misleading to draw conclusions based on correlations between WNT5A mRNA and clinicopathological parameters or clinical response. Hence, we have opted not to discuss those mRNA-based studies in the current review to minimize confusion.The first immunohistochemical study on WNT5A was performed on 96 patients with primary invasive ductal carcinoma (IDCs) using a specific anti-WNT5A antibody. Approximately, 45% of these IDCs showed loss or low expression of the WNT5A protein that was associated with an absence of estrogen, as well as progesterone receptors and increasing histological grade. Additionally, 83 patients (with longer follow-up) were further incorporated in the same study to investigate the prognostic significance of WNT5A protein expression. The authors reported loss of or reduced WNT5A protein expression in 78% of patients with recurrence but only in 35% of those without recurrence. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with no or reduced WNT5A protein expression. Another independent investigation revealed loss of or reduced WNT5A protein expression in the tumor tissue from 56% of the included breast cancer patients. These authors also reported that the presence of WNT5A protein was associated with longer disease survival, while in univariate analyzes, the WNT5A negative group indicated an increased risk of mortality. Additionally, the WNT5A levels in the tumor samples did not correlate with proliferation markers or phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RB), indicating that the WNT5A protein is not involved in the proliferation of breast cancer. Using specific probes for detecting WNT5A mRNA (no cross-reactivity with WNT5B), the authors also showed that tumors (n\u2009=\u200920) expressing significant levels of WNT5A mRNA had no expression of the WNT5A protein, indicating for the first time that WNT5A protein expression could be regulated at the translational level. One such translational mechanism was revealed by Leandersson and co-workers, who demonstrated that the ELAV-like protein HuR can inhibit WNT5A mRNA translation by binding to its conserved AU-rich sequences in 3\u0384-UTR regions present in the WNT5A transcript.Later, the loss of WNT5A expression in 146 tumors (40%) in a pre-menopausal cohort of 361 samples with a median follow-up time of 14\u00a0years was reported. WNT5A emerged as an independent prognostic marker in estrogen receptor-positive tumors and was associated with good prognosis in Luminal A tumors. Furthermore, reduced WNT5A expression significantly correlated with young age, estrogen receptor negativity, and the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) phenotype. Several other researchers also demonstrated a similar loss of WNT5A protein in TNBC patients by immunohistochemical staining. Borcherding and co-workers showed loss of WNT5A protein in 75% of TNBC patients. Similarly, other investigators have recently demonstrated that decreased expression of WNT5A is a prognostic factor in TNBC patients by showing that patients with reduced expression of WNT5A in their tumor tissue have poor recurrence-free survival. Additionally, it has been shown that early breast tumors and pre-neoplastic lesions express WNT5A protein that decreases in late-stage tumors and lung metastases. Overall, studies of WNT5A protein expression in breast cancer tissue reveal that it functions as a tumor suppressor in this type of cancer, where its loss correlates with breast cancer progression and metastasis. As a ligand, WNT5A triggers various signaling cascades by binding to its cognate receptors or receptor/co-receptor complexes. Thus, in order to understand the mechanism whereby reduced expression of the WNT5A protein leads to breast cancer progression, one has to understand how WNT5A signaling affects breast cancer cell behavior.WNT5A signaling regulates breast cancer cell migration and invasionThe metastatic spread of breast cancer cells is a sequential series of events involving reduced cell-cell and cell-basement membrane interactions, increased tumor cell migration, and invasion through the basement membrane and entrance into the circulation via lymph and/or blood vessels to finally reach distant organ sites where the tumor cells can invade and proliferate and give rise to a metastatic foci. WNT5A has been shown to control various signaling pathways involved in the regulation of breast cancer cell migration and invasion and thus, the metastatic process. In the present section, we will discuss WNT5A signaling and how it can affect the functional responses of breast cancer cells with a focus on their migration and invasion.Initial findings on WNT5A suggested that its mRNA expression in human mammary epithelial HB2 cells could be regulated by cell shape, confluence, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). At confluence, WNT5A was upregulated by 30-fold; however, its expression decreased by 3-fold when cells were transferred from a two-dimensional surface (flat cell morphology) to three-dimensional gels (spherical shape morphology). These findings suggest that WNT5A upregulation upon cell confluence might inhibit cell migration. However, it should be pointed out that these findings were not explored and confirmed in relation to WNT5A protein expression. Using immortalized mammary epithelial cells (HB2), it was demonstrated that overexpression of WNT5A increased binding of mammary epithelial cells to collagen and obliterated HGF triggered migration. In contrast, downregulation of WNT5A in these cells resulted in cell scattering, deregulated cell-collagen interaction, and increased cell migration. The authors further demonstrated that downregulation of WNT5A impairs both cell-to-collagen binding and collagen-induced discoidin domain receptor-1 (DDR1) phosphorylation, suggesting a direct relationship between WNT5A-dependent DDR1-phosphorylation and breast cancer cell adhesion to the collagen matrix. Subsequently, it was shown that the WNT5A-induced increase in DDR1 phosphorylation/activation in mammary epithelial HB2 cell adhesion is mediated via activation of the heterotrimeric Gi/o protein, as revealed by pertussis toxin experiments. Based on these findings, mastoparan was used to directly activate heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins in WNT5A-negative breast cancer cells, resulting in reconstitution of collagen to induce phosphorylation of DDR1 and an increased adhesiveness of these breast cancer cells, thereby proposing the therapeutic notion to use mastoparan to reinstall WNT5A signaling in WNT5A-negative breast cancer. As the expression of WNT5A protein predicts longer disease-free survival in breast cancer patients, its metastasis-suppressing activity might at least in part be due to increased DDR1-dependent cell adhesion and decreased migration. Another important mechanism that could contribute to the anti-invasive property of WNT5A signaling in breast cancer is the activation status of the transcription factor nuclear factor associated with T cells (NFAT). The activity of this transcription factor has been shown to directly correlate with breast cancer migration and invasion. Interestingly, WNT5A has been shown to induce Yes/Cdc42/CK1\u03b1 signaling that counteracts NFAT activity.Interestingly, observations made during studies of mammary gland development lend interesting clues to the situation in breast cancer. It was demonstrated that WNT5A is essential for transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) to impair mammary branching during mammary gland development. Pellets of TGF-\u03b2 placed in front of the end bud inhibited ductal extension together with decreased end bud size; however, the WNT5A\u2212/\u2212 epithelium was unaffected by the inhibitory effects of TGF-\u03b2. Also in this developmental context, DDR1 phosphorylation was a downstream target of WNT5A signaling. The described link between TGF-\u03b2 and WNT5A was later pursued in a separate study, where the authors showed that loss of TGF-\u03b2 or WNT5A led to nuclear localization and activation of \u03b2-catenin and its target genes, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 and WNT5A antagonize WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling. This finding is interesting, since activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays a crucial role in breast cancer progression and metastasis .In normal breast cells, the majority of \u03b2-catenin protein is present on the membrane in the cadherin-catenin complex and maintains cell-cell adhesion. During cancer progression, there is a loss of cell-cell adhesion. In human breast epithelial cells, the WNT5A-CKI\u03b1 signaling axis has been shown to promote \u03b2-catenin/E-cadherin complex formation. However, in breast cancer, loss of WNT5A expression and signaling was associated with a reduced level of membranous \u03b2-catenin, suggesting that decreased cell-cell adhesion and increased migration contribute to metastatic disease. Apart from its role in cell-cell adhesion, WNT5A signaling also induced the phosphorylation of Thr34 on the dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 KDa (DARPP-32). Interestingly, the WNT5A triggered phosphorylation of DRAPP-32 was shown to impair MCF7 breast cancer cell migration. The investigators delineated a specific WNT5A signaling axis, i.e., FZD3/G\u03b1s/cAMP/PKA, to be responsible for the DARPP-32 and CREB-dependent anti-migratory effects in breast cancer cells. A distinct role for the small GTPase Cdc42 in WNT5A signaling in breast cancer cells has been demonstrated. Somewhat surprisingly, it was shown that WNT5A signaling impairs breast cancer migration via activation of Cdc42. However, the authors demonstrated that WNT5A-triggered Cdc42 activation inhibits ERK1/2-MMP-9 signaling, resulting in impaired breast cancer migration and invasion. CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is associated with breast cancer metastasis. It has been shown that WNT5A signaling alters CD44 splicing, resulting in reduced levels of specific variant isoforms, e.g., CD44v4 and CD44v6, in WNT5A-expressing cells. Later, in an independent study, it was shown that WNT5A signaling impairs CD44-AKT signaling, leading to impaired breast cancer cell migration and invasion. CD44 has also been connected to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, which is interesting since EMT has been related to increased migration and invasion of cancer cells. However, it has been shown that the ability of WNT5A signaling to impair breast cancer cell migration and invasion is not related to a reversal of the EMT status of these cancer cells, thus defining the action of WNT5A as an EMT-independent mechanism.To this point, we have only discussed the role of tumor cell-derived WNT5A; however, there is a very interesting study revealing a role of paracrine WNT5A signaling leading to a reduced number of tumor-initiating cells (TIC). Using transcript profiling, the authors of this study demonstrated that tumors derived from basal and luminal TIC showed preferential loss of WNT5A. In addition, overexpression of WNT5A triggered a feed-forward loop to activate SMAD2, via RYK and the transforming growth factor \u03b2-receptor 1 (TGF\u03b2R1), resulting in limited expansion of basal TICs, hence providing another possible but not proven explanation for the tumor-suppressive effects of WNT5A in breast cancer.Apart from migration and invasion, there are reports of the anti-proliferative effect of WNT5A. In a recent study, WNT5A has been shown to repress ribosomal DNA transcription, implying that WNT5A signaling can target RNA synthesis. Using breast cancer cells, the authors demonstrated that WNT5A signaling through segment polarity protein dishevelled homolog (DVL1) represses ribosomal DNA gene transcription and generates a chromatic state resulting in less transcription of rDNA by RNA polymerase I.Considering all these reports, it is certain that WNT5A signaling exerts tumor-suppressive effects in breast cancer. Ectopic expression of WNT5A protein suppresses breast cancer progression by increasing adhesion with concomitant decrease in cell migration and invasion. Whether and to what extent WNT5A signaling also affects breast cancer cell proliferation, as suggested above, needs further investigation. However, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that may lead to mixed responses to WNT5A signaling in different breast cancer studies. We believe that the effect on \u03b2-catenin signaling is a major deciding factor that governs the WNT5A response in breast cancer cells. Therefore, before using any breast cancer cell line model or clinical cohort, investigators should check for the endogenously present WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. For example, the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is hyperactive in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, whereas it is only moderately active in MCF7 breast cancer cells.WNT5A signaling and how it mediates tumor-suppressive effects in breast cancer cells. Schematic outlining of how WNT5A, via binding to different cognate receptors (e.g., RYK, FZD), mediates downstream signaling cascades and how these affect proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer cells. The red up-arrow symbol refers to upregulation or activation of the indicated proteins, whereas the black down-arrow symbol refers to downregulation or inactivation of the indicated signaling molecules. The blue horizontal arrow refers to activation of a signaling molecule, whereas the blue broken arrow indicates undefined signaling mechanisms. Finally, the red stop symbol indicates inhibition of proliferation or migration/invasionIt has been established that WNT5A expression in breast cancer tissue predicts a prolonged disease-free survival, whereas absence or low expression of WNT5A in breast cancer tissue is associated with a shorter disease-free survival. However, when it comes to WNT5A expression in tumor-associated macrophages residing in breast cancer tissue and how it relates to prognosis, very little, if any, information is available. Furthermore, there is an unclear picture with regard to the functional relevance of macrophage-derived WNT5A in cancer. Pukrop and co-workers have suggested that macrophage-derived WNT5A is the cause of macrophage-induced invasiveness of breast cancer cells. However, for these experiments, the authors have used a non-invasive luminal breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) that normally has an endogenous WNT5A expression. Moreover, in the same study, these authors observed WNT5A-positive macrophages in 7 out of 17 primary tumor samples. In samples with WNT5A-positive macrophages, such cells only constituted 5\u201315% of the total number of macrophages in the tumor tissue. In light of the above findings, we postulate that the contribution of macrophage-derived WNT5A might be negligible if WNT5A is expressed in the breast cancer cells. Although from a different cancer type, the finding that macrophage-derived WNT5A causes regression of basal cell carcinoma either indicates a complex action of macrophage-derived WNT5A and/or that our knowledge is limited regarding its functional effect(s). In another study by Yiu and co-workers, it was demonstrated that NFAT promotes invasive migration through Glypican 6 (GPC6). GPC6 was suggested to regulate invasive migration by inhibiting WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling and upregulating the WNT5A/JNK/p38 pathway. However, a major drawback of the study was the use of a WNT5A/WNT5B antibody for the detection of the WNT5A protein. This WNT5A/WNT5B antibody detects endogenous levels of both WNT5A and WNT5B proteins. In another study, Zhu et al. demonstrated that short-term stimulation with rWNT5A increases breast cancer cell migration via the Dvl2/Daam1/RhoA signaling axis. WNT5A exposure can trigger an early and transient increase in ERK1/2 activity that might lead to an initial but time-limited increase in cancer cell migration, as shown by Prasad et al.. We believe that in the context of breast cancer progression, prolonged exposure of WNT5A is a more relevant physiological approach. A schematic diagram (Fig.\u00a01) shows the most important WNT5A-triggered signaling pathways believed to participate in the regulation of breast cancer cell migration and invasion.WNT5A signaling and breast cancer metabolism: new insightThe oncogenic signaling that occurs in tumor cells often result in altered cellular metabolism, known as the Warburg effect, resulting in aerobic glycolysis irrespective of the presence of oxygen. Furthermore, the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and obesity, which highlights its importance in metabolism and energy expenditure. Although WNT signaling regulates liver metabolism and can stimulate aerobic glycolysis by mTORC2-AKT signaling during osteoblast differentiation, the direct role of WNT5A in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer is still under-investigated. Recently, \u03b2-catenin-dependent and \u03b2-catenin-independent WNT signaling have been associated with metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. In breast cancer cells, WNT/Snail signaling induces a glycolytic switch and represses oxidative phosphorylation and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Using two metastatic breast cancer cell lines, i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, Prasad et al. demonstrated that WNT5A signaling inhibits lactate secretion, thereby impairing breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Detailed investigation of WNT5A signaling revealed downregulation of the \u03b2-catenin-phosphofructokinase-platelet type (PFKP) axis, thereby directly affecting lactate production and migration of breast cancer cells. The authors further established that WNT5A signaling also inhibits monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression, thereby inhibiting lactate uptake in breast cancer cells. These findings were contrary to previous findings in melanoma in which WNT5A acts as a tumor promoter. WNT5A-treated melanoma cells demonstrated an increase in glycolytic activity with concomitant upregulation in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, the AKT/mTOR pathway and migration. In the same study, the authors demonstrated that WNT5A signaling in breast cancer cells increases oxidative phosphorylation.In breast cancer, reconstitution of WNT5A signaling inhibits crucial components of aerobic glycolysis that result in decreased lactate production and uptake suggest that a loss of WNT5A expression might be involved in a metabolic shift to glycolysis during early breast cancer development. The demonstration that reconstitution of WNT5A signaling impairs breast cancer cell migration and invasion is dependent on an impaired aerobic glycolysis and a restored oxidative phosphorylation strengthens its therapeutic importance in breast cancer cells lacking an endogenous expression of the WNT5A protein.Therapeutic targeting of WNT5A signalingPresence of the WNT5A ligand in human breast cancer correlates with increased disease-free survival and overall survival, indicating that WNT5A functions as a tumor suppressor. The concept that WNT5A acts as a suppressor of breast cancer progression is also supported by the results of numerous in vitro studies, indicating that WNT5A primarily reduces the migratory and invasive capacities of breast cancer cells. The idea would then be to reconstitute WNT5A signaling in patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer with low or absent endogenous expression of WNT5A protein in their cancer tissue. A reconstitution of WNT5A signaling in such patients would then serve as a complementary therapy to the presently employed treatment by the ability of the reconstituted WNT5A signaling to specifically impair the dissemination process of such tumors.The WNT5A molecule is a relatively large and complex protein with numerous cysteine residues. Its activity is dependent on different post-translational modifications. Furthermore, the WNT5A molecule is hydrophobic\u00a0and has a heparin sulfate-binding domain important for its auto- and paracrine functions that make it less likely that the WNT5A molecule can be used for systemic treatment since it will not reach and target breast cancer cells. Taken together, these properties make the WNT5A molecule unsuitable as a drug candidate. All of these problems could be overcome if one could define a small molecule that mimics the functional responses triggered by the WNT5A molecule.In search of a WNT5A-mimicking molecule, we collaborated with Dr. Villoutreix (INSERM, Paris). Based on sequence analysis of WNT5A, we identified several peptide sequences predicted to be solvent exposed and thus able to interact with receptor structures exposed on cancer cells. We identified two peptide sequences that had the ability, similar to rWNT5A, to impair migration of breast cancer cells lacking endogenous expression of the WNT5A protein. We continued our study by further investigating the shorter of these two peptides, which contained 12 amino acids. This 12-amino acid peptide was shortened with 2 amino acids at a time from the N-terminal side to investigate how short this peptide could be and still keep its anti-migratory ability in breast cancer cells. When only six amino acids were left, this peptide had lost its functional abilities. However, the N-terminal amino acid in this hexapeptide was a methionine. Based on how bacteria synthesize their proteins, we decided to formylate this N-terminal methionine. This modification regained the functional WNT5A-mimicking activity of this hexapeptide. The fact that small formylated peptides released from bacteria at the site of an infection are functionally active in an environment of low pH and high protease activity suggested to us that our formylated WNT5A-derived hexapeptide (Foxy5) would similarly resist degradation in the tumor microenvironment, a site also likely to have a low pH and elevated protease activity.Anti-metastatic effects of Foxy5 during the initial stages of metastasis. A schematic drawing that presents a simplified and step-wise (steps 1 to 7) cartoon of the metastatic processes. We have highlighted the inhibitory effect of Foxy5 on two important and initial events of metastatic process, i.e., detachment and subsequent migration of cancer cells (step no. 2) and next release of degrading enzymes thereby enabling the tumor cells to penetrate through the basement membrane (BM) (step no. 3)Foxy5 inhibits lung metastasis of breast cancer cells directly injected into the blood stream. Animal experiments were conducted to evaluate a possible anti-metastatic effect of Foxy5 on breast cancer cells injected into the blood stream via the tail vein of nude mice. The animals were injected with luciferase-labeled MDA-MB-231-LM2-4175 breast cancer cells and divided into three different groups depending on how they were treated with either vehicle or Foxy5. The vehicle-treated animals refer to group 1, the animals treated with Foxy5 represent group 2, and group 3 represent the animal where the MDA-MB-231-LM2-4175 breast cancer cells were first pre-treated with Foxy5 in vitro before inoculated into the tail vein and then treated with Foxy5 as the mice in group 2. The amounts of breast cancer lung metastases were determined by four different means to properly evaluate the anti-metastatic effect of Foxy5. The lung metastasis was evaluated through a lung BLI, b H.E. staining, c Vimentin staining, and d ratio: lung weight/animal weightFoxy5 targets initial as well as later metastatic stages during breast cancer progression. The schematic diagram is outlining various steps (1\u20137) involved in cancer cell metastasis. In this figure, we have updated and high-lighted that Foxy5 could indeed target three important steps of cancer cell metastasis, i.e., detachment and subsequent migration of cancer cells (step no. 2), next release of degrading enzymes thereby enabling the tumor cells to penetrate through the basement membrane (BM) (step no. 3), and also adhesion to and migration through the vessel wall (extravasation) (step no. 6)In subsequent animal experiments with WNT5A-negative 4T1 breast cancer cells inoculated orthotopically in mammary fat pads, we were able to show that treatment every 4th day with Foxy5 for up to 24\u00a0days significantly reduced the metastatic spread by 70\u201380%. In these experiments, we started the Foxy5 treatment the same day as the tumor cells were injected into the mammary fat pads. This prompt treatment with Foxy5 and the trend of Foxy5 to increase the primary tumor volume in the mice were the reason why our initial working hypothesis, outlined in Fig.\u00a02, was that Foxy5 affected early events in the metastatic process (steps no. 2 and 3). Consequently, at this stage, our working hypothesis was that Foxy5 acts at the first steps of the metastatic process and that it is hindering the tumor cells to spread from the primary tumor site by counteracting step number 2 and 3 in the schematic drawing as outlined in Fig. 2. However, it cannot be excluded that Foxy5 could also affect later steps in the metastatic process. Foxy5 and its anti-metastatic potential were patented and a small Swedish biotech company named WntResearch AB that has since worked on Foxy5\u2019s clinical development now holds the patents. The company first performed pre-clinical toxicological studies in preparation for clinical phase 1 studies; these revealed no major adverse effects. The in vivo study revealing an anti-metastatic effect of Foxy5 in breast cancer models was performed after inoculation of the tumor cells into the mammary fat pads and prior to the metastatic spread of the disease. Therefore, another question is if Foxy5 will differently affect the metastatic process in patients with already established metastatic disease and with a high likelihood to have circulating tumor cells. To experimentally test this issue, we injected human MDA-MB-231-LM2-4175 TNBC cells directly into the tail vein of immune-deficient mice and started the treatment of these animals with Foxy5 directly after this and then every 2nd day for 13\u00a0days. These human breast cancer cells originated from Dr. Massagu\u00e9\u2019s laboratory and have been enriched for their ability to metastasize to the lungs and have also been luciferase-labeled to enable detection of metastatic foci. Pharmatest Services Ltd. (Turku, Finland) was contracted to conduct these animal experiments and after the termination of the experiments sent primary cancer tissue together with the lungs of the animals for immunohistochemical analyses in our lab. To avoid the difficulty of proper solution of Foxy5, the company received Foxy5 lyophilized in TRIS salts. The results (Fig.\u00a03) show that in comparison with vehicle-treated animals (group 1), there was an approximately 50% reduction in lung metastasis if the animals were treated with Foxy5 (group 2). The reason for choosing vehicle-treated animals as controls is our observation that a formylated control peptide had a high risk of triggering activation of macrophages that would cause an increased metastatic spread. Such an effect would then result in an erroneous too large anti-metastatic effect of Foxy5. This effect was not increased if the cells were also pre-treated with Foxy5 in vitro before being inoculated into the tail veins and the animals treated with Foxy5 (group 3). These data indicate that Foxy5 impairs breast cancer metastasis at two different sites of the metastatic process. This is now outlined in the supplemented schematic outline, where Foxy5 is shown to interfere with the metastatic process of breast cancer (Fig.\u00a04). These findings are in good agreement with those published by Jiang and co-workers, who worked with WNT5A-expressing MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast cancer cells exhibiting reduced cell migration (but normal cell growth) compared to their respective control cells not expressing WNT5A. Most importantly, in the present context, the authors demonstrated significant reductions in lung metastasis when WNT5A-expressing 4T1 cells were injected via the tail vein compared to 4T1-control cells lacking WNT5A expression.Patients included in a phase 1 clinical studies of oncological drug candidates are normally those with advanced metastatic cancer. This means that an anti-metastatic effect of Foxy5 cannot be evaluated in the patients included in any of the company\u2019s phase 1 studies. The first phase 1 clinical study of Foxy5 has been completed (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02020291) and it revealed no major adverse reactions to this drug candidate. This is very good from the perspective of combining Foxy5 treatment with the present cytotoxic drug treatments but it imposes a problem in that no maximal tolerable dose could be defined and consequently the data could not be used for defining the dose for a subsequent phase 2 study. In order to define such a dose for a phase 2 study, a phase 1b study with a different design had to be performed (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT 02655952). In this phase 1b study, blood samples and tumor biopsies will be taken before and after the treatment with Foxy5 and a suitable dose for a phase 2 study will be chosen based on analyses of its biological activity. Once a dose has been decided, one could then evaluate the efficacy of Foxy5 in combination, sequentially or simultaneously, with conventional therapies in the treatment of cancer patients with a low or no expression of the WNT5A protein in their primary tumor. This would be particularly useful for breast cancer patients that harbor a high risk of progressing to metastatic disease, such as TNBC patients. To effectively stop tumor metastasis, a future anti-metastatic complementary treatment should be introduced as soon as possible after diagnosed with breast cancer.Once the phase 1b study has been completed, the dose for the phase 2 study will be decided. The phase 2 study will be performed in patients who lack expression of WNT5A protein or exhibit a low level of WNT5A protein expression in their primary tumors and who have no distal metastases at the time at which the Foxy5 treatment is initiated. Such a phase 2 study will finally answer the question of whether Foxy5 has the same anti-metastatic effect in humans as it has been shown to have in animal experiments.Safety issues with Foxy5We have not noted any adverse effects of treating mice with Foxy5 in any of the in vivo experiments, in the present study or our previous studies. These findings have been confirmed in pre-clinical toxicological studies in rats and dogs and in the clinical phase 1 studies performed on cancer patients. This lack of toxicity of Foxy5 will make it easier to combine, sequentially or simultaneously, with presently used chemotherapies or targeted cancer therapies that can have substantial toxic side effects. Another safety issue with Foxy5 is based on the findings that WNT5A promotes tumor progression in tumors such as melanoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Although a limited number of patients diagnosed with breast cancer could have a history of tumors such as melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or gastric cancer, such patients should not be treated with Foxy5. In the performed phase 1 studies, patients with a previous history of such tumors were excluded from participating in the study.ConclusionsNumerous studies of how WNT5A signaling affects cancer cell behavior, in vitro, have successfully been performed with rWNT5A. It has been shown that treatment of invasive breast cancer cells with rWNT5A increase their adhesion resulting in a reduction of their migration and invasion. However, the development of WNT5A as a therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer patients has been impeded by the fact that WNT5A has a specific heparin sulfate-binding domain that will hinder its distribution in vivo. Furthermore, the WNT5A molecule undergoes several different post-translational modifications required for its biological activity making it less attractive as a drug candidate. Therefore, it was of interest to find a molecule mimicking the tumor suppressor effects of WNT5A on breast cancer cells that could also be used in vivo. We therefore screened for a WNT5A-mimicking peptide and finally, after screening several peptide sequences, we identified a formylated six amino acid peptide named Foxy5 that was found to mimic the signaling and functional effects of rWNT5A on breast cancer cells. In good agreement with our assumption, it was demonstrated that treatment of WNT5A-lacking breast cancer cells with Foxy5 reduces the metastatic spread of breast cancer cells by 70\u201380% in an orthotopic mouse model, highlighting its therapeutic potential as an anti-metastatic drug candidate. Interestingly, in a recent study from our lab, WNT5A and its mimic Foxy5 has been shown to reduce breast cancer cell migration even in the presence of high lactate levels, suggesting its therapeutic potential in managing highly glycolytic breast tumors as well. The majority of in vitro and in vivo experiments on breast cancer cells have been performed on TNBC cell lines and clinical studies on TNBC patients revealed that they have an increased percentage (around 75%) of tumors with no or low expression of WNT5A protein, which might be the reason why they are highly metastatic and associated with early relapse. These findings provide a challenge in taking the drug candidate Foxy5 into the clinic and test its anti-metastatic efficacy in breast cancer patients and then in particular TNBC patients.AbbreviationsDARPP-32Dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 KDaDDR1Discoidin domain receptor-1DVL1Segment polarity protein disheveled homologELAVEmbryonic lethal abnormal visionEMTEpithelial mesenchymal transitionFoxy5Formylated WNT5A-derived hexapeptideFZDFrizzled receptorsGPIGlycosylphosphatidylinositolGPC6Glypican 6HGFHepatocyte growth factorHSPGsHeparin sulfate proteoglycansIDCsInvasive ductal carcinomaLDHLactate dehydrogenaseLRPLow-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein co-receptorsMCT1Monocarboxylate transporter 1NFATNuclear factor associated with T cellsPFKPPhosphofructokinase-platelet typeRBRetinoblastoma proteinRORReceptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor familyrWNT5ARecombinant WNT5ARYKRelated to receptor tyrosine kinaseTGF-\u03b2Transforming growth factor-\u03b2TGF\u03b2R1Transforming growth factor \u03b2-receptor 1TICTumor-initiating cellsTNBCTriple-negative breast cancerWNTWingless-type MMTV integration siteWNT5A-LLong WNT5A mRNA isoformWNT5A-SShort WNT5A mRNA isoformCompliance with ethical standardsConflict of interestTommy Andersson is a shareholder of WntResearch AB and part-time Chief Scientific Officer of WntResearch AB.

Tumor epithelial cells coexist in carcinomas with different stromal cell types that together create the microenvironment of cancer cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the major components of tumor stroma, are active fibroblasts that, similarly to myofibroblasts, are highly heterogeneous, acquire contractile features, and express \u03b1-smooth-muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Active fibroblasts play similar roles in wound healing and in cancer, which may be considered as a wound that does not heal. CAFs represent 80% of the resident fibroblasts in breast tumors. CAFs release high levels of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases that may affect either other stroma cells or cancer cells. Accumulated evidence indicates that they play an important role in cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer. Thus, CAFs represent an attractive target for cancer therapy.Exosomes are small (40\u2013100 nm) vesicles that have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication in cancer. They have been identified in most body fluids, including urine, amniotic fluid, serum, saliva, breast milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and nasal secretions. Exosomes mediate local and systemic cell communication through the horizontal transfer of information, such as microRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins. Over the last decade, a number of studies has revealed that exosomes influence major tumor-related pathways, such as invasion, migration, epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and therapy resistance.MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of non-coding 17\u201324 nucleotide-long RNAs that mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. miRs are involved in many biological activities such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration, disease initiation, and progression. Their deregulation plays an essential role in the development and progression of cancer: miRs are up- or down-regulated in malignant tissues compared to the normal counterpart, and so can be either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Recently, microRNAs have been identified in exosomes, which can be taken up by neighboring or distant cells and subsequently promote oncogenic signaling in recipient cells upon delivery of the cargo.Here, we analyze whether the release of CAF exosomes and their specific miR cargo could dictate an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate that three miRs (miRs -21, -143, and -378e) are released from CAF exosomes. When loaded into breast cancer cells, they promote important tumorigenic features: stemness, EMT, and anchorage-independent cell growth. Thus, the release of CAF exosomes may be responsible for the delivery of miRs that promote oncogenic signaling in breast cancer cells.RESULTSIdentification of oncogenic miRs in CAF exosomesBreast fibroblasts were isolated from human breast biopsies for primary culture. The isolated cultures were characterized by immunocytochemistry for CK22 (pan-keratin) and Western blot analysis for e-cadherin and \u03b1-SMA (Supplementary Figure 1a, b). Exosomes were isolated from breast fibroblast-conditioned media with ExoQuick-TC and characterized by Western blot analysis for the exosomal markers CD63, CD81, Hsp70, and Alix (Supplementary Figure 1c). To identify oncogenic miRs in CAF exosomes, we conducted genome-wide expression profiling of miRs (nCounter miRNA assay, nanoString Technologies, OSU), comparing exosomal miRs derived from two breast CAF cultures (patients #3 and #4) and two normal fibroblast (NF) cultures (patients #1 and #2). We found that three miRs were significantly up-regulated in CAF exosomes respect to NF exosomes: miR-21-5p, miR-378e, and miR-143-3p (Table 1). RT-PCR was conducted to confirm the array data. Interestingly, we found that miR-143-3p was up-regulated in CAF cells as compared to NFs, but we did not observe the same for miR-21-5p or miR-378e (Supplementary Figure 2a, b, c). Furthermore, we analyzed expression levels of miRs -21, -143 and -378e in CAFs from twelve different breast cancer molecular subtypes (five luminal A, six luminal B, one HER-2), but we did not observe a significant correlation between miRs\u2019 levels and molecular subtypes (Supplementary Figure 2d).miRNA expression profiles in NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes\tRatio of geom means: NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes\tUnique id\t \t1\t0,537960845\thsa-miR-21-5p\t \t2\t0,703937608\thsa-miR-378e\t \t3\t0,768350227\thsa-miR-143-3p\t \t4\t0,795360008\thsa-miR-1246\t \t5\t0,813311489\thsa-miR-1253\t \t6\t0,880781514\thsa-miR-155-5p\t \t7\t0,938786077\thsa-miR-549\t \t8\t1,032793771\thsa-miR-125b-5p\t \t9\t1,228928787\thsa-miR-1283\t \t10\t1,256584027\thsa-miR-25-3p\t \t11\t1,294286206\thsa-miR-302d-3p\t \tExosomes were isolated from four primary breast fibroblast cultures: two normal and two cancer-associated cultures. miRNA screening was performed by microarray, as described in Materials and Methods. Fold-change values were generated from the median expression of the miRNAs in the compared groups (NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes). Three miRs were found to be up-regulated in CAF exosomes as compared to NF exosomes.miRs -21, -143, and -378 expression in breast invasive carcinoma patientsWe analyzed miRNA expression in a large cohort of TCGA database breast cancer patients (744 Breast Invasive Carcinoma samples). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between miR-143 and -378 (p<0.0001) and between miR-143 and -21 (p<0.05) expression (Figure 1a). These findings suggest that the co-expression of these miRs may represent a pro-oncogenic signature of Breast Invasive Carcinoma. Furthermore, Log-Rank test analysis indicated that patients with lower levels of miR-378 had longer overall survival, suggestive of a prognostic role of miR-378 (p<0.01) (Figure 1b). In addition, miR-143 expression was significantly increased in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages (p<0.05; Figure 1c).miRs -21, -143, and -378 are co-expressed, miR-378 correlates with prognosis, and miR-143 correlates with tumor stages in breast cancermiR expression was evaluated using 744 Breast Invasive Carcinoma patients from TCGA database.

P<0.05 was considered significant c.Breast fibroblast-derived exosomes are transferred to T47D cellsTo examine whether fibroblast exosomes could be transferred to T47D breast cancer cells, we collected exosomes from NF- and CAF-conditioned media, and fluorescently labeled them with PKH26. T47D cells were treated with labeled exosomes for different times, and then were stained with DAPI and green ALEXA488-conjugated anti-tubulin antibody. Confocal microscopy confirmed the ability of T47D cells to take up NF- (patients #2 and #6) and CAF- (patient #3) derived exosomes (Supplementary Figure 3, Figure 2a). Notably, the uptake was greater after 24 hours (Figure 2a). To get further evidence of exosome uptake, we collected a z-stack of six images (Supplementary Figure 4). NF exosomes (patient #6, Supplementary Figure 4a) and CAF exosomes (patient #3, Supplementary Figure 4b) were clearly taken up by T47D cells after 24 hours, as demonstrated by co-localization of ALEXA488 and PKH26 signals. These results indicate that NF- and CAF-derived exosomes can be transferred to T47D cells, and may play a role in breast cancer biology.Breast fibroblast-derived exosomes are transferred to T47D cells and miRs -21, -143, and -378e are shuttled by CAF exosomes into breast cancer cellsT47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of either NF- (patient #6) or CAF- (patient #3) derived PKH26-labeled exosomes for 24 hours. Exosomes were taken up by T47D cells (confocal microscopy, \u00d760 original magnification). T47D cells were stained using DAPI (nuclei) and ALEXA488-conjugated anti-tubulin antibody. Scale bar: 10\u03bcm a. T47D cells were treated 24 hours in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patient #6) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7 and #8). Real Time PCR was performed to evaluate miRs -21, -143, and -378e levels. Data obtained from three independent experiments and presented as mean value \u00b1 SD. P-value calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing. * p<0.05; ** p<0.01 (over control). \u00a7 p<0.05; \u00a7\u00a7 p<0.01 (over NF ex) b. T47D cells were cultured in the absence (control) or presence of exosomes isolated from cy3-miR-CAF#11 (cy3-miRs -21, -143, -378e) for 24 hours. Cy3-labeled miRs were shuttled from CAF#11 exosomes into T47D cells (confocal microscopy, \u00d760 original magnification). T47D cells were stained using DAPI (nuclei) and ALEXA488-conjugated anti-CD63 antibody. Scale bar: 10\u03bcm c.miRs released by CAFs are shuttled into breast cancer cells via exosomesIn order to demonstrate that CAFs vehiculate miRs -21, -143, and -378e via exosomes to breast cancer cells, we treated T47D cells with isolated CAF- or NF-exosomes (CAF patients #3, #7 and #8, NF patient #6) for 24 hours and then assessed miR levels by RT-PCR. T47D cells treated with CAF exosomes exhibited increased levels of these miRs as compared to either non-treated T47D cells or T47D cells treated with NF exosomes (Figure 2b). In addition, to visualize the transport of extracellular miRs derived from CAFs into T47D cells, we transfected CAFs (patient #11) with cy3-labeled miRs (cy3-miRs -21-5p, -143-3p, -378e) and then collected exosomes from cell media. Then, we cultured T47D cells with these exosomes. Confocal microscopy detected the signals of cy3-miRs in the cytoplasm of T47D cells (Figure 2c). Notably, as shown in z-stack images (Supplementary Figure 5a, b, c), cy3-miRs co-localized with the signals of the exosomal marker CD63. Taken together, these results suggest that CAF-secreted exosomes mediate the shuttling of miRs -21, -143, and -378e into T47D cells.CAF exosomes promote stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent cell growthTo investigate the role of CAF exosomes on stemness, we studied suspension cultures of T47D cells. Briefly, we seeded T47D cells in stem medium in non-adherent conditions in the absence or presence of NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7 and #9). After four days, we assessed the ability of cells to form mammospheres. We observed a significant increase in the number (Figure 3a) and diameter (Figure 3b) of spheres in T47D cells treated with CAF exosomes compared with either non-treated or NF exosome-treated T47D cells, indicating that CAF exosomes increase the ability to form mammospheres. We next investigated whether CAF exosomes had an impact on anchorage-independent cell growth with a soft agar assay. We found that the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes (patients #7, and #12) increased the number of colonies as compared to the treatment of T47D cells with NF exosomes (#5, #6, and #10) (Figure 3c, 3d). Furthermore, the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7, #9, #12 and #13), but not NF exosomes (patients #5, #6 and #10), increased the expression of stemness markers (oct3/4, nanog, sox2) and EMT markers (snail and zeb) at mRNA (Figure 3e) and protein levels (Figure 3f). In addition, the treatment of T47D cells with CAF exosomes decreased protein expression levels of the epithelial marker, e-cadherin (Figure 3f). Similar results were obtained in additional breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 3g). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that CAF exosomes foster cancer progression by promoting stemness properties, EMT phenotype, and anchorage-independent cell growth in breast cancer cells.CAF exosomes promote stemness, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, and anchorage-independent cell growthT47D cells were cultured under non-adherent conditions in stem medium in the absence (control) or presence of either NF exosomes (patients #5, #6, and #10) or CAF exosomes (patients #3, #7, and #9).

MiR levels upon transfection were assessed with Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6a). There was a significant increase in the number (Figure 4a) and diameter (Figure 4b) of mammospheres in T47D cell cultures transfected with miRs -143, -378e, or -21/\u2212143/\u2212378e as compared to scrambled controls. On the contrary, T47D cells transfected with specific anti-miRs displayed a significant decrease in the number (Figure 4c) and diameter (Figure 4d) of mammospheres as compared to T47D cells transfected with anti-scrambled controls. The effects of anti-miR transfection on miR levels were verified by Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6b). Furthermore, we analyzed Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in T47D cells transfected with miRs -21, -143, and -378e for 48h. Interestingly, we observed an increased ALDH activity in T47D cells transfected with miRs as compared to T47D cells transfected with scrambled controls (Figure 4e). Additionally, we assessed the impact of the miRs on the expression of stem cell and EMT markers by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. T47D cells transfected with the miRs showed increased mRNA and protein levels of stemness and EMT markers, and decreased levels of e-cadherin protein, as compared to scrambled controls (Figure 4f, 4g). Similar results were obtained in additional breast cancer cell lines (BT549 and MDA-MB-231) (Figure 5a, 5b). MiR levels in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells upon transfection were assessed by Real time PCR (Supplementary Figure 6a). On the contrary, we found that T47D cells transfected with specific anti-miRs exhibited decreased levels of sox2 mRNA (Figure 5c) and of EMT markers (Figure 5d). We then analyzed the effect of the miRs on anchorage-independent cell growth with a soft agar assay. We observed an increased number of colonies in T47D cells transfected with miRs as compared to scrambled controls (Figure 6a, 6b). Finally, we performed invasion assay in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with miR-21, miR-143 and miR-378e. Breast cancer cells transfected with miRs exhibited higher invasive capacity than cells transfected with scrambled controls (Figure 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f). Taken together, these results clearly support the idea that miRs -21, -143, and -378e, similarly to CAF exosomes, promote anchorage-independent cell growth, stemness, and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells.miR-21, miR-143, and miR-378e promote stemness and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionT47D cells were transfected with scrambled (scr, control) or miRs -21, -143, and -378e, alone or in combination (final concentration: 100nM).

When we performed a mammosphere formation assay, we observed a significant increase in the number (Figure 7a) and diameter (Figure 7b, c) of T47D spheres in cells treated with NF exosomes transfected with miRs compared to cells treated with NF exosomes containing scrambled controls. Furthermore, treated T47D cells had increased levels of stemness (oct3/4, nanog, and sox2) and EMT (snail and zeb) markers as compared to control cells (Figure 7d, e). These data clearly show that NF exosomes enriched in miRs -21, -143, and -378e acquire the ability to promote stemness properties and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells.NF exosomes transfected with miRs -21, -143, -378e, similarly to CAF exosomes, promote stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotypeNF (patients #5, and #6) were cultured for 48h.

Accumulated evidence indicates that CAFs, the major components of tumor stroma, promote tumor processes such as angiogenesis, motility, metastasis, and therapy resistance in several solid tumors. Tumor stroma and tumor cells communicate not only through classical paracrine signaling mechanisms (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors), but also through exosomes. Exosomes are nano-vesicles that vehiculate lipids, proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs among cells, thereby modulating cell biology. It has been recently shown that they play an essential role in cancer development, prognosis, progression, and therapy resistance. In the context of cancer, this process entails the transfer of cancer-promoting cellular contents between cancer cells and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment or into the circulation to act at distant sites, thereby enabling cancer progression. It has been shown that melanoma-derived exosomes from the primary tumor \u201ceducated\u201d their environment to form a pro-tumorigenic niche and programmed bone marrow-derived progenitors at the pre-metastatic site to assume a proangiogenic phenotype, thereby enhancing metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, fibroblast-secreted exosomes promoted breast cancer cell migration through WNT-PCP signaling. More recently, it has been demonstrated that human CAFs secreted ADAM10-rich exosomes that promoted cell motility and activated RhoA and Notch signaling in several cancer cells.In order to develop therapeutic approaches, we analyzed the miR content of exosomes from breast CAFs. We describe here for the first time that CAFs promote breast cancer progression through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic miRs to breast cancer cells. microRNA sequencing identified increased miRs -21, -378e, and -143 levels in CAF exosomes. Immunofluorescence revealed transfer of PKH26-labeled exosomes and their miR content from fibroblasts to breast cancer cells.miR-21 is a well-characterized oncogenic miR. In particular, its presence in breast cancer correlates with poor prognosis, regulates EMT phenotype, and promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Recently, exosomal miR-21 has been reported as an EMT promoter in oral carcinoma. The tumorigenic role of miR-143 depends on the cancer type, and recent findings suggest that it has a critical role in the tumor microenvironment of lung cancer, promoting tumor growth and neoangiogenesis. MiR-378e has not been studied for an oncogenic/oncosuppressive role.We analyzed miRNA expression in a large cohort of breast cancer patients present in the TCGA database. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between miRs-143 and -378 and between miRs-143 and -21 (p<0.05), strongly suggesting that co-expression of these miRs may represent a pro-oncogenic signature. Furthermore, Log-Rank test analysis indicated that patients with lower levels of miR-378 had longer overall survival, suggestive of a prognostic role of miR-378 (p<0.01). Finally, we found that miR-143 expression was significantly increased in high (III/IV) compared to low (I/II) breast cancer stages (p<0.05).Many tumors, including breast cancer, are maintained by a subpopulation of cells that display stem cell properties, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Analogous to the regulation of normal stem cells by their \u201cniche\u201d, CSCs are regulated by, and in turn regulate, cells within the tumor microenvironment. Several studies have provided evidence that these CSCs mediate tumor metastasis and contribute to treatment resistance and relapse. Recent findings have shown that the hierarchically organized cell populations are more plastic than previously imagined. Thus, epithelial cells may dedifferentiate and thereby enter back into the stem cell pool. Thus, therapies aimed at targeting the CSCs within a tumor will not be curative if the pool of CSCs can be continuously regenerated from plastic, non-cancer stem cells capable of dedifferentiating and reentering the CSC state. Notably, accumulating evidence indicates that the expression of oct3/4, nanog, and sox2 transcription factors is strongly correlated with CSCs: knockdown of these genes decreased sphere formation and inhibited tumor development in xenograft tumor models. The transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, a process known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is integral in development, wound healing, and stem cell behavior, and contributes pathologically to fibrosis and cancer progression. This switch is mediated by key transcription factors, including snail and zeb, and is characterized by the loss of epithelial marker expressions, such as e-cadherin. In breast carcinomas, induction of EMT promotes the generation of CSCs that are able to form mammospheres, and, similarly, CSCs isolated from tumors express EMT markers. In this scenario, discovering the underlying mechanisms that promote dedifferentiation processes could provide new targets for therapeutic strategies.In the present study, we demonstrate that CAF exosomes and their miRs promote dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells. For the first time, we provide evidence that CAF exosomal miRs induce stemness and EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells. Moreover, normal fibroblast exosomes transfected with these miRs promoted stemness and EMT, similarly to CAF exosomes. Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells treated with CAF exosomes or transfected with miR-143 and miR-378e showed increased capacity to form mammospheres. Importantly, normal fibroblast exosomes, once transfected with miRs -378e, and -143, similarly to CAF exosomes, promoted the mammosphere formation. On the contrary, breast cancer cells co-transfected with combinations of specific anti-miRs displayed a strong reduction of these effects, thereby underlying a good strategy to prevent dedifferentiation of breast cancer cells. Finally, we found that CAF exosomes and their miRs increased anchorage-independent cell growth in breast cancer cells. Our data show that the identified miRs does not act in a synergic way, but together they may favor an aggressive phenotype: miR-21 seems to be the best inducer of anchorage-independent cell growth and increases stemness and EMT markers, while miR-143 and miR-378e are the strongest promoters of stemness. In summary, we conclude that CAFs regulate the development of an aggressive phenotype in breast cancer cells through exosome-mediated delivery of oncogenic miRs.MATERIALS AND METHODSPrimary and continuous cells and mammosphere culturesBreast cancer cell lines, T47D, BT549, MDA-MB-231 from ATCC, were grown in RPMI-1640 medium. Primary cultures of fibroblasts, deriving from patients treated at the Clinica Mediterranea (Naples, Italy), were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Nutrient F12-Ham (DMEM-F12). Media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All media and supplements were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy).For mammosphere cultures, single-cell suspensions were plated at a density of 1,000 cells/ml in Corning ultra-low attachment multi-well plates. Cells were grown in stem medium: serum-free DMEM-F12 (Sigma, Milan, Italy) supplemented with B27 (Life technologies, Milan, Italy), 20ng/ml EGF (Sigma, Milan, Italy), 10ng/ml bFGF (BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy), and 1X antibiotic-antimycotics (Life technologies, Milan, Italy). After 4-7 days, mammospheres appeared as spheres of floating viable cells.Isolation of primary cell cultures from human breast biopsiesHuman breast biopsies (samples from the Clinica Mediterranea) were cut by mechanical fragmentation with sterile scissors and tongs. Extracellular matrix was digested with collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight under continuous agitation at 37\u00b0C. The drawn cellular suspensions were separated on the basis of their weights by two different centrifugations: the first one at 500 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain epithelial cell pellets, the second one at 1200 rpm 5 minutes to obtain fibroblast pellets.ImmunocytochemistryThe separation between epithelial cells and fibroblasts from human breast biopsies was confirmed by the cell block technique (Shandon cytoblock kit) followed by immunocytochemistry. A primary antibody was used for CK22 (pan-keratin), a known epithelial marker, in order to discriminate epithelial cells from fibroblasts.Exosome isolationExosomes were isolated from cell culture media of primary fibroblasts that were grown in DMEM-F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% Exo-FBS (FBS depleted of exosomes, SBI, System Biosciences) and 1X antibiotic-antimycotics (Life technologies, Milan, Italy). Culture media were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C or room temperature to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred to sterile tubes in an appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC\u2122 Exosome Isolation Reagent (SBI, System Biosciences), considering 2 ml of ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution for every 10 ml of cell culture medium. Then, the tubes were subjected to mild agitation until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. Finally, the tubes were kept at 4\u00b0C O/N (12 hours at least were necessary). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged firstly at 1500 g for 30 minutes, and then at 1500 g for 5 minutes (at 4\u00b0C or RT). At the end of the steps, white/beige exosomal pellets appeared.RNA extraction and real time PCRTotal RNA (microRNAs and mRNAs) was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed starting from equal amounts of total RNA/sample (150/500ng) using miScript reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) for miR analysis, and using SuperScript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) for mRNA analysis. Quantitative analysis of miR-21, miR-143, miR-378e and RNU6A (as an internal reference) was performed by Real Time PCR using specific primers (Qiagen, Milan, Italy) and miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Milan, Italy). Real Time PCR was also used to assess the mRNAs of nanog, oct3/4, sox2, snail, zeb, and \u03b2-actin (as an internal reference), using iQ\u2122 SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).

The reaction for detection of miRs was performed in this manner: 95\u00b0C for 15\u2032, 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15\u2032\u2019, 55\u00b0C for 30\u2032\u2019 and 70\u00b0C for 30\u2032\u2019. All reactions were run in triplicate. The threshold cycle (CT) is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. For relative quantization, the 2(\u2212\u0394\u0394CT) method was used. Experiments were carried out in triplicate for each data point, and data analysis was performed by using Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus\u2122 Real-Time PCR Systems.NCounter miRNA assayExosomes were isolated from four different samples of primary fibroblasts: two normal and two cancer-associated fibroblasts. Then, exosomal RNA was extracted in order to perform an \u201cnCounter miRNA assay\u201d (nanoString Technologies, OSU, Columbus, OHIO). Eight-hundred human miRs were digitally detected and counted in a single reaction without amplification. System performance consisted of 6 positive miRNA assay controls, 6 negative miRNA assay controls, and 5 mRNA housekeeping controls. 100ng of purified total RNA was used as starting material. miR expression levels were measured calculating the ratio of geom. means (NF exosomes vs CAF exosomes).TCGA data analysisThe collection of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) platform was compliant with laws and regulations for the protection of human subjects, and necessary ethical approvals were obtained. Analysis of all data was done using GraphPad Prism 6 (San Diego, CA, USA). For our analysis, we downloaded BCGSC IlluminaHiSeq_miRNASeq (level 3) along with clinical information from the TCGA database in July 2015.Cell and exosome transfectionFor transient over-expression/downregulation of miRs, cells at 50% confluence were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and 100nM of pre-miR-21, pre-miR-143-3p, pre-miR-378e, or scrambled pre-miR; or 200nM of anti-miR-21, anti-miR-143-3p, anti-miR-378e, or scrambled anti-miR (Ambion\u00ae, Life Technologies). For miR over-expression, exosomes isolated with ExoQuick-TC\u2122 solution were transfected using Exo-Fect\u2122 Exosome Transfection Reagent (SBI, System Biosciences) and 130nM of pre-miR-21, pre-miR-143-3p, pre-miR-378e, or scrambled pre-miR.Transfection of CAFs with Cy3-labeled-miRsCAFs were transfected with 10nM of Cy3-labeled miRs (miR-21-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-378e, Tebu-bio, San Diego, CA, USA) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy). Six hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the culture media switched to fresh DMEM-F12 1% A/A, 10% exo-FBS. After incubation for a day, the culture media were collected and used for exosome preparation.Protein isolation and western blottingCells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in JS buffer (50mM HEPES ph 7.5 containing 150mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 1.5mM MgCl2, 5mM EGTA, 1mM Na3VO4, and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail). Exosomes were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard, and equal amounts of proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%, 12% or 15% acrylamide). Gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). For immunoblot experiments, membranes were blocked for 1 hour with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) containing 0,1% Tween-20, and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies. Detection was performed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Thermo, Euroclone, Milan, Italy). Primary antibodies used were: anti-\u03b2-actin and anti-\u03b1-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy), anti-vinculin, anti-\u03b1-SMA, anti-e-cadherin, anti-zeb, anti-oct3/4, anti-nanog, anti-sox2, anti-slug, anti-snail, anti-CD63, anti-hsp70, anti-alix, anti-CD81 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). ImageJ software was used to provide WB quantification.Immunofluorescence analysis1) Uptake of fibroblast exosomes by T47D cells. Once isolated, exosomes were labeled with PKH26, a red fluorescent cell membrane linker (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, exosomes were stained 5 minutes at RT with PKH26 (diluted 1:1000 in PBS), then 1ml of BSA 1% was added to the tubes and mixed. Finally, the tubes were centrifuged at 1500 g for 5 minutes and pellets were put in 500\u03bcl of PBS. For immunofluorescence, cells grown on glass coverslips were treated at different incubation times with PKH26-exosomes, washed six times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times in PBS. Then, cells were permeabilized with PBS 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 minutes at room temperature, and blocked in PBS 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 minutes. Cells were incubated with anti-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz), diluted in PBS 1% BSA, for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed 3 times with PBS and treated with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Coverslips were washed and mounted with Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. 2) Shuttling assays for fluorescently-labeled miRNAs. After a day from the transfection of CAFs with Cy3-labeled-miRs, exosomes were isolated from cell media, and T47D cells grown on glass coverslips were treated for 24 hours with the isolated exosomes. For immunofluorescence, it was used the same protocol as above, but cells were incubated with anti-CD63 primary antibody (Santa Cruz), then with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen).Mammosphere formation assayT47D cells were suspended 1000 cells/well in 1 ml of stem medium and plated into ultra-low attachment 48-well plates in presence of normal fibroblast or CAF exosomes. Alternatively, T47D cells were transfected with miRs or anti-miRs for 48 hours or 24 hours, respectively. Then, 1000 cells/well were suspended in 1 ml of stem medium and plated into ultra-low attachment 48-well plates. After 4-7 days, the formed mammospheres were counted, and the diameters were measured.ALDEFLUOR assayThe ALDEFLUOR assay was carried out according to manufacturer's (Stemcell Technologies) guidelines. Briefly, dissociated single cells were suspended in Aldefluor assay buffer containing an ALDH substrate, bodipy-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) (5\u03bcl per milliliter of sample), and incubated for 40 min at 37\u00b0C. A fraction of cells was incubated under identical conditions in the presence of ALDH inhibitor (10\u03bcl per milliliter of sample), diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). Cells were analyzed using a BD Accuri\u2122 C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer and analyzed using the BD Accuri\u2122 C6 software.Soft-agar assay104 cells were plated in 60mm dishes in a solution containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 2\u00d7 (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), TPB Buffer (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and 1.25% of Noble Agar (Difco, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly, cells were harvested and counted, then a layer of 7ml with the solution containing Noble Agar were left to polymerize on the bottom of the dishes. Finally, cells were resuspended in 2ml of same solution and plated. Cells were left grown for 3 weeks in the incubator.Invasion assayIn vitro invasion assay was performed in 24-well Corning Multiwells 6.5mm Transwell\u00ae with 8.0\u03bcm Pore Polycarbonate Membrane Inserts. The lower chamber was filled with 600\u03bcl of RPMI medium supplemented with 10%FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotics. The top of the upper wells was coated with 25\u03bcl of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD) diluted 1:6 in RPMI free medium and allowed to dry out at 37\u00b0C at least 4h. Then, 50.000 cells, previously transfected with miRs for 48h, were plated in RPMI free medium in the upper chamber. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20h. Then, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed mechanically by wiping with a cotton swab, and the cells remaining on the lower side of the membrane were fixed and stained with Crystal Violet solution. Percentage of invasive cells was evaluated by eluting Crystal Violet solution with 1% SDS and reading the absorbance at \u03bb570nm.Statistical analysisAll experiments were repeated at least three times. Continuous variables are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. For comparisons between two groups, the Student's t test was used to determine differences between mean values for normally distributed. Comparisons among more than three groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc testing. All data were analyzed for significance using GraphPad Prism 6 software (San Diego, CA, USA). P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS FIGURESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors disclose no potential conflicts of interest.FUNDINGThis work was partially supported by funds from Associazione Italiana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC grant number 18473) to G.C.; Fondazione Berlucchi to G.C.REFERENCESBasal-like breast cancer: update on clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular featuresThe role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancerTumors: wounds that do not heal.

        "content": "Stroma-derived exosomal microRNA (exomiR) contributes to tumor progression, however, which remains poorly understood. In our study, we analyzed exomiRs from the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and normal fibroblast (NF) isolated from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patient and found that the level of microRNA (miR)-4516 was approximately 5-fold lower in CAF-derived exosomes than NF-derived ones. In gene annotation analysis, miR-4516 target genes were mainly associated with the regulation of proliferation. miR-4516 overexpression or mimic treatment suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer cells, especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Among miR-4516 targets, FOSL1 was overexpressed in TNBC cells compared to non-TNBC cells and promoted tumor proliferation. The expression of miR-4516 and FOSL1 was reversely correlated in breast cancer patient tissues. Particularly, TNBC patients with high FOSL1 expression showed a significant poorer survival than those with low FOSL1 expression. Our results show that the loss of miR-4516 from CAF-derived exosomes is associated with FOSL1-dependent TNBC progression and suggest that miR-4516 can be used as an anti-cancer drug for TNBC.",

TNBC subtype is the most challenging diagnosis among BC patients due to the aggressive nature of the disease and the high metastatic potency of tumor cells which is responsible for the dismal clinical outcome as compared to other BC subtypes. Therapeutic options for patients with TNBC are limited because no pathway-specific targets and associated biomarkers have been established. Such a situation is further challenged by the fact that the disease is heterogeneous. Although reports have indicated the involvement of certain genes/signaling molecules related to tumorigenic/metastatic pathways in this subset of BC, there remains an unmet need for an in-depth study to establish a pathway-specific targeted therapy in TNBC, especially in the context of metastatic setting.The Wnt-beta-catenin pathway (WP) is a ligand-driven signaling pathway which regulates several cellular phenotypes in development and disease. Activation of the pathway leads to a context-dependent transcription of beta-catenin target genes including MMP7 and c-MYC to directly control cellular phenotypes including survival, proliferation, migration, polarity and matrix remodeling.We and others have demonstrated a subtype-specific association of the WP upregulation in BC. Reis-Filho's team reported that WP activation is (1) preferentially found in TN/basal-like breast carcinomas, (2) associated with poor clinical outcome and (3) unlikely to be driven by CTNNB1 mutations in BC. In line with this report, we have demonstrated a differential upregulation of the various components of the WP at both transcript and protein levels (in tumor samples from multiple cohorts and cell line based models) in this subset of BC. Our data are in agreement with a previous report by Khramtsov et al., regarding an association of WP signaling in poor-prognosis TNBC patients with metastasis. In line with the above results, we have identified that the differential upregulation of WP in TNBC is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis.Although all the above studies collectively identify that WP upregulation is one of the salient genetic features of TNBC, the role of the WP in the control of tumorigenic signals and MA phenotypes in TNBC cells is not known yet. Since the outcome of TNBC is connected to the aggressive metastatic behavior of the disease and a differentially upregulated WP in this subtype is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis, we hypothesized that the upregulation of WP in aggressive TNBC is functionally associated with metastasis-associated (MA) phenotypes. Thus to understand the functional relevance of the WP pathway in the biology of metastasizing TNBC tumor cells, we have undertaken a comprehensive and in-depth study in which the involvement of WP is tested in the context of MA phenotypes.Here we demonstrated that the WP is causally associated with the regulation of key components of integrin-mediated MA phenotypes including fibronectin-directed migration, matrigel-invasion and clonogenicity in TNBC. Considering the fact that a significant percentage of the patients with TNBC develop brain metastasis, we extended our study towards testing the role of WP in the metastatic settings by using brain-metastasis specific TNBC cells (the brain-tropic 231-BR experimental brain metastasis model of TNBC), MDA-MB231BR and demonstrated that LWnt3ACM stimulated cell proliferation, clonogenicity and fibronectin-directed migration were abrogated in MDA-MB231BR cells by the blockade of WP signals following the treatment with sulindac sulfide, WP modulators, GDC-0941 and siRNA, which downregulated beta-catenin. Based on our and others\u2019 reports that WP is differentially activated in TNBC, we here establish the function of WP in TNBC especially in metastatic settings to mechanistically explain our previous observation that Wnt signaling in TNBC is associated with metastasis which leads to poor outcome. In the light of (1) the report from Reis-Filho's team demonstrating a preferential increase in beta-catenin protein (IHC) in TNBC patients, (2) CTNNB1 amplification observed in tumors from our Avera patients and (3) our previous report, here we present the first genetic and pharmacological evidence to demonstrate a direct functional relationship between the activation of the WP and key components of MA phenotypes. To the best our knowledge, this is the first report to reveal a direct functional connection between subset-specific upregulation of the WP and key components of integrin-mediated MA phenotypes in TNBC more specifically in the context of brain metastasis.RESULTSAlterations of CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 genes in all BC cases and different BC subtypes, cBioPortal dataPercentages of alterations in the WP specific CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 genes among all tumors samples of breast invasive carcinomas (TCGA 2012) varied from 6-8% in between individual genes (CTNNB1, 8%; APC, 6%; DVL1, 7%) while alterations of same genes among breast invasive carcinomas, PAM50 Basal-like (TCGA 2012) varied from 15-21% (CTNNB1, 21%; APC, 20%; DVL1, 15%). The collective % of alterations in CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 genes among total breast invasive carcinomas (TCGA 2012) were 21% in contrast to 56% breast invasive carcinomas, PAM50 Basal-like (TCGA 2012) (Figure 1A). A similar trend was observed among subtypes of tumors from brca/tcga/pub2015 (cBioPortal). In this data set, the percentage of alterations in CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 genes among all tumors samples (1105 cases/patients) varied from 5-8% in between individual genes (CTNNB1, 8%; APC, 7%; DVL1, 5%). The collective percentage of alterations in CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 genes among total 1105 cases/patients were 20%. Although the collective changes in the percentage varied between luminal A (8%), luminal B (17%) and Her2-enriched (26%) subtypes, the pattern of percentage changes of the individual genes of CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 in luminal A, luminal B and Her2-enriched subtypes remained comparable to TCGA2012 data set (Supplementary Figure S5). In contrast, both collective changes in the percentage (37% in PAM50 Basal-like subtype of IDC and 40% in triple negative breast tumors) as well as the percentage of alterations of individual genes of CTNNB1 (15% in PAM50 Basal-like subtype of IDC and 18% in triple negative breast tumors), APC (9% for both) and DVL1 (13% for both) were found significantly higher in both PAM50 Basal-like subtype of IDC and triple negative breast tumors as compared to other subtypes of BC (Figure 1B).Alterations of WP genes in TNBC and basal-like BC subtypesA.

Protein level obtained from IHC staining (cBioPortal).WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide downregulated total beta-catenin levels in MDA-MB468 and Hs578t TNBC cellsLigand-receptor engagement in the WP has been known to increase the half-life of beta-catenin (Figure 10) by blocking the degradation of beta-catenin. According to the model described by Staal et al., the changes in beta-catenin stability set the threshold of Wnt signaling. We used WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide to downregulate cellular levels of beta-catenin in some TNBC cell lines. Our in vitro phenotypic experiments focused on beta-catenin because beta-catenin is the functional as well as a biochemical readout of WP and it can be pharmacologically targeted (by sulindac sulfide) as well as tested in clinical trials. Sulindac and its derivatives are known to decrease beta-catenin expression and beta-catenin transcriptional activities in breast cancer and APC-mutated colorectal tumor cells. Sulindac sulfide treatment dose-dependently decreased total beta-catenin levels in MDA-MB468 and Hs578t TNBC cells (Figure 2A). Results have been semi-quantified using Image J. In our previous studies we also demonstrated that sulindac sulfide administration (25-100 \u03bcM) caused a dose-dependent decrease in cellular levels of beta-catenin in BT20 and SUM149 TNBC cells. A similar dose and time-dependent attenuation of beta-catenin levels were also reported as early as 24 hours after treatment with sulindac sulfide or sulindac sulfone (ranges 120-600\u03bcM) via three different ways of induction of beta-catenin degradation. We observed a similar decrease in the levels of beta-catenin in MDA-MB468 and Hs578t (Figure 2A) as well as BT20 and SUM149 TNBC cells which justified our use of sulindac sulfide in the subsequent experiments.Effect of sulindac sulfide on (A) the expression of total beta-catenin protein, (B) the clonogenic 3D growth, (C) fibronectin-mediated migration by transwell assay, (D) fibronectin-mediated migration by scratch assay and (E) motility descriptors of real-time movement of live TNBC cellsA. Cells were treated with sulindac sulfide (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) and total beta-catenin levels were determined by WB. B. Cells were treated with sulindac sulfide (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) and their 3D clonogenic growth was tested. C. Sulindac sulfide treatment blocked fibronectin-mediated migration of HCC1937 and MDA-MB468 in a transwell assay (*p< 0.05). D. Sulindac sulfide treatment dose-dependently (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) inhibited migration of HCC1937 and MDA-MB468 TNBC cells in the scratch assay (*p< 0.05). E. Sulindac sulfide (50 \u03bcM) also blocked (*p< 0.05) the trajectory of the movement of MDA-MB231 cells as measured by the nuclear tracking paths of the migrating live cells semi-quantified by two motility descriptors, average velocity (Upper bar diagram on the left) and MRDO, maximum relative distance from the origin (Upper bar diagram on the right). Vehicle-treated (control) and sulindac sulfide treated cells are imaged in real time. Nuclear tracking paths of the migrating cells are shown as track overlays. Bars represent Mean \u00b1 S.D. of the average velocity (\u03bcM/Hour) and MRDO (\u03bcM) of the cells in the presence (dark vertical bar) and absence (open bar) of sulindac sulfide. *p<0.01.Effects of sulindac sulfide on metastasis-associated phenotypes in TNBC cellsHaving used sulindac sulfide to decrease cellular levels of beta-catenin, we went on to test the effect of the inhibitor on different phenotypes. They are (i) 3D clonogenic growth, (ii) fibronectin-directed migration in transwell and scratch assays, (iii) fibronectin-directed real-time movement of live cells in wound-healing assay, (iv) motility descriptors including average velocity (AV) and maximum relative distance from the origin (MRDO) in live cells, (v) architecture of filamentous actin on fibronectin, (vi) podia-parameters (filopodia and lamellipodia), (vii) fibronectin-directed matrigel-invasion and (viii) levels of active beta-catenin as well as the expression of its invasion specific target gene, MMP7. Sulindac sulfide had been known to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells and diminished expression of the proliferation markers PCNA and Ki-67. We first tested the effect of sulindac sulfide on the clonogenic growth of TNBC cells. Sulindac sulfide dose-dependently (50 and 100 microM) blocked the 3D clonogenic growth in SUM149 cells (Figure 2B).Sulindac sulfide blocked fibronectin-directed transwell migration in HCC1937 and MDA-MB468 cells (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S4) as well as abrogated fibronectin-directed migration (scratch assay) (Figure 2D). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the migratory property (transwell and scratch assays) of different BC cell lines. Next, we tested the fibronectin-directed real-time movement of live MDA-MB231 cells in wound-healing assay following sulindac sulfide treatment (Supplementary Movie: M1 & M2). As sulindac sulfide inhibited fibronectin-directed real-time movement of live MDA-MB231 cells in a wound-healing assay, we tested the effect of the drug on motility descriptors, average velocity (AV) and maximum relative distance from the origin (MRDO) in live MDA-MB231 cells (Figure 2E). Vehicle-treated (control) and sulindac sulfide treated (50 microM) cells are imaged for the purpose. Image analysis from the time-lapse images of fibronectin-directed migration of cells in scratch wound healing assay demonstrated that sulindac sulfide (50 microM) administration impaired migration of cells. Control cells migrated exhibiting directional movement into the fibronectin coated area (open space) with well-formed lamellae protruding from the leading edge of cells (Figure 2E). In contrast, treated cells exhibited truncated lamellae in limited numbers which corresponded with their limited migration. Nuclear tracking paths of the migrating cells as shown in track overlays demonstrated the trajectory of the movement of the cells characterized by two quantitative motility descriptors, AV and MRDO. Data showed that the treatment of sulindac sulfide has a significant anti-migratory effect on TNBC cells.The intracellular architecture of filamentous actin directly controls the integrin-guided movements of cells. Since we observed blockade of cell movement in real time and demonstrated the abrogation of the motility descriptors following sulindac sulfide in TNBC cells, we wanted to test the effect of the drug on the architecture of filamentous actin. Figure 3 showed that the treatment with sulindac sulfide disrupted the architecture of filamentous actin in MDA-MB468 and SUM149 TNBC cells (Figure 3) on fibronectin. The formation of lamellipodia and filopodia are directly controlled by the intracellular architecture of filamentous actin. Hence, we next tested the podia-parameters of TNBC cells on fibronectin following the treatment of cells with sulindac sulfide. Figure 4 showed that sulindac sulfide decreased lamellipodia of HCC38 and Hs578t TNBC cells on fibronectin while the filopodia numbers per cell were increased.Sulindac sulfide treatment caused a loss of the cytoskeletal architecture of the filamentous actin in MDA-MB468 A. and SUM149 B. cellsTNBC cells were stained with phalloidin 555 for the confocal microscopy to test the effect of sulindac sulfide on the cytoskeletal architecture of the filamentous actin. The cells were stained with DAPI as a counterstain. Cells are imaged using Zeiss LSM 510 Metasystem. Successive Z-sections across cells were represented in the picture (consecutive photomicrographs) to demonstrate the effect of sulindac sulfide (photomicrographs i-p) on the organization of the filamentous actin as compared to the respective controls (photomicrographs a-h).Sulindac sulfide treatment altered podia-parameters (lamellipodia and filopodia) of HCC38 A. and Hs578t B. cellsTNBC cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated coverslips. Control and sulindac sulfide treated (50 \u03bcM) cells were fixed in warm reconstituted PHEMO buffer before they were stained with phalloidin 555 and counterstained with DAPI. Filopodia (short arrowheads) and lamellipodia (arrows) were identified under a confocal microscope (Z-sections) as presented in the inset of individual cells. The semi-quantification was performed using ten randomly chosen fields from 4 independently performed experiments (*p<0.01).Integrin-directed migration of tumor cells helps them to invade through ECM. We studied fibronectin-directed matrigel-invasion as one of the MA phenotypes because it involves migration of cells as well as requires matrix degradation activity of matrix metalloprotease-like MMP7 which is a WP specific ECM-degrading metalloprotease. Figure 5 showed that sulindac sulfide blocked fibronectin-directed matrigel-invasion of MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and SUM149 cells (Figure 5A). We observed that different TNBC cells differed in their capacity to invade matrigel. However, the inhibitory effect of sulindac sulfide was observed in all cell lines tested. Dephosphorylated beta-catenin is the transcriptionally active form because it moves to the nucleus and is competent of initiating the transcription of its target genes. Upon activation of the WP, degradation of active cytosolic beta-catenin is blocked which then enters the nucleus to initiate the transcription of its target genes including MMP7 (Figure 10). We reported that differential activation of WP in TNBC increases MMP7, a target gene of WP involved in the degradation of matrix protein during the invasion. Hence to provide mechanistic insight into the mode of involvement of WP in fibronectin-directed matrigel invasion, we studied the effect of sulindac sulfide on the levels of active beta-catenin as well as the expression of MMP7 in TNBC cells. Sulindac sulfide treatment dose-dependently blocked active beta-catenin (Figure 5B) and decreased both the expression and activity of MMP7 (Figure 5C) in TNBC cells. The decreased levels of active beta-catenin reciprocated with the downregulation of MMP7 levels/function (casein-zymography) in HCC70 and SUM149 cells. This decrease in the MMP7 level in SUM149 cells is in line with our previously reported loss of MMP7 casein-zymographic activity as well as the relative luciferase activity (TOP-Flash over FOP-Flash) following sulindac sulfide treatment. Results show that sulindac sulfide treatment blocked the fibronectin-mediated invasion of TNBC cells via direct inhibition of the transcriptional target of active beta-catenin, MMP7 in cells which endogenously express MMP7. Interestingly, the effect of sulindac sulfide on the invasion of MDA-MB231 cells which do not express the measurable amount of MMP7 reflects the effect of sulindac sulfide on the migratory property of the cell. Using ApcMin/+ mice, a genetic model of human familial adenomatous polyposis, Guillen-Ahlers et al., reported a downregulation of MMP7 vis-\u00e0-vis reduction of tumors in sulindac-treated animals which was further validated by RT-PCR. MMP7 in their study as found in \u2018hot spot\u2019 areas within the tumors of vehicle-treated animals in contrast, was greatly diminished in those mice treated with sulindac. Data represented in Figure 5 also substantiate our previous report that the relative luciferase activity (TOP-Flash over FOP-Flash) in MDA-MB231 cells were decreased following downregulation of sulindac sulfide-mediated beta-catenin and active beta-catenin levels. We did not perform MMP7 assay in MDA-MB231 as we previously observed that the MMP7 protein expression and its enzymatic activity (by casein zymography) is negligible in MDA-MB231 cells.Effect of Sulindac sulfide treatment on fibronectin-mediated invasion (A), levels of active beta-catenin (B) and expression/function of MMP7, a transcriptional target of active beta-catenin (C) in different TNBC cellsA. Sulindac sulfide (50 \u03bcM) blocked fibronectin-mediated invasion of MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and SUM149 TNBC cells through matrigel in the transwell invasion assay (**p< 0.05; ***p< 0.0001; *p< 0.07). B. Sulindac sulfide dose-dependently (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) blocked the transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin in MDA-MB468, SUM149, HCC70 and MDA-MB231 TNBC cells. The expression of active beta-catenin was semi-quantified using ImageJ. C. Sulindac sulfide dose-dependently (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM) decreased both the levels of the MMP7 protein as well as its function (casein zymogram from secreted MMP7 in the conditioned media) in HCC70 and SUM149 TNBC cells. The expression of MMP7 protein was semi-quantified using ImageJ.Physiological stimulation of WP & Effect of WP inhibition on LWnt3ACM-stimulated metastasis-associated phenotypes in TNBC cellsIn addition to the perturbation of the WP by sulindac sulfide, we also stimulated (ligand-mediated) the WP by LWnt3ACM. Treatment of cells with LWnt3ACM increased cellular levels of beta-catenin (data not shown). To demonstrate that WP is causally responsible for the regulation of MA phenotypes in TNBC, cells were physiologically stimulated with LWnt3ACM and the effect of pharmacological modulators of different nodes of the WP (CHIR99021, WntC59, XAV939 and GDC-0941) was studied.Upregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway decreases degradation of beta-catenin via inhibition of GSK3beta (as a part of beta-catenin degradation complex). We have previously reported that pan PI3K inhibitor LY294002, as well as SF1126, blocked phosphorylation of GSK3beta in HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 TNBC cells. In agreement with the above fact, we reported that the treatment with LY294002 decreased both cellular levels of MMP7 as well as enzymatic activity (casein zymography) of MMP7 in TNBC cells indicating that inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway blocks WP signals. Accordingly, here we tested the effect of the pan-PI3K inhibitor on the LWnt3ACM-stimulated 3D clonogenic growth of TNBC cells. Figure 6A shows that LWnt3ACM-stimulated 3D clonogenic growth (96 hrs) was blocked by the pan-PI3K inhibitor, GDC-0941. We also stimulated fibronectin-directed transwell migration using LWnt3ACM and tested the effect of some WP modulating agents including sulindac sulfide, GDC-0941, WntC59 and XAV939. Figure 6B showed that LWnt3ACM-stimulated fibronectin-directed migration in TNBC cells was inhibited in the presence of WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide and GDC-0941 as well as WP modulators like WntC59 and XAV939 in BT20 cells. Since we stimulated the WP by Wnt3A, we included different inhibitors that block WP signaling from different nodes. Data showed that the downregulation of WP by, (1) decreasing receptor-ligand interaction following WntC59 (prevents palmitoylation of Wnt proteins by Porcupine, a membrane-bound O-acyltransferase and thereby blocks Wnt secretion and activity), (2) stabilizing Axin1 and Axin2 protein levels following XAV939 (a small molecule tankyrase inhibitor which enhances the degradation of the beta-catenin and attenuates Wnt-induced transcriptional activity of beta-catenin), (3) WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide and (4) PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta inhibition following GDC-0941(reduces beta-catenin levels) blocked LWnt3ACM-stimulated migration of TNBC cells on fibronectin.Effect of pan-PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941, sulindac sulfide, WntC59 and XAV939 on LWnt3ACM stimulated 3D-ON-TOP growth in MDA-MB231Red (A) and fibronectin-directed migration in BT20 (B) cellsA. GDC-0941 (1 \u03bcM) blocked LWnt3ACM stimulated 3D-ON-TOP growth at 96 hours in MDA-MB231Red TNBC cells. The \u201con plate\u201d controls were included as the internal control to show the culture condition of the survival of the cells at 96 hours as the experiments were conducted under no FBS condition. The experiments were conducted under FBS-free condition since the LWnt3ACM was collected under no FBS condition. B. Sulindac sulfide, GDC-0941, WntC59 and XAV939 abrogated LWnt3ACM stimulated fibronectin-directed migration at 24 hours in BT20 cells. Low magnification pictures were presented as insets. The distance between scratches (n=4) was semi-quantified from 10 randomly chosen fields and presented as bar-diagram where FBS-free control (C) was compared with LWnt3ACM stimulated (L). The increase in the migration in the LWnt3ACM stimulated cells (as measured by the decrease in the width of the scratches) was compared with LWnt3ACM stimulated plus sulindac sulfide (S), LWnt3ACM stimulated plus GDC-0941(G), LWnt3ACM stimulated plus WntC59 (W), LWnt3ACM stimulated plus XAV939 (X) (*p< 0.05).Effect of beta-catenin siRNA-mediated inhibition of WP on metastasis-associated phenotypes in TNBCBeta-catenin is the functional readout of WP and we have reported the functional perturbation of the WP following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA. We reported that transfection of beta-catenin siRNA decreased levels of total beta-catenin, active beta-catenin, relative luciferase activity (TOP-Flash), total protein levels of MMP7 and functional levels of MMP7 (casein zymogram). Figure 7A showed the time course of siRNA-mediated depletion of beta-catenin in HCC1937 and MDA-MB231 cells. The control lysates were obtained at the mid-point (48 hrs) of the transfection. The efficiency of the transient transfection was tested in BT20, MDA-MB231 and HCC1937 cells (Supplementary Figure S1). To test the downstream read out of the decrease of total beta-catenin levels, we also determined the effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of beta-catenin on one of the beta-catenin target genes, c-MYC. Figure 7A showed that c-MYC protein levels were decreased at both 48 and 72 hours after transfection of the siRNA as compared to their respective controls in both HCC1937 and MDA-MB231 TNBC cells confirming that the siRNA-mediated decrease in the level of beta-catenin led to the transcriptional downregulation of the WP. We next tested the effect of downregulation of beta-catenin by siRNA on the survival of HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells by cell TiterGLO (Figure 7B) (on the percentage of live cells) at 72 hours of transfection. Data showed that the survival of cells was decreased by 50% in HCC1937 cells transfected with beta-catenin siRNA as compared to the control siRNA. Similarly, 35% and 40% decrease in cell survival were observed in MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells respectively. SiRNA mediated downregulation of WP blocked both 2D (Figure 7C) and 3D (Figure 7D) clonogenic growth of TNBC cells as compared to their respective controls. The beta-catenin siRNA transfected HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells migrated significantly in lesser numbers as compared to their corresponding control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 7E) indicating that siRNA-mediated downregulation of WP blocked fibronectin-mediated migration of TNBC cells. It is worth noting that the effect of siRNA-mediated downregulation of WP on the fibronectin-mediated migration was most pronounced in PIK3CA mutated BT20 cells and PTEN null HCC1937 cells as compared to the RAS/RAF mutated MDA-MB231 cells. We next tested the effect of beta-catenin siRNA-mediated downregulation of WP on matrigel invasion in these cells. Figure 7F showed the abrogation of fibronectin-mediated matrigel invasion following transfection of beta-catenin siRNA. Interestingly enough we observed a similarity in the pattern of inhibition of the invasion of cells with that of the migration of the cells which may indicate the distinct role of migration on the invasion of a tumor cell. Since none of the HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells expressed MMP7 (in contrast to that in SUM149) as we reported previously, it is interesting to note that the effect of beta-catenin siRNA on the invasion of these cells may be mediated directly via migration and not via MMP7.SiRNA mediated downregulation of beta-catenin and c-MYC proteins in TNBC cells (A) caused a decreased cell survival (B), blocked clonogenic 2D growth (C), blocked 3D ON-TOP growth. (D), inhibited fibronectin-directed transwell migration (E) and inhibited matrigel invasion (F)A. HCC1937 and MDA-MB231 cells were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA and control siRNA for different time points. Actin was used as the loading control. c-MYC levels were determined after transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA. Downregulation of beta-catenin was tested as the reference. B. Effect of downregulation of beta-catenin was tested on the proliferation of HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells by cell TiterGLO following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA for 72 hours. Data presented as % of the live cell (*p< 0.05). C. Effect of downregulation of beta-catenin following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA was tested on the 2D clonogenic growth of HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells. D. Effect of downregulation of beta-catenin following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA was tested on the 3D clonogenic growth of HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells. Cells were plated for the clonogenic assay 24 hours following the transfection and clonogenicity were tested for 72 hours. E. Effect of downregulation of beta-catenin following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA (for 24 hours) was tested on the fibronectin-directed migration of HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells in a transwell. Migrated cells were stained with crystal violet before counting under a microscope (10 random fields) (*p< 0.05). Low-magnification images were presented as insets. F. Effect of siRNA-mediated down regulation of beta-catenin on matrigel invasion was tested in HCC1937, MDA-MB231, and BT20 cells following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours. Invaded cells were stained with crystal violet before counting under a microscope (10 random fields) (*p< 0.05).Effect of pharmacological modulators of different nodes of WP on metastasis-associated phenotypes in TNBCDifferent nodes of WP can be pharmacologically regulated. In this study, we used XAV939, an Axin1 and Axin2 stabilizing agent and WntC59, a compound that prevents palmitoylation of Wnt proteins by Porcupine, which thereby blocks Wnt ligand secretion and WP activity. Also, we have used an activator of WP. We used CHIR99021 to stimulate canonical Wnt signaling by inhibiting GSK3beta of the beta-catenin destruction complex. CHIR99021 is reported to induce a decrease in phosphorylation of beta-catenin and activation of the T-cell factor (TCF)-responsive TOP-Flash reporter, and recombinant Wnt3A has been known to replicate the effect of CHIR99021. Since we used LWnt3ACM for stimulating the WP (ligand-induced WP activation), we also decided to test the effect of the WP activator, CHIR99021 on MA phenotypes. Figure 8A showed that WP activator CHIR99021 enhanced the 3D colony formation in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and BT20. This result is in contrast to the inhibitory effect of WP antagonists WntC59 (Figure 8B) and XAV939 (Figure 8C) on the clonogenic growth of MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, SUM149 and BT20 TNBC cells. Figure 8D showed the effect of Wnt-antagonists WntC59 (10 nM) and XAV939 (5 microM) on live MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and BT20 cells by cell TiterGLO. The inhibitory effect of Wnt-antagonists was observed to be limited because of the presence of 10% FBS in the culture (to comply with the 3D clonogenic growth assay). A better inhibition of cell growth was however observed for XAV939 in cells with 2.5% FBS as reported by Bao et al.. Wnt-antagonists WntC59 and XAV939 blocked the migration of MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and BT20 cells on fibronectin (Figure 8E) and significantly abrogated matrigel invasion in HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (Figure 8F). Collectively, our data demonstrated that (1) WP activator CHIR99021, WP antagonist WntC59 and XAV939 regulated the clonogenic growth of TNBC cells in 3D ON-TOP colony formation assay (Figure 8A\u20138C), (2) WP antagonists WntC59 and XAV939 inhibited the growth of cells in cell TiterGLO assay (Figure 8D), (3) WP antagonists WntC59 and XAV939 blocked fibronectin-directed migration of cells in scratch assay (Figure 8E) and (4) WP antagonists WntC59 blocked fibronectin-directed matrigel-invasion of cells in transwell assay (Figure 8F).Effect of WP modulators on clonogenic growth (A-C), cell survival (D), fibronectin-directed migration (E) and matrigel invasion (F) in different TNBC cellsA. WP activator, CHIR99021 upregulated while B. WP antagonists WntC59 and C. XAV939 downregulated 3D ON-TOP colony formation in MDA-MB231, SUM149, BT20 and MDA-MB468 cells. Two doses of WP activator CHIR99021 (3 \u03bcM and 6 \u03bcM), WP antagonists WntC59 (1 nM and 10 nM), and XAV939 (1 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM) were tested on the clonogenic growth of TNBC cells. Photomicrograph (X4 magnification) represents pictures of live cell colonies at the day 7 of treatment. D. Effect of Wnt-antagonists WntC59 (10 nM) and XAV939 (5 \u03bcM) on live MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468 and BT20 cells were tested by cell TiterGLO. The experiment was carried out in 10% FBS conditions. The effect was found to be more pronounced under 2.5 % FBS (data not shown). Statistical significance (p values) was presented on the respective bars. E. WP antagonists WntC59 (10 nM) and XAV939 (5 \u03bcM) blocked fibronectin-directed migration in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, BT20 cells (*p< 0.05). F. WntC59 (10 nM) downregulated matrigel invasion in HCC1937, MDA-MB231 and BT20 cells (*p< 0.05).WP regulates metastasis-associated phenotypes in brain-metastasis specific TNBC cell line, MDA-MB231BRTo test the specific effect of WP in the control of metastasis in TNBC, we used brain-metastasis specific TNBC cell line, MDA-MB231BR (courtesy Dr. P. S. Steeg). In line with the studies instituted by Dr. Steeg and her colleagues, our in vivo study showed that this cell line does metastasize in the brain of immune-compromised mice (data not shown). We tested the effect of sulindac sulfide on LWnt3ACM stimulated real-time growth of live MDA-MB231BR cells. Figure 9A showed that LWnt3ACM-stimulated real-time increase in the confluence (%) of MDA-MB231BR cells was blocked dose and time dependently by the treatment with sulindac sulfide as compared to serum free controls. We also used pharmacological modulators of different nodes of WP like WntC59, XAV939, sulindac sulfide and GDC-0941 (as tested in other TNBC cell lines in this study) to demonstrate a blockade of LWnt3ACM-stimulated fibronectin-directed migration in MDA-MB231BR cells (Figure 9B). Finally to prove the direct role of the WP in the metastasis (brain) in TNBC we tested the clonogenic growth of MDA-MB231BR cells following transfection of beta-catenin siRNA and demonstrated that beta-catenin siRNA-mediated perturbation of WP also abrogated LWnt3ACM-stimulated 3D clonogenic growth in MDA-MB231BR cells (Figure 9C). The figure showed that 3D clonogenic growth of cells for 48 hours was blocked in the absence of beta-catenin following 24 hours of siRNA transfection. Pictures of the \u201con-gel\u201d control after 24 hours of siRNA transfection (lower panel) were presented for the reference.Effect of sulindac sulfide, WntC59, XAV939, GDC-0941 treatment and transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA on real-time proliferation (A), fibronectin-directed migration (B) and clonogenic 3D growth (C) of brain metastasis-directed MDA-MB231BR TNBC cellsMDA-MB231BR cells were used to test the role of the WP directly in real time proliferation A. fibronectin-directed migration B. and 3D clonogenic growth C. under different study conditions e.g. physiological stimulation of the WP by LWnt3ACM and genetic perturbation of beta-catenin following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA. (A) Sulindac sulfide blocked LWnt3ACM stimulated proliferation of cells as measured by the percentage of the confluence of cells (mean Vs time). (B) LWnt3ACM stimulated fibronectin-directed migration for 24 hours was abrogated in the presence of WP modulators, WntC59 10 nM as well as XAV939 (5 \u03bcM), sulindac sulfide (50 \u03bcM) and GDC-0941 (1 \u03bcM). C. LWnt3ACM stimulated 3D clonogenic growth for 48 hours was abrogated following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA as compared to the transfection of scrambled siRNA.DISCUSSIONMetastatic progression is the single most important cause of poor outcomes in these TNBC patients. Tumor cells in the course of their evolution acquire genetic alteration(s) that triggers their metastatic potency via deregulation of different signaling pathways which singularly or collectively activates MA phenotypes. We have previously demonstrated that the upregulation of Wnt signaling in TNBC patients is associated with metastasis which in agreement with reports from Reis-Filho's team and Khramtsov et al., clearly established that there is WP upregulation in TN subset of BC. This study is built on these reports which collectively demonstrate that the upregulation of Wnt signals is a cardinal feature of TNBC. Here we provide the mechanism based insight towards the understanding of the functional relevance of the WP in the biology of metastasizing TNBC cells. Our results demonstrated that TNBC cells acquire migratory, invasive and clonogenic properties via upregulation of WP and thus WP upregulation observed in tumors of TNBC patients as we reported earlier is functionally associated with MA phenotypes. Our data mechanistically explained how the upregulation of different components of the WP are causally associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in this subtype of BC as reported earlier.TNBC is a heterogeneous disease with different genome based sub-sets within the subtype. This heterogeneity had been known to limit the outcome of the disease by posing real challenges for identifying targets and detecting driving pathways as well as in translating TNBC gene signatures into clinics. Recently Mart\u00ednez-Revollar et al., have reported that heterogeneity between TNBC cells is due to a differential activation of Wnt and PI3K/AKT pathways. To address the inherent genetic heterogeneity of TNBC, we chose 15 different TNBC cell lines with a wide range of genetic backgrounds representing different genetic alterations in TNBC including p53 mutation, BRCA1 mutation, BRCA2 mutation, PTEN-nullness, PIK3CA mutation, RB1-mutation, RAS-RAF mutation as reported earlier. This helped us to model all major characteristic genetic alterations observed in TNBC. Our study included TNBC cell lines representing all major types of genetic alterations as mentioned in detail in the method section. We have used (1) physiological (stimulation by LWnt3A Condition Media; LWnt3ACM), (2) genetic (beta-catenin siRNA), (3) pharmacological (WP activator CHIR99021, WP antagonist WntC59, WP antagonist XAV939 and PI3K pathway inhibitor GDC-0941) and (4) mechanistic (WP signaling inhibitor, sulindac sulfide) methods to understand the functional relationship between WP and MA phenotypes in TNBC. In summary, our study involved a comprehensive testing of different modulators of WP on different nodes of WP in the context of different MA phenotypes in TNBC cells representing all major genetic-alteration-based subsets. We observed that cell lines with different genetic background did have a different response to different agents in the context of different phenotypes. For example, we observed that RAS/RAF mutated mesenchymal TNBC cell line MDA-MB231 was most effective in migrating on fibronectin as compared to PTEN null epithelial MDA-MB468 cells. This effect was reciprocated in fibronectin-dependent matrigel invasion.In our study, we have used physiological, pharmacological and genetic as well as classical cell signaling methods to stimulate and block WP, and studied the role of WP in the regulation of MA phenotypes in TNBC. The upregulation of WP leads to an enhanced transcriptional activity of beta-catenin via a canonical pathway in TNBC cells (Figure 10). In the absence of WNT signals, the rapid turnover of newly synthesized beta-catenin is orchestrated via sequestration of free cytoplasmic beta-catenin by the \u2018scaffolding/destruction\u2019 complex, consisting of Axin, APC, CK1 and GSK3beta where beta-catenin is phosphorylated for its subsequent proteasomal degradation. Binding of WNT to Frizzled triggers the recruitment (and phosphorylation) of Dishevelled (DVL) and Axin by Frizzled and the WNT co-receptor LRP respectively. GSK3beta is released from the \u2018scaffolding/destruction\u2019 complex. As a result, unphosphorylated and transcriptionally active beta-catenin moves to the nucleus where it interacts with members of the TCF and LEF family of transcription factors to induce transcription of beta-catenin's downstream target genes including c-MYC, MMP7, cyclin D1 and c-Met (http://www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/pathways/targets.html). TCF and LEF proteins act as transcriptional repressors by binding to Groucho proteins in the absence of beta-catenin (Figure 10). Our primary validation strategy was focused on beta-catenin because beta-catenin is the functional readout of WP that mediates Wnt signaling. We have used pharmacological and genetic tools to attenuate cellular levels of beta-catenin. Since the activation of the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway leads to an increase of beta-catenin protein via inhibition of its degradation and sulindac sulfide mediated loss of beta-catenin levels occurs via reactivation of proteasomal degradation, we chose sulindac sulfide for the attenuation of the pathway in order to test our hypothesis (Figure 10). Matsuda et al., inhibited the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway following ectopic expression of sFRP1 in MDA-MB231 BC cells as determined by the levels of total beta-catenin. Similarly, in our study, total beta-catenin was decreased following the administration of sulindac sulfide. Abnormal migration of tumor cells following specific integrin engagement and invasion of tumor cells through ECM are among the key phenotypic components of metastasis. Since 1) directional migration of tumor cells is one of the critical prerequisites for the metastatic behavior of TNBC and 2) Wnt-beta-catenin signaling is known to control migration of tumor cells, we studied the effect of inhibition of the WP by sulindac sulfide on fibronectin-directed migration for 24 hours in TNBC cell lines. A similar role of beta-catenin in cell migration has been demonstrated during epithelial tubulogenesis wherein the expression of DN90 and DN131 beta-catenin was found to inhibit directed cell extension and migration from MDCK cysts. We verified our results in real-time, by video microscopic recording the movement of live TNBC cells on fibronectin (supplementary movie; M1 & M2) and semi-quantifying the movement of the cells (from the image analyses of the Time-lapsed images) following sulindac sulfide (50 microM) administration in scratch-wound healing assay (Figure 2E). Beta-catenin is a multifunctional protein that performs many functions in a cell including E-cadherin-mediated adhesion, and in membrane extensions. Intracellularly E-cadherin is linked to catenins (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-catenin/plakoglobin), which connect E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton. Inhibitory effect of sulindac sulfide on fibronectin-directed migration was in agreement with the alterations of the cytoarchitecture of filamentous actin (Figure 3) and podia characteristics of TNBC cells (Figure 4). Beta-catenin forms an adhesion complex with E-cadherins, alpha-catenin as well as actin and this adhesion complex is important for the membrane translocation of beta-catenin. Interestingly, we observed an inverse correlation between E-cadherin expression and fibronectin-mediated migration in different TNBC cells (Supplementary Figure S3). TNBC cells expressing comparatively low levels of E-cadherin (HCC1937, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB468, and Hs578t) exhibit higher migratory responses as compared to the high E-cadherin-expressing TNBC cells (HCC70 and BT20) (Supplementary Figure S3). Our observed differential expression of E-cadherin in TNBC cell lines is in agreement with Sommers, et al., who also reported a lack of expression of this protein in MDA-MB231, MDA-MB436, BT549, and Hs578t. E-cadherin has been termed an \u201cinvasion suppressor\u201d while activated beta-catenin stimulates motility of epithelial cells. Participation of E-cadherin in the WP was suggested because of the dual role of beta-catenin in cell adhesion and the Wnt signaling pathway. Beta-catenin interacts at the cell membrane with the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin while it activates Wnt target genes in the nucleus. The intracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with the actin cytoskeleton via a protein complex containing alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and gamma-catenin. Thus, the inverse relationship between E-cadherin expression and TNBC cell migration observed in our results may substantiate the fact that the existing role of WP in TNBC is functionally connected to the actin cytoskeleton. In the light of above discussion, our data raise the obvious question regarding the role of canonical and non-canonical WP in mediating MA phenotypes in TNBC.WP controls metastasis-associated phenotypes in TNBCThe Wnt signaling pathway is activated following the binding of extracellular Wnt ligands (often secreted by the cell) to Frizzled transmembrane receptors. Canonical Wnt signaling causes the activation of beta-catenin-TCF complexes leading to the transcriptional activation of beta-catenin target genes (as stated in the discussion).A direct involvement of WP in the regulation of MA phenotypes, fibronectin-directed migration, invasion and 3D-clonogenic growth was inferred from the result of both perturbation of WP and stimulation of WP that was carried out finally in the brain metastasis-specific MDA-MB231BR TNBC cells. Our data collectively provided a direct causal relationship between WP upregulation and metastasis in TNBC cells. Considering the clinical impact of the aggressive nature of TNBC on the outcome in patients, our data will be worthwhile to consider for establishing biomarkers in this subtype of BC especially in the metastatic setting. Interestingly, in an article of November 2015 Zhang et al., reported that PTEN loss primes brain metastasis outgrowth in subtypes of BC. Their study demonstrated that an adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumor cells led to a reciprocal enhancement of the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumor cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Dysregulated PI3K/AKT and WNT/CTNNB1 signaling in the development and progression of metastatic tumor is mediated via a direct inhibition of beta-catenin degradation following the inhibition of GSK3beta. LWnt3ACM-stimulated integrin-directed migration of brain metastasis-specific MDA-MB231BR cells was inhibited following GDC-0941 treatment (Figure 9B) in our study. Also an inhibitor of GSK3beta, CHIR99021 has been shown to enhance the 3D clonogenic growth of different TNBC cells including BT20, which expresses the WNT3 and the WNT7B oncogenes (Figure 8A). We have previously identified that the functional upregulation of secreted-MMP7, a transcriptional target of WP in TNBC is associated with the loss of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene whose loss has been found to be the most common first event associated with basal-like subtype and this PI3K-AKT pathway activating event due to a deletion/mutation/loss of PTEN frequently (35%) occurs in TNBC. A synergistic effect of PTEN loss and WNT/CTNNB1 signaling pathway activation has been reported in tumor development and progression. Thus, it is possible that an adaptive loss of PTEN may be functionally responsible for the upregulation of WP during the process of metastatic progression of triple negative breast tumor cells in the brain. It remains to identify however the exact functional relationship between the adaptive loss of PTEN in TNBC tumor cells those are destined for brain metastasis and the upregulation of WP. Recently various unconventional and novel agents have been tested experimentally for their ability to suppress metastatic TNBC including models of metastases to the brain. Our data provides first experimental evidence to consider the role of the WP as an effective new target for the future development of anti-metastasis therapies in TNBC, especially in the context of brain metastasis and highlights the importance of the WP in the search of novel treatment as well as identification of collective biomarkers in metastatic TNBC.MATERIALS AND METHODSData analyses using cBioPortalWe studied alterations (amplification, deep deletion, missense mutation, mRNA upregulation, mRNA downregulation, protein upregulation and protein downregulation) in CTNNB1, APC and DVL1 genes in Breast Invasive Carcinoma (TCGA, 2012) case set and Invasive Ductal Cancers (brca/tcga/pub2015) case set using c-BioPortal (figure 1 & S5).

TNBC cell line BT20 which expresses the WNT3 and the WNT7B oncogenes were used. To test a direct involvement of WP in metastasis in TNBC, we used EGFP-tagged brain metastasis-specific cell line, MDA-MB231BR (A kind gift from Dr. P. S. Steeg; Women's Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). All BC cell lines except SUM102, SUM149 and Herceptin (trastuzumab) resistant BT474HER (BTH) cell lines were obtained from ATCC. SUM102 and SUM149 cells were obtained from Asterand (Partners in human tissue research). Herceptin resistant BT474 cell was obtained from Dr. Mark Pegram (Div. Hemat. & Med. Oncology, UCLA, CA). Antibodies including tubulin (BD Biosciences, CA), actin, c-MYC, beta-catenin, and MMP7 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) were used for the study. WP modulators, CHIR99021, WntC59 and XAV939 were procured from Cellagen Technology.GDC-0941 was procured from selleckchem.com. Sulindac sulfide was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.Biochemical analysisWe performed immunoblots by Western blots on the equivalent amounts of protein (Bradford assay) using clarified cell lysates as mentioned earlier. Cell lysates were assayed for total protein using BSA as standard. Normalized clarified lysates (25-50 \u03bcg protein) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Membranes are immunoblotted with different primary antibodies before individual bands on nitrocellulose membranes were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, UK) using UVP.Integrin-directed migration and invasion assaysHaptotaxis and wound healing assays were performed to test fibronectin-directed migration of tumor cells. Haptotaxis and matrigel-invasion were carried out using transwell migration chambers. An adhesion assay on fibronectin was performed simultaneously with the haptotaxis assay under similar conditions. In vitro wound healing migration assays were performed (scratch assay) as previously described by our group.Actin dynamics and podia-parametersTNBC cells were plated on fibronectin and treated with sulindac sulfide under conditions similar to that of the migration experiments. Cells were processed for Phalloidin-555 staining for filamentous actin. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cells were photographed using a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope with a 63 x (1.4-numerical-aperture) or 40 x (1.4-numerical-aperture) Plan-Apochromat oil objective as mentioned earlier. Lamellipodia/cell and filopodia/cell were identified under a confocal microscope. For the semi-quantification purpose, an equal number of cells from the control and treated experiments exhibiting, at least, one filopodia were chosen from randomly selected fields, and their screenshot images were collected. A total number of lamellipodia/cell and filopodia/cell from the control, as well as treated groups, were counted manually from these screenshot confocal images.Real-time migration of live TNBC cellsDigitized bright-field time-lapse real-time images of the movement of MDA-MB231 cells (placed in live-cell imaging chambers) into the scratched area (for migration assay) were acquired with a Perkin Elmer Ultraview ERS (Norwalk, CT) disk-spinning confocal system, mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. To account for the axial focal changes of cells as they move, optical Z-sections were collected at 0.95 \u03bcm interval spacing (Movies: Supplementary data M1 & M2).Motility descriptors of real-time movement of live TNBC cellsImage analysis was carried out to measure the motility from the time-lapse images of the effect of sulindac sulfide on the fibronectin-directed migration of the TNBC cells in the scratch-wound assay on fibronectin. Nuclear tracking paths of migrating cells were shown as track overlays. The trajectory of the movement of cells is characterized by two quantitative motility descriptors (average velocity and MRDO, maximum relative distance from the origin). The position of the nucleus is taken as the point of \u201corigin\u201d. Time-lapse images are acquired with a Perkin Elmer Ultraview ERS confocal system. Bright-field images are acquired with a Hamamatsu Orca-ER camera (10x objective) at 10 minutes intervals.Casein zymographyEnzymatic activity of the secreted MMP7 from the conditioned media was determined by zymography using Bio-Rad precast casein gels as described earlier.Cell survival and proliferation assayThe cell survival assay was performed using cell Titer-GLO luminescent cell viability assay kit as per manufacturer's direction (Promega). The real-time proliferation of GFP positive MDA-MB231BR cells was performed using time-lapse imaging without labels (IncuCyte; ESSEN BioScience). Using live cells we generated long-term growth and growth inhibition curves and monitored morphology. The time course of the percentage of the confluence of LWnt3ACM stimulated GFP positive MDA-MB231BR cells (Mean Vs time) was represented by four days following two doses of sulindac sulfide (25 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM).Clonogenic 3D ON-TOP assayAppropriate three-dimensional (3D) culture provides a more physiologically relevant approach to the analysis of gene function and cell phenotype ex vivo. We tested the involvement of WP in 3D ON-TOP cultures of the laminin-rich extracellular matrix as many of the crucial micro-environmental cues are restored using this form of culture as previously described.LWnt3A conditioned mediaLWnt3A conditioned medium was obtained from the LWnt-3A (ATCC\u00ae CRL-2647\u2122) cells. These L-M(TK-) cells were transfected with a Wnt-3A expression vector and stable clones were selected in medium containing G418. The Wnt3A gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein. The cells are engineered to secrete biologically active Wnt3A protein. We used these cells as our source for production of Wnt3A conditioned medium (Wnt3ACM) (as described by the ATCC). L Cell (ATCC\u00ae CRL2648\u2122) was used as the parental line for the LWnt3A cell line.LWnt3ACM stimulation following transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNAThe transient transfection of beta-catenin siRNA was performed as reported before. GFP-positive MDA-MB231BR cells were either not transfected or transiently transfected with scrambled siRNA or beta-catenin siRNA for 24 hours. After 24 hours, cells were plated (zero hours on-gel control) for 3D clonogenic growth for 48 hours. Pictures of zero hours on-gel control for not transfected scrambled siRNA transfected and beta-catenin siRNA transfected MDA-MB231BR cells were presented for the reference. Pictures of live cells in 3D culture were taken using Olympus DP72 microscope. Since the LWnt3ACM was obtained under FBS-free conditions, the control in these experiments represents FBS-free controls. For the clonogenic study, cells were transiently transfected with beta-catenin siRNA. Following 24 hours of transfection cells were plated for the 2D and 3D clonogenic assays.Statistical analysisEach experiment was independently repeated 4-5 times. The Student t-test was used to evaluate differences observed between treated groups and vehicle treated controls for other experiments. Data presented in the graphs represent the Mean \u00b1 S.D. of results. The minimum level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Inter-group comparison was made with a paired two-sample (Student t-test). Phenotypic experiments are performed in quadruplets.SUPPLEMENTARY FIGURES AND MOVIESCONFLICTS OF INTERESTThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.FUNDINGWe acknowledge Avera Cancer Institute,

Inhibition of this pathway represents a novel method to improve breast cancer outcomes.BackgroundBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and the second most common overall, causing ~600,000 deaths annually worldwide. Breast cancers are classified clinically into different molecular subtypes, based mainly on expression of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2, and this classification defines suitable therapeutic options, including agents targeting oestrogen or HER2 function. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC), which make up ~15% of breast cancers, do not express these markers, and accordingly cytotoxic chemotherapy is the only appropriate systemic therapy. However, TNBC outcomes are relatively poor despite this aggressive treatment.The tumour microenvironment has potent and complex influences on breast cancer behaviour. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major cellular component of breast tumour microenvironment, and have been shown to promote cancer proliferation, invasion and metastases through paracrine signalling pathways, such as secretion of VEGF, FGF2, TGF\u03b2, CXCL12 and IL6, as well as indirectly through modifications to extracellular matrix. Accordingly, the presence of CAFs is significantly associated with poor outcomes from breast cancer generally, and in TNBC specifically. An alternative explanation for this correlation is that CAFs directly influence therapy response, potentially inducing therapy resistance. The predominant model that links CAFs to therapy response involves CAF-modified extracellular matrix that changes physical tissue properties and therefore drug permeability. Direct paracrine influences of CAFs on therapeutic response, particularly to cytotoxic chemotherapy in TNBCs, have received relatively little study. Interestingly, some CAF-secreted paracrine mediators of chemotherapy response in TNBC have been identified, for example FGF5 and CXCL12 have been shown to promote resistance to docetaxel in mouse-models and to paclitaxel in 3D-culture models respectively. Identification of specific examples of molecular crosstalk between CAFs and TNBC cancer cells, such as these, presents opportunities for inhibition of the interactions and therefore chemo-sensitisation to improve TNBC outcomes. Our hypothesis was that CAFs directly modulate responses of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy, and therefore that the differential responses of tumours may be driven in part by impact of variable CAF activity. We aimed to identify molecules responsible for such cellular crosstalk and to determine whether the signalling could be inhibited to improve chemotherapy responses.MethodsEthics and patientsEthical permissions for use of fibroblasts from breast cancer resections, and of archival tissue and associated clinicopathological data from patients was granted by Leeds (East) REC (references: 09/H1326/108, 06/Q1206/180). Patients were diagnosed and treated within Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust; they were recruited, and informed consent was taken in line with these permissions. For tissue microarrays, patients were diagnosed between 01/01/2008 and 30/03/2013; inclusion criteria were clinically defined as ER, PR, HER2 negative, lack of neoadjuvant therapies, availability of suitable archival (FFPE) tumour tissue, and availability of at least 2 months follow up.ReagentsEpirubicin hydrochloride (Sigma; St Louis, USA); recombinant IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 (Peprotech; Rocky Hill, USA); mouse anti-human IFN Type I R2 antibody (#MMHAR-2; PBL Assay Science; Piscataway, USA); goat anti-human IFN Type II R1 antibody, mouse IgG2A control, goat IgG control (#AF673, #MAB00, #AB-108-C 3; R&D Systems; Minneapolis, USA); rabbit anti-IFN\u03b21 and anti-claudin-3 antibodies (#PA5-20390, #PA5-16867; ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA); rabbit monoclonal MX1 antibody (#D3W7I; CST; MA, USA).Tissue cultureMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-157 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and MDA-MB-231-luc from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, USA). Cells that stably express GFP and firefly luciferase (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc), or GFP (MDA-MB-468-GFP) were developed by transduction with lentiviruses. Breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were extracted from breast cancer resections from >1\u2009cm outside tumour margins, or from inside tumour masses, respectively. Fibroblasts were used as primary lines (passage 5\u201310), or immortalised by viral transduction to over-express hTERT. CAF-GFP cells were developed by lentiviral transduction. Cells were cultured (37\u2009\u00b0C) in media from Thermofisher (Waltham, USA) with 10% FCS (Sigma; St Louis, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (final concentrations 100 U/ml and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and immortalised fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM. Primary fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM-F12 and 5\u2009\u03bcg/ml Fungizone (Sigma; St Louis, USA). MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15. Cells were cultured in 5% CO2/air incubators, except for MDA-MB-157 (sealed flasks in 100% air). Cells were transfected in OptiMEM without serum using Lipofectamine-2000 (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). ISRE/GAS reporter plasmids and renilla plasmid (pRL-TK) were gifts from Andrew Macdonald (Leeds, UK).Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)FACS was performed on cells from co-cultures or from matched monocultures to allow separate assessment of epithelial and fibroblast components by either colony forming assays or expression analyses. Cells were removed from culture dishes using trypsin/EDTA (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA) and resuspended in RPMI phenol red free media (Thermofisher; Waltham, USA). An Influx 6-way cell sorter (BDBiosciences; San Jose, USA) was used to identify GFP positive cells (488\u2009nm laser), gating on live cells on FSC/SSC. Typically, ~100,000 single cells of either GFP positive, GFP negative or both separately were collected into ice-cold RPMI phenol red free media. Representative flow plots showing three different co-cultures (MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc and CAF; MDA-MB-468-GFP and CAF; MDA-MB-157 and CAF-GFP) are shown (Fig. S1).Luciferase assaysLuciferase assays (survival assays\u2014firefly only; reporter assays\u2014dual) were performed using Promega (Madison, USA) reagents and were quantified by plate reader (Mithras-LB940, Berthold; Bad Wildbad, Germany). For survival assays, epirubicin-treated readings were normalised to untreated cultures of the same fibroblast-epithelial proportions to determine relative survival excluding differences in epithelial cell numbers from the differing proportions. For reporter assays, MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse transfected with ISRE or GAS reporters (firefly) and pRL-TK control (renilla) for 18\u2009h and were then replated in culture/co-culture with varying proportions of CAFs. Firefly activity was normalised to renilla.Colony forming (clonogenic) assaysMono-/co-cultures were established and treated with drugs/controls as described in figure legends. To determine survival in monoculture experiments (for example, recombinant IFN treatments), cells were resuspended in fresh medium lacking drugs or IFNs and replated in technical duplicate 10\u2009cm dishes at 500 cells per plate. Plates were incubated for 14 days undisturbed. Cells were then fixed/stained using Crystal Violet (Sigma; St Louis, USA) in 50% methanol/20% ethanol. Isolated colonies (>40 cells) were counted manually. For experiments involving co-culture, all cultures (including 0% fibroblast/100% epithelial cultures) were sorted to isolate epithelial cells, which were then replated and assessed as above. Reproducibility of colony counts was confirmed: plates representing a range of different colony numbers were counted by two independent scorers; counts were compared; R2 correlation coefficient was 0.949, indicating near perfect agreement.RNA analysesFor genome-wide transcriptome analyses, 900,000 MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were sorted and RNA was prepared (ReliaPrep RNA minipreps; Promega; Madison, USA). Affymetrix Clariom D microarray (Santa Clara, USA) analyses were performed by Paul Heath (Sheffield University, UK). Affymetrix transcriptome analysis console v3.0 was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (fold changes\u2009>\u2009\u00b12, ANOVA p\u2009<\u20090.05). Genes identified were analysed in ToppGene (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) using ToppFun. For qPCR of mRNAs, the GoTaq 2-Step RT-qPCR system was used with random primers and GoScript RT (Promega; Madison, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. qPCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR master mix and CXR reference dye in technical duplicates or triplicates using QuantStudio5 (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA) with SYBR settings. Primers were supplied by IDT (Coralville, USA): OAS1 (#74007036), MX1 (#74007039), IFNA2 (#74849839), IFNB1 (#74849836), IFNG (#74849833), ACTB (#74007033). For qPCR of miRNAs, TaqMan miRNA assays were used following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). qPCR was performed in technical triplicates using QuantStudio5 with TaqMan settings. Assays were supplied by ThermoFisher (Waltham, USA): miR-155-5p (#4427975), RNU48 (#4427975) Expression was determined relative to ACTB (mRNA) or RNU48 (miRNA) using \u03b4\u03b4ct.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)TMAs were constructed as previously. In brief, suitable tissue areas (tumour with stroma, avoiding poorly cellular areas, necrosis, sclerosis) were identified on haematoxylin/eosin stained slides by histopathologist LMW and three separate 0.6\u2009mm cores of tumour tissue were taken from resection blocks and inserted into grids in recipient wax blocks. Clinicopathological data were collected (Table\u00a0S1); disease-free survival was defined as time from diagnosis with primary cancer to diagnosis of recurrence, or for those without an event, to last disease-free follow up. IHC was performed broadly as previously. In brief, 5-\u03bcm sections were taken onto SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel-Glaser; Braunschweig, Germany). Sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated with absolute ethanol, and washed in running tap water. Antigens were heat retrieved in 10\u2009mM citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) using a 900\u2009W microwave (10\u2009min, high power). Slides were treated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, USA) followed by washes in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) and incubation in antibody diluent (ThermoFisher; Waltham, USA). Antibodies were diluted in antibody diluent at 1:800 (IFN\u03b21), 1:500 (claudin-3) or 1:50 (MX1) and were incubated on slides overnight (4\u2009\u00b0C). Antibody diluent only was used for no primary controls. Slides were washed with TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20; Sigma; St Louis, USA) and TBS. SignalStain Boost IHC detection Reagent (HRP) and DAB substrate (Cell Signalling Technology; MA, USA) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Slides were counterstained with Mayer\u2019s Haematoxylin, followed by washing in running tap water, Scott\u2019s water and again in running tap water. Slides were mounted under coverslips in DPX (Fluka; Gillingham, UK). Stained sections were digitally scanned using ScanScopeXT (20x) and manually scored using Webscope (Aperio; Vista, CA, USA) with protocols developed by AMH (consultant breast histopathologist). For IFN\u03b21, intensity of fibroblast staining was scored as 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For MX1, tumour cell cytoplasmic intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) or 3 (strong). For claudin-3, staining of tumour cell cytoplasm/membrane was scored as negative or positive. For each antibody, only intensity was scored since proportions of cells staining at these intensities were consistently the vast majority of cells, therefore proportion was not informative. All cores were scored by SJJ, with 10% scored by a second independent scorer (AMH) to allow for statistical analysis of scoring reproducibility. Interscorer concordance was determined using Cohen\u2019s Kappa statistics: 0.725 (MX1), 0.672 (IFN\u03b21) and 1 (claudin-3), indicating near perfect, excellent or perfect agreement. For MX1 and IFN\u03b21, scores for individual cases were means of the core scores for that case, and expression was dichotomised into high and low groups using ROC analyses. For claudin-3, cores for each case were consistently positive or negative, therefore dichotomisation was positive in all or negative in all.StatisticsData were analysed in Prism (v8) (GraphPad; San Diego, USA), except for IHC correlations and survival analyses, which were performed using SPSS (v19) (SPSS; Chicago, USA).ResultsBreast CAFs, but not NFs, consistently protect MDA-MB-231 cells from chemotherapyBreast CAFs, but not NFs, protect some TNBC lines from chemotherapy.a MDA-MB-231-luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs (left panel) or CAFs (right panel). Cultures were treated with three different doses of epirubicin as shown, or with vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Cultures were incubated for a further 48\u2009h in fresh medium, before survival of MDA-MB-231 was assessed using luciferase assays. Data represent survival after epirubicin relative to matched vehicle control cultures, and are means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental replicates. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (top panels) or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells (bottom panels) were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of immortalised breast NFs or CAFs. Cultures were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts (left panels) or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts after epirubicin relative to matched untreated cultures; right panels). Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or with increasing proportions of primary (p) breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative breast cancer resection. Cultures, cells and data were treated as for part B. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) of technical duplicates from one experimental repeat. Statistics: linear regression was carried out for analyses in A and B, with selected significant differences in the overall trend across the fibroblast proportions shown (ns not significant). ANOVA tests were performed in addition; these also demonstrated that CAFs provided significant protection from epirubicin in MDA-MB-231 cells (p\u2009<\u20090.01; lowest dose Fig.\u00a01a and Fig.\u00a01b right panel) and not in MDA-MB-468 cells.Our first aim was to determine whether breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) or CAFs were able to influence sensitivity of TNBC cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Initially, we used a short-term co-culture survival assay with luciferase-expressing variants of the TNBC cell line, MDA-MB-231. These were cultured alone (0% fibroblasts) or were co-cultured with either immortalised breast NFs or CAFs in proportions ranging 8\u201355% fibroblasts. The same total cell number was seeded in each case to achieve comparable overall confluency. Cultures were treated for 24\u2009h with different doses of the anthracycline epirubicin, which is typically used in breast cancer chemotherapy, or with vehicle control; doses approximated to EC50, EC20 and EC10. Relative epithelial cell survival was assessed using luciferase assays (Fig.\u00a01a). As expected, epirubicin reduced epithelial survival dose-dependently (compare y-axis positions for different drug doses with 0% fibroblast cultures). The presence of CAFs significantly protected epithelial cells from chemotherapy at the lowest dose of drug (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and showed trends for similar protection at both higher doses (p\u2009=\u20090.057 and p\u2009=\u20090.058), with increasing proportions of CAFs giving increasing protection. Notably, 55% CAFs provided complete protection from the lowest epirubicin dose. NFs, however, showed no significant protection at any dose.Next, we extended this using an alternative end-point assay, clonogenic survival assays. These assays are more sensitive to lesser degrees of chemotherapy-induced damage, as for cells to count as \u2018having survived\u2019 they must be capable of repeated cell divisions. As before, we seeded cultures of TNBC cells either alone or with increasing proportions of breast NFs or CAFs. We used MDA-MB-231 cells, or a second TNBC line, MDA-MB-468, both of which had been transduced to over-express GFP. Cultures were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control for 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then separated from fibroblasts by cell sorting on GFP fluorescence and were replated to assess clonogenic potential. Importantly, cultures without fibroblasts were also sorted to allow proper comparison with cells from co-cultures. Data are expressed both as numbers of colonies (Fig.\u00a01b, left), and relative survival after epirubicin (colony numbers after epirubicin treatment relative to matched untreated cultures; Fig.\u00a01b, right). First, it is worth highlighting an unexpected observation in the colony number data in the absence of epirubicin. Although not significant (p\u2009=\u20090.087), clonogenicity of MDA-MB-231 cells increased after co-culture with increasing proportions of CAFs, while NFs significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.038). CAFs did not confer this increased clonogenicity on MDA-MB-468 cells, although NFs significantly decreased clonogenicity (p\u2009=\u20090.04). We concluded that fibroblasts influenced epithelial clonogenicity in a manner unrelated to chemotherapy response. Next, focusing on chemotherapy responses, epirubicin reduced clonogenic survival by ~50% in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells in the absence of fibroblasts (Fig.\u00a01b, right; note y-axis position of open bars). CAFs, but not NFs, significantly protected MDA-MB-231s from epirubicin in a proportion-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.027), with the greatest proportion of CAFs increasing survival to 83% compared to <50% without CAFs. However, CAFs did not protect MDA-MB-468 cells. Moreover, we repeated this experiment with MDA-MB-231 cells and a matched pair of primary breast NFs or CAFs cultured from a triple negative cancer mastectomy specimen (Fig.\u00a01c). We again found that CAFs, but not NFs, provided dramatic protection from chemotherapy.CAF-induced chemotherapy protection is associated with upregulation of epithelial IFN signallingCAFs stimulate IFN signalling in some co-cultured breast epithelial cell lines.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone (0%) or with CAFs (20%) and were treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Three separate biological repeats were performed giving three pairs of samples. Gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix Clariom D microarrays, and comparisons were made between 0% and 20% groups using hierarchical clustering. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc or MDA-MB-468-GFP cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAFs (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. c MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured on their own (0%) or in combination with CAF-GFP cells (20%), with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Epithelial cells were collected by FACS and RNA was prepared. Relative expression of interferon response genes OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 was determined using qPCR. b, c Data represent the mean of technical triplicates (\u00b1SD) from one biological experiment, apart from miR-155 analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells, which is from three biological experiments (\u00b1SE) and is analysed using two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests (selected significant difference shown).Our next aim was to identify gene expression changes induced by CAFs in MDA-MB-231 cells that could be responsible for CAF-induced chemoresistance. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured on their own (0% fibroblasts) or with 20% immortalised CAFs, were treated with epirubicin, and epithelial cells were collected by cell sorting, exactly as previously. RNA was extracted. This experiment was performed three times over separate weeks to provide robust biological replicates, and gene expression was profiled in the three pairs of samples. Supervised hierarchical clustering was performed to display differences in epithelial expression between the conditions (Fig.\u00a02a), demonstrating that triplicates within each group were similar, and that substantial differences between groups were evident. Paired ANOVA tests were performed to identify significant differences in gene expression of at least 2-fold; 127 genes were significantly more highly expressed in cultures with 20% CAFs, while 57 were more highly expressed in 0% CAF cultures. To define molecular pathways involved, all 184 differentially expressed genes were analysed for pathway enrichment using ToppGene. The most significantly over-represented pathway was interferon (IFN) signalling, with 12 of the 69 genes annotated as pathway components by the analysis platform included in our input of 184 (p\u2009=\u20095.1\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u221213). The 12 differentially expressed IFN-related genes are listed with fold changes in each replicate in Table\u00a0S2; these included canonical IFN-target genes MX1 and OAS1, which were upregulated at least 15-fold by CAFs in all three replicates. It was also notable that miR-155, a downstream target of and positive-feedback regulator of IFN signaling, was similarly upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs (18.6-fold, \u00b1SD 2.5), as determined by qPCR using the same input RNAs. Overall, these data suggest that IFN signalling was upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells by CAFs during epirubicin treatment.Next, we examined whether CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN-related genes differed with or without epirubicin. Therefore, cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with or without CAFs were established as before, and treated with either epirubicin or with vehicle control, and qPCR was used to assess relative expression of IFN-regulated genes MX1, OAS1 and miR-155 in epithelial cells (Fig.\u00a02b upper panels). We also assessed whether expression of these markers was influenced by CAFs in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a02b lower panels). OAS1, MX1 and miR-155 all demonstrated dramatic CAF-induced upregulation in MDA-MB-231s, with expression potentially further increased by epirubicin treatment (although the effect of epirubicin was not statistically significant). In contrast, MDA-MB-468 showed no CAF-dependent induction, with only minor variation in low basal levels (note the reduced y-axis scale). We concluded that these two cell lines showed differential abilities to respond to CAF-dependent upregulation of IFN signalling, which mirrored their abilities to receive CAF-dependent protection from epirubicin (Fig.\u00a01).MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 can be classified as claudin-low or claudin-high, respectively. In order to test whether effects of CAFs were potentially related to claudin subtype, the experiment was repeated with a second claudin-low TNBC line, MDA-MB-157. MDA-MB-157s were cultured alone, or with 20% CAFs, and treated with epirubicin or control as before. Epithelial cells were again purified by cell sorting and expression of IFN markers was measured by qPCR (Fig.\u00a02c). Expression in MDA-MB-157 cells was very similar to MDA-MB-231s, with CAF-dependent activation of all three genes. We concluded that CAFs were capable of upregulating IFN signalling in both representatives of claudin-low TNBCs.IFN\u03b21 is upregulated in CAFs after co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cellsEpithelial:fibroblast crosstalk induces IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and IFN signalling in epithelial cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, breast CAFs were cultured alone, or co-cultures of MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells and CAFs were established (80% epithelial cells with 20% fibroblasts: \u201c20%\u201d). CAFs used were either immortalised, left, or primary, right. Cultures were treated with or without 10\u2009nM epirubicin for 24\u2009h. All cultures were processed for cell sorting, allowing separation of CAFs and MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells from the co-cultures on the basis of GFP fluorescence in the CAFs. RNA was extracted, and qPCR used to determine relative expression of IFN\u03b21. Data represent the mean of duplicate culture wells (\u00b1SD) for one biological experiment. ND not detected. b MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with ISRE or GAS reporter plasmids driving firefly luciferase expression, and a control plasmid (pRL-TK; HSV thymidine kinase promoter driving renilla luciferase). Transfected MDA-MB-231 cells were then cultured on their own or with different proportions of immortalised NFs or CAFs for 24\u2009h with 10\u2009nM epirubicin. Dual luciferase assays were performed, with firefly readings normalised to renilla readings. Data represent means (\u00b1SD) for triplicate wells, for one biological experiment.Based on these data, our next hypothesis was that CAFs secrete IFNs, stimulating chemoresistance in receptive cells. Therefore, we tested whether we could detect IFN expression using qPCR for IFN\u03b12, IFN\u03b21 or IFN\u03b3. Monocultures of MDA-MB-231 or CAFs, and co-cultures of MDA-MB-231 and CAFs were established and were treated with epirubicin or vehicle control as before. Co-cultures were separated, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as previously, to provide purified epithelial and fibroblast samples derived from the co-culture, while the monocultures were also sorted to allow comparison. IFN\u03b12 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, while it was expressed at levels bordering on the limit of detection in CAFs (consequently, there is substantial technical variation); levels in CAFs did not appear to respond to either epirubicin treatment or the presence of epithelial cells (Fig. S2A). Similarly, IFN\u03b3 was expressed at very low levels; in CAFs, levels again did not appear to respond to either epirubicin or co-culture, while in MDA-MB-231 cells IFN\u03b3 was at least detectable in most samples (Fig. S2B). IFN\u03b21 was undetectable in MDA-MB-231 cells under all conditions, and in CAFs in monoculture without epirubicin (Fig.\u00a03a, left). However, CAFs were stimulated to express detectable IFN\u03b21 levels by either epirubicin or co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells, while epirubicin-treated co-cultures showed dramatic upregulation in CAFs to levels more than three orders of magnitude higher than any detected expression of IFN\u03b12 or IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, we repeated this analysis of IFN\u03b21 using primary breast CAFs (Fig.\u00a03a, right). Co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells also stimulated a dramatic increase in IFN\u03b21 expression in primary CAFs (pCAFs), although epirubicin had little additional effect. We concluded that co-culture with MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated breast CAFs to produce IFN\u03b21, which may act back on epithelial cells to upregulate IFN signalling (see Fig.\u00a02).CAFs, but not NFs, stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cellsTo confirm that this signalling crosstalk was specific to CAFs, we used IFN activity luciferase reporters in MDA-MB-231 co-cultured with either NFs or CAFs. MDA-MB-231s were transiently transfected with luciferase reporters for activity of ISREs (representing type I IFN signalling) or GAS elements (representing type II IFN signalling), before being placed in monoculture (0% fibroblasts), or co-culture with increasing proportions of either immortalised NFs or CAFs, and treated with epirubicin. Relative luciferase activities were determined (Fig.\u00a03b). NFs did not stimulate either reporter, whereas CAFs induced a proportion-dependent upregulation of both ISRE and GAS activity of up to 30-fold. We concluded that CAFs stimulate IFN signalling in co-cultured MDA-MB-231 cells, but NFs lack this ability.Recombinant IFNs are sufficient to protect MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells, but not MDA-MB-468 cells from chemotherapyRecombinant IFNs are sufficient to stimulate chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells.a MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured with a range of doses of IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with 10\u2009nM epirubicin, or control, and redosed with IFNs. Clongenic survival was determined as previously. b MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc, MDA-468-GFP or MDA-MB-157 cells were cultured with IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 (2500\u2009pg/ml and 1500\u2009pg/ml, respectively) separately or combination or with appropriate isotype control antibodies for 24\u2009h. Cells were then treated with epirubicin for 24\u2009h (10\u2009nM or, for MDA-MB-157s, 25\u2009nM). Clongenic survival was determined as previously. a, b Data are shown as either colony counts (left), or survival relative to untreated (right) and represent means (\u00b1SE) of either 3 (a) or 2 (b) independent experiments. ANOVA tests were performed and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Our next aim was to determine whether upregulation of IFN signalling in claudin-low TNBC cells was sufficient to induce chemoprotection. To test this, initially we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of doses of a type I IFN (IFN\u03b1, which signals through the same pathway as IFN\u03b21 identified above) or a type II IFN (IFN\u03b3) and determined epirubicin sensitivity using clonogenic survival assays as previously (Fig.\u00a04a). Both IFNs recapitulated effects seen by co-culture with CAFs, in that both provided significant dose-dependent protection from epirubicin (p\u2009<\u20090.001). It is interesting to note that both also appeared to increase clonogenicity in the absence of epirubicin (Fig.\u00a04a, left), as was seen previously with CAFs (Fig.\u00a01b, upper left).Next, we examined effects of recombinant IFN\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3 individually, or in combination, on chemoresponse of MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157 or MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig.\u00a04b). IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 again provided significant chemoprotection to MDA-MB-231 cells, with additive effects when in combination (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Similarly, in MDA-MB-157 cells, IFN\u03b1 and the combination, although not IFN\u03b3 alone, provided significant protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, there was no significant change in chemoresponse in MDA-MB-468 cells. We concluded that IFNs were sufficient to protect both claudin-low TNBC cell lines, and therefore IFNs were strong candidate mediators of CAF-dependent protection.IFN\u03b21 expression in CAFs and tumour cell expression of MX1 correlate with each other and with poor survival after chemotherapy in TNBC patientsIn primary cancers, IFN\u03b21 in CAFs and MX1 in cancer cells correlate with each other and with poor survival.TMAs of tissue from 109 TNBC resections were assembled and expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 and claudin-3 in tumour cells was determined using immunohistochemistry. a Representative images of immunohistochemistry, showing tissue scored \u20183\u2019 for IFN\u03b2 in fibroblasts (left), \u20183\u2019 for MX1, and \u2018positive\u2019 for claudin-3. b The cohort was split into groups with high or low expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts (left) or MX1 in tumour cells (right) using ROC analyses. Cumulative disease-free survival in the groups was compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and log rank tests. c The cohort was split into claudin-low or claudin-high groups, based on expression levels of claudin-3 (positive or negative). The claudin-low group (n\u2009=\u200949) were analysed as in b.Next, we determined whether expression of the molecules we have implicated in chemoresistance correlated with survival after chemotherapy in patients. We collected 109 TNBC resection samples, supported by clinicopathological data including length of disease-free survival. We constructed tissue microarrays containing triplicate cores of cancer tissue and assessed expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 as a marker of active IFN signalling in tumour cells using immunohistochemistry. We also determined whether individual cases could be classified as claudin-low, using immunohistochemistry for claudin-3. Representative images are shown in Fig.\u00a05a. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts was weakly, but significantly, positively associated with high MX1 expression in the tumour cells (Spearman\u2019s correlation r\u2009=\u20090.210; p\u2009=\u20090.028), suggesting that signalling between the cell types was active. High expression of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts, and MX1 in tumour cells were each significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival (by means of almost 800 days; p\u2009<\u20090.02 for both; Fig.\u00a05b).The cohort was also divided into claudin-low (claudin-3 negative; n\u2009=\u200949) and claudin-high (claudin-3 positive; n\u2009=\u200960) subgroups. Interestingly, IFN\u03b21 expression was significantly different between these two groups, with claudin-low tumours expressing overall higher levels (mean scores 2.6 [SD 0.59] vs 2.0 [SD 0.52]; Mann\u2013Whitney p\u2009=\u20090.001). The correlation between fibroblast IFN\u03b21 and tumour cell MX1 was strengthened in the claudin-low group (r\u2009=\u20090.375; p\u2009=\u20090.008) while it was lost in the claudin-high cohort (r\u2009=\u20090.113; p\u2009=\u20090.389), mirroring our tissue culture observations that claudin-low cancers are most receptive to CAF-induced IFN signalling. Similarly, correlations between survival and expression of each of IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells were maintained in claudin-low cases (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a05c) but lost in claudin-highs (Fig. S3). We also carried out multivariate analyses to assess whether IFN\u03b21 in fibroblasts and MX1 in tumour cells provided prognostic insights that were independent of the standard prognostic factors, lymph node status and tumour grade. In the whole cohort, lymph node status and fibroblast IFN\u03b2 expression were significant independent predictors of disease-free survival (with hazard ratios of 2.24 [p\u2009=\u20090.007] and 2.99 [p\u2009=\u20090.001], respectively). In the claudin-low subgroup, both these factors remained significant, with increased hazard ratios (3.77 [p\u2009=\u20090.034] and 3.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.015], respectively). In the claudin-high subgroup, none of the factors were significantly associated with outcome, although lymph node status demonstrated borderline significance (hazard ratio 2.52 [p\u2009=\u20090.052]). We concluded that correlations between IFN\u03b21 and MX1 and survival in breast cancer patients exactly reflect relationships identified in vitro, with CAF-induced IFN activity correlating with chemoresistance and consequently poor survival, specifically within claudin-low cancers.IFN-blocking antibodies inhibit CAF-dependent chemoprotection of cancer cellsBlocking antibodies inhibit CAF-induced chemoprotection.a,\nb MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc (left) or MDA-MB-157 (right) cells were cultured alone, or with breast CAFs or CAF-GFP cells, respectively. Cultures were treated with type I (1\u2009\u03bcg/ml) or type II (5\u2009\u03bcg/ml) interferon-signalling blocking antibodies or appropriate isotype controls for 24\u2009h. Cultures were then treated with 10\u2009nM (MDA-MB-231 cells) or 25\u2009nM (MDA-MB-157 cells) epirubicin or vehicle control, and were redosed with antibodies for a further 24\u2009h. Epithelial cells were then collected by FACS. a Clonogenic survival was determined. Data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). b Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was determined. c MDA-MB-231-GFP/luc cells were cultured alone, or with primary breast CAFs and were treated with antibodies and epirubicin/control exactly as above. Clonogenic survival was determined (left): data are presented as colony counts or relative survival after epirubicin (colony counts relative to untreated). Relative expression of the marker of IFN-signalling activity MX1 was also determined (right). a, b,\nc Data represent means (\u00b1SE) of three independent experimental repeats. Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U tests were carried out and selected differences are shown (ns not significant).Having defined molecular mechanisms involved in CAF-dependent chemoprotection, we wished to test whether these mechanisms could be inhibited, thereby potentially allowing chemo-sensitisation. We selected antibodies that have previously been used for blocking either type I or type II IFN receptors. MDA-MB-231 or MDA-MB-157 cells were again cultured with or without CAFs, and cultures were treated with type I or type II blocking antibodies, or appropriate isotype controls. Cells were then treated with epirubicin or vehicle control, and epithelial survival was determined (Fig.\u00a06). MDA-MB-231 cells were significantly protected from epirubicin by CAFs as previously (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and this protection was significantly reduced by either blocking antibody (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06a, left); notably, CAF-dependent protection was completely inhibited with the type I antibody. MDA-MB-157 cells behaved similarly, although only the type I antibody significantly inhibited protection (p\u2009<\u20090.01; Fig.\u00a06a, right). Importantly, we also used qPCR to assess MX1 expression as a marker of IFN-signalling activity (Fig.\u00a06b). We again confirmed CAF-dependent upregulation of MX1 (as previously in Fig.\u00a02), but also established that blocking antibodies successfully inhibited this upregulation in every case in which blocking antibodies also halted CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but not in the one example where blocking antibody was ineffective (type II antibody, MDA-MB-157). We also repeated the experiment using primary breast CAFs, MDA-MB-231 cells and the type I blocking antibody and demonstrated the same significant ability to block CAF-dependent protection (p\u2009<\u20090.05; Fig.\u00a06c). We concluded that CAF-dependent protection of breast cancer lines required induction of IFN signalling, and, excitingly, that this can be inhibited in order to chemo-sensitise cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the data shown represent only one selected dose of epirubicin, and we have not assessed the formal impact of CAFs and IFN-blocking antibodies on a chemotherapy dose-response.DiscussionOutcomes for TNBC remain relatively poor, and much research is aimed towards identifying novel therapeutic targets and agents in this breast cancer subtype. An alternative approach is to use the therapies already available more effectively, a strategy that drives the need to understand mechanisms underpinning chemotherapy resistance better. In this work, we identify a resistance mechanism that acts in a subset of TNBC using in vitro models, and we confirm its relevance using a patient cohort.We show that breast CAFs protect claudin-low TNBCs from chemotherapy through secretion of IFN\u03b21 leading to paracrine activation of IFN signalling in the cancer cells, as denoted by upregulation of MX1. Our data tie together previous reports showing that CAFs are associated with poor outcomes in TNBC patients, that breast CAFs can secrete IFN\u03b2 thereby activating IFN signalling and influencing behaviour of breast cancer cells in vitro, and that expression of MX1 in breast cancer cells is significantly associated with poor outcomes in patients. Critically, we define the functional impact of this signalling on cancer cells in terms of chemotherapy resistance (Figs.\u00a01 and 4), and indeed chemotherapy-treatment itself contributes to induction of full paracrine activity (Figs.\u00a02 and 3;). This is in contrast to much of the literature on CAFs that defines their influence in terms of inducing proliferation, invasion or metastases, and therefore poor outcomes. This distinction is important clinically, since potential inhibition of CAF-induced chemoresistance could be useful therapeutically, whereas potential inhibition of CAF-induced invasion/metastases is more problematic as these processes are thought to occur prior to breast cancer diagnoses. A further previous study also identified chemoresistance-associated crosstalk between fibroblasts and claudin-low breast cancer cells, although there are key mechanistic differences with our work. Boelens et al. demonstrated that immortalised lung fibroblasts protected both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-157 cells from chemotherapy via activation of NOTCH3 and STAT1, a key IFN-signalling intermediate, and this was associated with upregulation of IFN response genes OAS1 and MX1. However, by marked contrast with our work, the authors determined that cellular crosstalk was mediated by RNA transfer via exosomes, independently of IFN or IFN receptors. We demonstrate by use of IFN-blocking antibodies that this action of breast CAFs is entirely dependent on canonical paracrine IFN signalling (Fig.\u00a06), and we conclude that different fibroblasts signal using different mechanisms. We also suggest our use of both primary and immortal breast fibroblasts may be most relevant.A key discussion point is how these insights could be used to improve cancer outcomes. It is conceivable that alternative treatments could be used for patients whose TNBC tumours display the characteristics identified here as associated with potential anthracycline resistance, namely active IFN signalling between CAFs and claudin-low tumour cells (CAF IFN\u03b2 expression/cancer cell MX1 expression; Fig.\u00a05). However, anthracyclines, often combined with taxanes, are the mainstay of TNBC chemotherapy and comprehensive alternatives are not available, although PARP inhibitors and immune check-point inhibitors show potential in some settings. A more practicable option may be to inhibit crosstalk between CAFs and tumour cells in order to sensitise cancer cells to the existing chemotherapy agents; we present proof of this principle in Fig.\u00a06. We have used receptor-blocking antibodies experimentally since these not only inhibit the pathway required but also specifically target the paracrine aspect of the signalling we wished to prove. This approach also has clinical potential, since a humanised type I receptor-blocking antibody, Anifrolumab, is available and has undergone clinical investigation in lupus. In addition, ruxolitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1/2 kinases, which are IFN-signalling intermediates, that has already been trialled at phase 2 in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. We conclude that available agents may present opportunities for assessment of therapeutic chemo-sensitisation in the relatively near-term.The claudin-low breast cancer subtype was identified more than a decade ago; however, claudin expression levels are not assessed in routine breast cancer management since they have not been found to be useful in directing treatment choices to improve outcomes. Robust clinical identification of the claudin-low phenotype would be required for therapeutic interventions targeting the CAF-dependent chemoresistance we describe. It remains unclear why claudin-high tumours fail to be protected from chemotherapy by CAFs. Our data from patient samples suggest that claudin-high tumours have lower CAF IFN\u03b21 levels, therefore, one explanation is less IFN\u03b21 to activate the pathway. However, we also show that the IFN\u03b21 present does not correlate with IFN-target gene expression in claudin-high cancer cells, and that the claudin-high cell line, MDA-MB-468, fails to respond to either CAFs or recombinant IFNs in vitro, pointing to a more profound signalling defect. MDA-MB-468 cells have previously been shown to activate signalling downstream of the Type II ligand IFN\u03b3, although other published data for Type I signalling, as stimulated by IFN\u03b21, are lacking. Therefore, candidate defects include variation in expression/function of the Type I receptor, IFNAR1, which is known to vary in breast cancer and this variation correlates with prognosis, or aberrant expression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which act to modulate the range and extent of IFN-target gene activation, and are also known to be deregulated in breast cancer.Supplementary informationPublisher\u2019s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information is available for this paper at 10.1038/s41416-020-01226-4.Author contributionsR.V.B.\u2014planned project, designed and performed experiments, analysed data.

        "content": "The interaction between cancer and its local microenvironment can determine properties of growth and metastasis. A critical component of the tumor microenvironment in this context is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF), which can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. It has been hypothesized that CAF may be derived from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), derived from local or distant sources. However, the signaling mechanisms by which tumors and MSCs interact to promote CAF-dependent cancer growth are largely unknown. In this study with in vitro and in vivo models using MDA-MB231 human breast cancer cells, we demonstrate that tumor-derived osteopontin (OPN) induces MSC production of CCL5; the mechanism involves OPN binding to integrin cell surface receptors and activator protein-1 c-jun homodimer transactivation. In a murine xenograft model, concomitant inoculation of MSC with MDA-MB231 cells induces: (i) significantly increased growth and metastasis of MB231 cells and (ii) increased MSC migration to metastatic sites in lung and liver; this mechanism is both OPN and CCL5 dependent. MSCs retrieved from sites of metastases exhibit OPN-dependent expression of the CAF markers, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, tenascin-c, CXCL12 (or stromal cell-derived factor 1) and fibroblast-specific protein-1 and the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. Based upon these results, we propose that tumor-derived OPN promotes tumor progression via the transformation of MSC into CAF.",

IntroductionStromal and parenchymal components of a tissue, whether healthy or malignant, coevolve and depend on each other for their survival. One of the stromal components that have a major impact on cancer progression is fibroblasts (FBs). It has been suggested that \u201cthe next 10 years warrants to be an exciting time for unraveling more hidden secrets of FBs\u201d. For example, standard chemotherapies often promote the emergence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Although CAF biomarkers lack standardization, CAFs largely contribute to the pro-tumor microenvironment and multidrug resistance (MDR), which accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related mortality. It is anticipated that the next generation of cancer therapeutics will likely leverage the body\u2019s own intrinsic and natural responses. Hence, we have sought to trigger tumor suppression by restoring the normal epithelia\u2013FB communications. Here, we have extended our previous findings that FBs expressing CD36, a receptor initially discovered through its roles in lipid uptake and adipogenesis, secrete a cocktail of protein ligands that inhibit the growth of certain types of breast cancer. CD36 is expressed in FBs of normal mammary glands, where normal mammary FBs are known to exert anti-tumor functions through paracrine signaling. Downregulation of CD36 in FBs is one of the CAF markers, and in the normal mammary gland, it is often associated with high mammographic density (MD). Conversely, CD36 is often overexpressed in cancer (epithelial) cells and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Such apparently opposing effects of CD36 expression in cancer cells vs. CAFs make it difficult to target CD36 directly for cancer therapy. We then investigated whether factors secreted from CD36+ FBs might exert anti-tumor effects. We showed that coculturing triple-negative or luminal A breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs in 3D ECM effectively inhibited cancer cell growth. Next, we performed comparative proteomic profiling of the secretome of CD36+ vs. CD36\u2212 FBs and identified a number of candidate protein ligands. After the functional screening, we narrowed down active ligands to SLIT3, PENK, and FBLN-1, and determined their minimum effective concentrations. In the present study, we show that each of the three ligands could also reprogram CAFs and induce their transdifferentiation by overexpressing CD36 and FABP4 while strongly suppressing the growth of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that these ligands could be utilized to develop a new type of breast tumor therapy that simultaneously targets both tumor cells and tumor stroma.2. Results2.1. CD36+ Conditioned Medium Has Minimal Effect on Colony Formation of Non-Transformed MCF10A Cell LineEarlier, we showed that the coculture of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 or Luminal A MCF7 with CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) induced growth suppression in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and reversion of basal and lateral polarity in the Luminal A MCF7. Subsequently, we also showed that the conditioned medium (CM) of the CD36+ fibroblasts (FBs) also induces growth suppression in MDA-MB-231. Because the CM can be concentrated and used as a positive control for future comparative studies, it is important to examine the impact of its concentration on colony formation for a non-transformed cell line such as MCF10A, which is a mammary epithelial cell line. This result is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which indicates a reduction of approximately 30% in colony formation with the highest concentration of CD36+ CM, where the ratio of MCF10A to FB is 1:10. However, the reduction in colony formation is largely due to the culture condition. The fibroblast medium (DMEM) differs from the MCF10A medium (DMEM/F12 + supplements), and adding the CD36+ CM decreased the concentration of necessary supplements for MCF10A growth. Hence, as an extra control, the equivalent amount of DMEM (not conditioned by FBs) is added to the MCF10A culture to clarify the effect of the vehicle and is represented by Control+DMEM.2.2. Recombinant Protein Ligands Induce Growth Suppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell LinesTo start, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at concentrations of 1\u00b5g/mL were added to the MDA-MB-231 growth medium with and without the CM of the CD36+ FBs. Each neutralizing antibody is added one at a time and then three at a time, with the results shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The results indicated that the growth suppression was reverted by the addition of each of the neutralizing antibodies and reverted more by the mixture of the three neutralizing antibodies. Although growth suppression by other factors in the CM of CD36+ FBs cannot be ruled out, it is evident that a significant factor of growth suppression is associated with SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK protein ligands.Next, growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937 was quantified for each of the recombinant proteins (RPs) or their cocktail (represented as SPF), with the results shown in Figure 1. MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and BT549 are classified as Basal B and form a stellate phenotype in 3D culture. HCC1937 has BRCA1 mutation and forms round colonies in 3D, with an example shown in Supplementary Figure S3. Regardless, the sensitivity of these cell lines to RPs did not appear to be cell-line specific, and in all cases, the cocktail of ligands showed higher growth suppression, which suggests that these recombinant proteins have an additive growth suppression effect. The control for this experiment was non-malignant MCF10A which showed an approximately 20% reduction in the rate of colony formation as per our previous manuscript (Supplementary Results).2.3. Recombinant SLIT3 Elevates the Expression of Its Receptor, ROBO2, Suggesting a Positive Feedback Loop for Tumor Suppression in TNBC LinesThe SLIT3 protein consists of regions that include an N-terminal signaling peptide, four leucine-rich repeat domains, six EGF domains, and a laminin G domain followed by a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. All SLIT3 proteins can be cleaved between the fifth and sixth EGF-like domains into the N-terminal (140 kDa) and shorter C-terminal (50\u201360 kDa) segments. ROBO is a transmembrane (TM) protein with five immunoglobulin folds, three fibronectin type III repeats, a TM domain, and four conserved cytoplasmic motifs in its intracellular domain. SLIT3 is commercially available with N-terminus and C-terminus fragments. The N-terminus, from Novus Biological, is produced in HEK293 cells, whereas the C-terminus from Abbexa (Cambridge, UK) is produced from E. coli. Both recombinant fragments were acquired to investigate growth suppression; however, the C-terminus fragment did not indicate any growth suppression. This result is consistent with earlier literature that the C-terminus fragment cannot bind to the ROBO receptor. The N-terminus SLIT3 not only induced growth suppression in four TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, BT549, and HCC1937, but also increased ROBO2 expression, as shown in Figure 2. The ROBO2 receptor is downregulated in cancer cell lines compared to the non-malignant MCF10A, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Downregulation of ROBO2 in cancer cell lines is probably due to their survival mechanism. However, overexpression of ROBO2, as a result of incubation with SLIT3, suggests a positive feedback loop. A plausible mechanism, from neurobiology, could be that endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex (a) enables the recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and (b) induces positive activation of ROBO signaling; hence, a positive feedback loop. Another plausible mechanism is from Slit2-mediated anti-tumoral function in colorectal cancer cells, where both SLIT2 and ROBO are downregulated. In these cancer cells, (a) the Slit2 gene promoter is hypermethylated to suppress its expression, and (b) ROBO expression is downregulated through increased ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, when the recombinant Slit2 protein is added to cancer cells, Slit2 activates the expression of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which prevents ROBO from degradation and stabilizes the protein.2.4. CD36 Expression in Primary CAF Is Reversible and Concomitant with the Elevation of Adipogenic MarkersWe have shown that CD36 is downregulated in primary FBs when cocultured with tumor epithelial cells or incubated with the recombinant protein activin A in a dose-dependent manner (2.25 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) with the proper controls (e.g., activin A neutralizing antibody). We also showed that (a) CD36\u2212 FBs secrete more activin A, creating a positive feedback loop for tumor progression, and (b) CD36 expression in FBs is reversible once activin A is removed (Supplementary Results). However, within the tumor microenvironment, it is also important to show whether these three recombinant proteins, secreted from CD36+ FBs, can also revert CD36 in CAFs. We acquired CAFs (Cell Biologics: HC-6071 (Chicago, IL, USA)), which require the same culture medium as the primary FBs from Cell Biologics. To our knowledge, HC-6071 is the only commercially available mammary CAF. We incubated the CAFs with the same concentration of the RPs or their cocktail. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate that CD36 expression is upregulated in CAFs as a result of exposure to each RP, but their cocktail (SPF) made no additional difference. Furthermore, CD36 is involved in fatty-acid transport and energy dissipation and is a marker for adipose tissue-derived stem cells; hence, we hypothesized that one of the mechanisms of upregulation of CD36 in CAF, by RPs, should also be due to higher adipogenic markers, which is quantified by the overexpression of FABP4, per Figure 3. In adipocytes, FABP4, also known as aP2, is a carrier protein for fatty acids that is highly expressed in adipocytes and macrophages. The controls were MCF10A and three TNBC breast cancer cell lines, including differentiated adipocytes that overexpress CD36 and FABP4, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5. The FABP4 is also expressed in MCF10A but not in TNBC cell lines, and the incubation of these lines with a cocktail of the three RPs did not alter the FABP4 expression. Hence, RPs only reverse FABP4 expression in the CAFs.2.5. The Agonist Antibody for PENK Induces Growth Suppression in Four TNBC LinesEach of the three active ligands has at least one and up to five known receptors, and we opted to investigate [Met5] Enkephalin acetate salt hydrate, which is an agonist antibody for the OGFr, a receptor for PENK. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr, regulate proliferation in normal and cancer cells, and their expression has been shown to be downregulated in ovarian cancer and to restrict proliferation in pancreatic cancer. OGF is chemically termed [Met(5)]-enkephalin, which is an endogenous opioid peptide that interfaces with OGFr and delays the cell cycle. The OGF-OGFr axis is also shown to induce growth suppression in both human breast and pancreatic cells. Figure 4 indicates that [Met(5)]-enkephalin induces growth suppression in three TNBC lines of MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hs578t in a dose-dependent manner in 3D cultures. The control included colony formation in MCF10A, which indicated no loss of colony formation at the highest concentration of Met5, as shown in Supplementary Figures S6 and S7.3. DiscussionIn this manuscript, we reported an extended study on the growth suppression of multiple cancer cell lines with ligands derived from CD36+ fibroblasts or an agonist for one of the ligands, PENK. More importantly, we demonstrated that after treatment with these ligands, adipogenic makers in CAFs were elevated. Below, we discuss potential mechanistic insights for the tumor suppressive roles of these ligand/receptor pathways.The SLIT/ROBO signaling has been extensively reviewed as a tumor suppressive pathway, where their expression is downmodulated in most cancer types, probably due to their survival mechanism. Nevertheless, their roles in cancer cell motility remain controversial. One study reports that this pathway inhibits cell migration and invasion by regulating E-cadherin-dependent adhesion and, consequently, \u03b2-catenin, while another study reports the opposite. Such a contradiction is likely due to the complexities of multiple isoforms of SLIT (i.e., SLIT1-3) and ROBO (i.e., ROBO1-4) that might play different roles. Here, we have shown the N-terminal SLIT3 protein induces growth suppression of four triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. We have shown that ectopic SLIT3 treatment of cancer cells elevates the expression of the receptor ROBO2, suggesting a positive feedback loop. Plausible mechanisms include endocytosis of this ligand-receptor complex that enables the recycling of the complex to the cell surface to amplify ROBO signaling.The roles of the glycoprotein FBLN-1 in tumors have not been extensively explored, and the results are somehow controversial. One study shows that overexpression of FBLN-1 in breast cancer cell lines promotes resistance to doxorubicin, whereas another study reports that inhibition of FBLN-1 in cancer cell lines increases the sensitivity to the same drug. It is also reported that FBLN-1 interacts with the protumor ADAMTS-1 to block the activity of the latter in promoting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Because of the scarcity of literature on the role of the ectopic FBLN-1 protein in the growth suppression of breast cancer cells, this subject matter may open up a new direction for cancer research.PENK is proposed as a tumor suppressor in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. PENK expression negatively correlates with the tumor grade, and its high expression is linked to a favorable clinical outcome. In another study, PENK is found to be downregulated in osteosarcoma (OS). Overexpression of PENK inhibits migration of OS cells, possibly through downregulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Here, we also have shown that the ectopic PENK protein or its agonist antibody also induces growth suppression of multiple triple-negative cell lines.One of the major concerns in administering recombinant proteins or their agonist antibodies is their interactions with the immune system. A recent study indicates that CD36 expression positively correlates with the immune and stromal scores of different types of cancer. Among factors secreted from the CD36+ FBs, (a) SLIT3 has been shown to increase the directional migration of monocytes and recruitment of myeloid cells in vivo. (b) FBLN-1 is also found to be a pro-immunogenic glycoprotein involved in interactions between dendritic cells and cytotoxic T cells, and the high expression is linked to better lymphoid infiltration of breast tumors. (c) PENK is involved in the activation of opioid receptors, which are highly expressed in the nervous system as well as immune cells. The expression levels of PENK are also similar between the nervous and lymphoid systems, suggesting that this signaling pathway plays essential roles in both nervous and lymphoid systems. In fact, it has been suggested that there is a reciprocal interaction between the immune system and opioids. Collectively, there is clear evidence that these three ligands interact with the immune system, and their therapeutic use may potentially complement immunotherapy.Our future efforts will focus on ex vivo tumor samples, where they will be incubated with the three recombinant proteins, sectioned, and stained for different cell types and quantifying their expression, e.g., vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, CD8, CD14. Next, the efficacy of the recombinant proteins will be determined in plasma, followed by in vivo experiments to assess tumor response in the mouse fat pad.In conclusion, our current results strongly suggest that the proposed three ligands can induce growth suppression in breast cancer cells with minimal effect on healthy cells while reprogramming the tumor stroma. Moreover, these three ligands have the potential to interact with the immune system and complement immunotherapy.4. Materials and Methods4.1. Cell CultureEpithelial cells (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, Hs578T, and HCC1937) were cultured in 96-well plates (3\u20136 repeats) using the 3D on-top method with respective growth media. Briefly, a thin layer of Matrigel (17\u201320 \u00b5L/cm2, Corning 356243 (Corning, NY, USA)) was spread evenly on the surface of each well of a pre-chilled plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min to gel. Cells were suspended in the culture medium containing 5% Matrigel at a seeding density of 10,000 cells/cm2 for TNBC lines and 20,000 cells/cm2 for the non-malignant cell line unless otherwise specified. Cell suspensions were added to each well on the base Matrigel layer and incubated in a 37 \u00b0C humidified chamber for 24 h. The next day (considered as day 0), the culture medium was replaced by the treatment medium (described later in detail for each experiment) and thenceforth replenished with a fresh treatment medium after 48 h. On day 4 of the experiments, unless otherwise specified, the plates were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% fresh PFA, followed by DAPI staining and quantitative analysis.Pre-adipocytes (ATCC PCS-210-010 (Manassas, VA, USA)) were cultured in fibroblast basal medium (ATCC PCS-201-030) supplemented with a low-serum fibroblast growth kit (PCS-201-041) as per ATCC\u2019s handling information. The pre-adipocytes were cultured in adipogenic base media (R&D systems CCM007 (Minneapolis, MN, USA)) supplemented with adipogenic supplement (R&D system CCM011) and 10% FBS (ATCC 30-2020) for adipogenic differentiation.Primary fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (Cell Biologics H-6071 and HC-6071) were cultured in a complete fibroblast medium (Cell Biologics M2267) as per the company\u2019s protocol.4.2. Cell Culture TreatmentHuman recombinant proteins, SLIT3 (Novus Biological 9255-SL-050 (Littleton, CO, USA)), FBLN1 (Abbexa abx066632), and PENK (Abbexa abx650333), were commercially acquired. (MET5) Enkephalin (Sigma M6638 ((St. Louis, MI, USA))) was also purchased commercially. For drug treatment on cells, each protein was used individually or combined (SPF). On day 0, the final concentrations of SLIT3, FBLN1, and PENK at 74 nM, 140 nM, and 33 nM, respectively, were added to the culture. MET5 was added at final concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 \u00b5M. Normal growth media were used as a control. All drugs and media were replaced every two days. The samples were fixed after four days of drug exposure.To validate the growth inhibitory effect of protein ligands, neutralizing antibodies for SLIT3 (Novus Biological AF3629-SP), FBLN1 (Novus Biological NBP1-84725-25ul), and PENK (Novus Biological NBP1-90944-25ul), at a concentration of 1 \u00b5g/mL, were added to the CD36+ CM and applied to 3D-cultured cell lines.4.3. Immunofluorescence StainingFor CD36 and FABP4 staining on fibroblasts, cell cultures were washed three times with DPBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 14040-133 (Waltham, MA, USA)) and fixed at room temperature in 4% PFA (Thermo Scientific 28908) for 15 min. After three PBS washes, cells were permeabilized using a Triton X-100 solution (0.5%, Sigma T8787) for 10 min and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma A7638) in DPBS on a shaker at RT. The primary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to cells overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The following day, samples were washed three times in DPBS (15 min per wash). Each secondary antibody, listed in Table 1, was diluted in the blocking solution and applied to samples for 1 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (15 min per wash). Finally, the nuclei were counterstained with 100 ng/mL 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Life Science Technology D1306 (Seoul, Korea)).For ROBO2 and FABP4 (Table 1) staining on epithelial cells, the same procedure was followed, except for replacing DPBS with PBS (without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Thermo Scientific 10010023).4.4. Fluorescence Microscopy and Quantitative AnalysisThe readout for each molecular endpoint is based on fluorescence microscopy, where our lab has excelled in the development of quantitative assays. Typically, 60 to 300 cells are present per field of view with a 10\u00d7 objective, which provides significant power for data analysis. On average, two to five fields of view are imaged per well, and there are three to six wells sampled per condition. Samples were imaged with an EVOS FL Auto Imaging System equipped with an AMEP 4633 10\u00d7 phase objective (0.25 of NA and 6.9 mm of WD) and a 40\u00d7 objective (0.8 ND and 3.3mm working distance). The excitation lasers were set at 385, 488, and 568 nm for DAPI, Alexa 488, and 568 fluorophores, respectively. All other imaging parameters were kept constant for all specimens.4.5. Statistical AnalysisMost of the experiments were performed with six biological replicates, i.e., six wells per condition, where each well is imaged with a 10\u00d7 objective and fluorescent microscopy. From each well, at least two fields of view are captured, cells are segmented using the DAPI stain and are counted, and relevant protein contents are computed on a cell-by-cell basis. This information is then averaged over each field of view. The averaged results per field of view are then shown in the scatter bar chart, where each point in a bar chart represents either the total number of cells per field of view or the average fluorescent per cell per field of view.

        "content": "To explore the effects of breast cancer (BC)-derived exosomes on invasion and migration of BC cells. Exosomes (Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1) were extracted from normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), BC cells (MCF-7/MDA-MB-231) and BC cells with miR-146a overexpression or knockdown using multi-step differential centrifugation. Morphologies and sizes of exosomes were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and particle size analysis respectively. BC mouse models were injected with DIR labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 or Exo-M1. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BC cells was determined by PCR and Western blot. PKH67 labeled Exo-MA, Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 were incubated with NFs or MCF-7 to measure the activation of CAFs. Cell invasion and migration abilities were determined by scratch test and Transwell assay. Exo-MA, Exo-M7, Exo-M1 were successfully extracted with positive expressions of Alix, CD63 and TSG101. Contents of Ki67, N-cadherin, Vimentin and Snail-1 were increased but E-cadherin was decreased, compared to Exo-MA group. Exo-M7 or Exo-M1 could increase BC cell proliferation and enhance EMT in nude mouse. Exo-M7 and Exo-M1 could accelerate the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote the recruitment of CAFs in MCF-7. Transfection of miR-146a could promote the transformation of NFs into CAFs and promote cell invasion and migration of MCF-7\u00a0cells. As a target gene of miR-146a, TXNIP could inhibit the activation of CAFs. miR-146a overexpression or TXNIP silence enhance the activation of Wnt signal pathway. BC-derived exosomes promote the activation of CAFs through miR-146a/TXNIP axis to activate Wnt pathway, which in turn enhances invasion and metastasis of BC cells.",

Therefore, this study lays a road map to exploit the TME for the advancement of \u201csmart\u201d nanomedicines that would constitute the next generation of cancer therapeutics.BackgroundNanoparticles are being widely explored in radiotherapy and chemotherapy (left most). The proper understanding of the interface between nanotechnology and tumor microenvironment (TME) involves elucidating the behavior of nanoparticles not only in cancer cells but also in other key components of TME, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and normal fibroblasts (FBs) (middle). The information gathered from this study will play a significant role in advancing \u201csmart\u201d nano-based medicines into future clinical trials after testing them successfully in vivo (right most)According to the global cancer observatory (GLOBOCAN), in 2018, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide, and 9.9 million cancer deaths (Bray et al.). Most cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiotherapy (RT), and chemotherapy (CT). In RT and CT, the maximum tolerated dose is being utilized to treat patients. Innovative approaches are essential to address one of the main issues in both RT and CT: normal tissue toxicity. Nanoparticle (NP)-based packages provide a platform to deliver targeted therapeutics, offering the means to further improve CT through controlled delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells while local RT dose can be enhanced by targeting NP-based radiosensitizers to tumors. Most nanotechnology-based research has so far mainly focused on cancer cells, and not on other key cellular components within the tumor microenvironment (TME) (Miao and Huang). As illustrated in thematic Fig.\u00a01, the goal of this study is to elucidate the fate of NPs within key interrelated cellular components of the TME, which includes cancer cells, fibroblasts (FBs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), in order to fully exploit the promise of cancer nanomedicine.The progression of a tumor depends on the dynamic interactions between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma within the TME (Alkasalias et al.). The stroma includes the extra cellular matrix (ECM), the basement membrane, local immune cells, vasculature, and normal FBs. FBs, as the building blocks of connective tissues, are key components of the TME. Interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding FBs serve an important role in cancer proliferation. It has been suggested that FBs inhibit cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Alkasalias et al.). However, FBs present within a TME can be recruited by the cancer, turning them into CAFs to promote the tumor growth. CAFs are the most abundant cell type in the tumor stroma and are actively involved in tumor progression and invasion (Wang et al.). Hence, in addition to tumor cells, CAFs and FBs are the most prominent cell types in the tumor stroma that\u00a0require attention, in order to build successful NP-based therapeutic strategies to eradicate cancer (Anderberg and Pietras). The potential of NP-based platforms in both RT and CT has been focused mainly on cancer cells; however, it is not yet known how NPs interact with other key components of TME such as FBs and CAFs. We used two tumor cell models for this study: HeLa, a cervical cancer cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. In order to study the fate of NPs across these stromal cells, we chose GNPs as our model NP system.Among other NP systems, we used GNPs as a model NP system for this study due to their promising results in several practiced clinical applications including RT and CT as described in Fig.\u00a01 (left most) (Chithrani et al.; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez et al.; Khoo et al.; Paciotti et al.). Biocompatibility of GNPs and their ability to act as a vector for targeted drug delivery to the tumor were demonstrated successfully in a phase I clinical trial (Libutti et al.). A systemic administration of the GNP\u2013drug complex resulted in a delivery of drug doses that were previously shown to be toxic (Libutti et al.). In RT, GNPs have been successfully tested as a promising radiosensitizer (Antosh et al.; Bromma et al.; Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). The presence of GNPs during RT results in a higher cross section to low-energy photons, producing low-energy electrons and free radicals that could damage tumor cells (Carter et al.; McMahon et al.; Zheng and Sanche). Using clinically relevant higher energy (mega electron volt) photon beams, many research groups have demonstrated the GNP-mediated dose enhancement at clinically feasible NP concentrations (Chithrani et al.; Wolfe et al.). In addition, gold-based NPs are also being explored in imaging, photothermal therapy, and as well as a tool for releasing drugs remotely (Ali et al.; Chanda et al.; Goodman et al.). Therefore, the potential of GNPs in many cancer nanotechnology-based applications prompted its use as our model NP system in this study. The next important step was to decide on the size and surface properties of GNPs.The size and surface properties of the NPs could influence their interaction at the\u00a0individual cell level as well as within the TME. In monolayer cell cultures, the absence of the ECM does not affect transport of NPs compared to tissue-like structures where the ECM can act as a NP transport barrier. Among the size range of 10\u2013100\u00a0nm, NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm have shown the highest uptake in monolayer cell cultures (Chithrani et al.; Gao et al.). However, both the size of NPs and the presence of ECM are expected to play a significant role in their penetration and uptake in tissue-like (three dimensional in vitro) models. As expected, studies have shown that smaller NPs penetrate better through tissue compared to NPs of diameter 50\u00a0nm which was the optimum size in monolayer cell cultures (Yohan et al.). Since smaller NPs have a higher probability of penetrating through the ECM once they leave the leaky vasculature present in tumors, increasing the uptake of those smaller NPs to be similar to that of 50-nm diameter ones is essential (Yang et al.). It has been shown that adding a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD, could significantly improve the uptake of smaller NPs (Cruje; Kim et al.; Yang et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). However, addition of RGD peptide requires stabilization of NPs to avoid aggregation. While the most used stabilization agent is pentapeptide, we used polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules instead since an RGD/PEG combination would start bridging the gap between in vitro and in vivo, where stability and improved uptake is crucial. This will allow for translation of this work to future in vivo studies followed by clinical trials.Our study aims at understanding of the differential uptake, distribution, retention, and toxicity of GNPs not only in cancer cells, but also in other two interrelated key cell types, FBs and CAFs in TME (Fig.\u00a01; middle). The outcome of this study will promote designing of smart nanomaterials to yield optimum results in a real TME which would accelerate nano-based therapeutics in animal models followed by clinical translation as laid out in schematic Fig.\u00a01 (right most). An ideal NP-based platform would eradicate tumor cells, protect FBs, and deactivate CAFs.Results and discussionCharacterization of GNP complexes and determining their cellular uptake across key cellular components of the tumor microenvironmentCharacterization of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) that were used as the model NP system for this study. a Schematic diagram of a GNP functionalized with a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (referred to as RGD peptide) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). This GNP complex is referred to as GNPPEG-RGD. b Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of GNPs with measured core diameter of\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm. c, d Darkfield image and spectral profile of GNPs, respectively. e, f UV\u2013visible absorption spectra and -potential measurements of as-made GNPs and GNPPEG\u2013RGD. (g) Summary of characterization data for as-made GNPs, GNPPEG, and GNPPEG-RGD. The measurements were done using three different samples (n\u2009=\u20093) and error represents standard deviationTo study the uptake cross-section among key cellular components within the TME, we used smaller sized GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm functionalized with both PEG and RGD peptide (Fig.\u00a02a). The rationale behind choosing this particular size and functional molecules was given in the introduction section. Based on our transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, the average core diameter of synthesized GNPs was 16.5 \u00b1\u2009 3.6\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a02b). In addition, both dark-field and hyperspectral imaging technology were employed to visualize GNPs. The dark-field image of GNPs used for the study and their corresponding reflectance spectra are given in Fig.\u00a02c, d, respectively. The spectra with higher intensity represent data collected from GNPs while the flat spectra represent the signal from the background areas where there were no GNPs. The peak wavelength of UV\u2013visible absorption spectrum of bare GNPs was 518\u00a0nm and it is aligned with the peak wavelength for 15\u201317\u00a0nm GNPs (Fig.\u00a02e) (Haiss et al.). There was only a slight red shift of the surface plasmon absorption peak wavelength for RGD/PEG modified GNPs (GNPPEG-RGD) since both RGD-peptide and PEG molecules were considerably smaller. For example, the molecular weight of RGD-peptide and PEG were 1760 and 2000\u00a0Da, respectively. However, the addition of PEG and RGD peptide resulted in a replacement of negatively charged citrate molecules which led to a significant change in the surface charge (Fig.\u00a02f). The change in the hydrodynamic diameter was also measured and the results are listed in Fig.\u00a02g. GNPPEG\u2013RGD complex was used for this study to determine the differential uptake of GNPs among HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (cancer cell lines), FBs (normal cell line), and CAFs as discussed in the next section.Quantitative and qualitative analysis of cellular uptake of GNPPEG-RGD. a, b Quantification of NP uptake per cell and per unit volume of the cell. c\u2013e Darkfield images of HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. f\u2013h Spectra collected from GNP clusters localized within the cells and from background in HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times (n\u2009=\u20093) and the data presented is the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe majority of NPs are taken up by cells through a receptor mediated endocytosis (RME) process (Chithrani et al.; Zhang et al.). Once internalized, NPs get trapped in endosomes followed by fusion with lysosomes for further processing around the perinuclear region. Most of the receptors are recycled back to the cellular membrane while vesicles containing processed NPs head towards cell periphery for excretion (Chithrani and Chan; Chithrani). The process of cellular uptake of GNPs is dynamic and the number of GNPs present per cell for HeLa, MDA-MB-231, FBs, and CAFs within a 24\u00a0h incubation time period is plotted in Fig.\u00a03a. Our GNP uptake experiments were carried out at 0.2\u00a0nM, since such concentrations are more relevant in vivo and the outcome of this study could be a useful resource to extrapolate meaningful conclusions for future clinical applications (Wolfe et al.; Yang et al.). After an incubation time period of 24\u00a0h, CAFs and cancer cells (both HeLa and MDA-MB-231) had a much higher NP uptake both per cell and per unit volume in comparison to FBs (Fig.\u00a03a, b). According to Fig.\u00a03a, GNP uptake per cell in cancer cells and CAFs was\u2009~\u20096- and\u2009~\u200912-fold higher compared to FBs, respectively (Fig.\u00a03a). We also looked at the presence of NPs per unit volume due to the significant differences in size and morphology among these cells as seen in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e. According to Fig.\u00a03b, cancer cells and CAFs had a\u2009~\u200925- and\u2009~\u200910-fold higher uptake per unit cell volume compared to FBs, respectively. This result is very promising considering one of the major concerns in NP-based therapeutics is the normal tissue toxicity. The FBs are also present within the TME where they can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiation and metastatic behavior (Alkasalias et al.). Having a significantly lower number of NPs in normal FBs would produce less damage and is very encouraging. The presence of significantly higher number of GNPs in cancer-associated cells such as HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and CAFs is also very promising in both RT and CT applications, since it would result in a higher RT dose and a more optimum delivery of drugs, causing the necessary damage to eradicate the tumor.The intracellular distribution of GNP complex (GNPPEG-RGD) within HeLa, FBs, and CAFs was captured using dark field microscopy as shown in Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e, respectively. The imaging data corresponding to MDA-MB-231 cell line are given in the Additional file 1: Section S1. In this study, we first synthesized GNPs (as-made GNPs), secondly added PEG onto to as-made GNPs (GNPPEG), and finally added RGD peptide onto GNPPEG complex (GNPPEG-RGD). We also followed the differences in intracellular distribution corresponding to two intermediate NP complexes, such as as-made GNPs and GNPPEG using darkfield imaging (see the Additional file 1: Section S2). The results are consistent with previously published work for MDA-MB-231 cell line (Cruje et al.). For example, the addition of PEG onto as-made GNPs resulted in a significant decrease in NP uptake. However, the addition of RGD peptides onto the GNPPEG complex resulted in a significant increase in NP uptake.The presence of higher number of GNPs in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs was apparent from these images (Fig.\u00a03c\u2013e). The reflectance spectra collected from NP clusters and background are displayed in Fig.\u00a03f\u2013h. Based on both quantitative and qualitative data, it is evident that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231; see Additional file 1 for MDA-MB-231) and CAFs can be populated with significantly larger densities of GNP compared to normal FBs. As described previously, CAFs are the most abundant cells of the tumor stroma, where they substantially influence tumor growth through control of the surrounding TME (Mardhian et al.; Mertens et al.). As a result of the larger uptake of the GNPs in CAFs, researchers have the opportunity to build nano-strategies to eradicate not just the cancer cells, but also the supporting cells, to fully eliminate the tumor (Truffi et al.).Intracellular distribution of NPsMicrotubule (MT) network and distribution of NPs within the cell. a Schematic diagram of a cell illustrating the transport of vesicles along the MTs within the cell. b Schematic explaining the directional transport of vesicles containing GNPs along the MTs. c MT network (1) of a HeLa cell and the merged image (2) of the MT network and distribution of vesicles containing GNPs. MTs and vesicles containing GNPs are labeled in green and red, respectively. d, e MT network and GNP distribution in FBs and CAFs, respectivelyThe microtubules (MTs) in the cytoskeleton of cells play an important role in transporting these NP complexes within cells as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04 (Gradishar; Granger et al.; Paoletti et al.). These MTs are arranged radially, nucleating from a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) near the nucleus and extending towards the cell membrane (Fig.\u00a04a). Motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin play a significant role in trafficking organelles and vesicles containing NP clusters within the cell (Kuli\u0107 et al.). For example, kinesin\u00a0and\u00a0dynein\u00a0move vesicles containing cargo such as NPs in opposite directions along\u00a0microtubules as shown in Fig.\u00a04b. A confocal image slice across the nucleus of a HeLa cell is presented in Fig.\u00a04c-1 where the MTOC and MT network (labeled in green) are clearly seen. An image taken at the depth of the nucleus ensures that the imaged GNPs, as well as other properties, are contained within the cell and not adhered to the surface. The merged image of vesicles containing GNPs (marked in red) and MT network is displayed in Fig.\u00a04c-2. The images in Fig.\u00a04d\u2013f show the MT network and vesicles containing NPs within MDA-MB-231 Cells, FBs and CAFs, respectively. It is evident from these images that cancer cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231) and CAFs had a significantly higher presence of GNPs as compared to normal cells, i.e., FBs, consistent with our quantitative and qualitative data in Fig.\u00a03. It is also clear that NPs were localized only within the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus, as expected. Figure\u00a03 has images of individual cells and Additional file 1: S3\u2013S6 were added to include additional images for further illustrations. A recent study has demonstrated how this MT network can be manipulated using a taxane-based anticancer drug, docetaxel, to redistribute GNPs closer to the nucleus for optimum outcome in RT (Bannister et al.). The use of docetaxel as a novel strategy in the future could significantly improve RT and CT, since both cancer cells and CAFs take up a significantly higher number of GNPs compared to normal FBs, in accordance with our results.Processing and retention of NPsEndolysosomal distribution in a control cells and in b cells treated with GNPs.

Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average. The error bars represent standard error. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u03bcmThe processing of internalized GNPs involves many steps (Huotari and Helenius). For example, NPs first encounter membrane-bound intracellular vesicles called early endosomes once they are internalized by the cells through the endocytosis process. These endosomal vesicles are categorized into three types: early endosomes, late endosomes and recycling endosomes. Early endosomes ferry the cargo to the desired cellular destination. Part of the cargo such as cell surface receptors is recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes. Early endosomes then transform into late endosomes followed by integration with lysosomes to form endolysosomal vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes contained within these vesicles degrade the trapped NPs. We looked at the distribution of NPs in endolysosomal vesicles within the MT network of the cell. According to Fig.\u00a05, there were fewer lysosomes in control cells compared to cells treated with GNPs. This increase in\u00a0the number of endolysosomal vesicles in cells treated with NPs could be due to the additional processing necessary. After an incubation period of 24\u00a0h, most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles; however, there were some NPs still in endosomal vesicles. This is due to the fact that NPs are constantly taken up, processed, and removed by cells, resulting in this distribution. Our results are consistent with previous studies where most of the NPs were in endolysosomal vesicles after 24\u00a0h of incubation (Chithrani et al.; Foroozandeh and Aziz). According to Fig.\u00a05b, there was a significant increase in number of endolysosomal vesicles in tumor cells and CAFs compared to FBs. This could be due to increase in NP uptake (see Fig.\u00a03) in cancer cells and CAFs compared to FBs. Considering the fact that FBs turned into CAFs to support tumor growth, we also looked at whether there is a change in the number of mitochondria present in FBs vs CAFs (Additional file 1: S7). Based on the imaging data, there was no significant difference in the presence of mitochondria in FBs vs CAFs. The ability of cells to retain NPs can play a significant role in nanotechnology-based applications in cancer therapy (Srinivasan et al.). We looked at the potential of retaining GNPs within these three cell types once the media containing GNPs was replaced with fresh media for a duration of 24\u00a0h. Our quantification results in Fig.\u00a06a demonstrate that the proportion of GNPs retained in HeLa and CAFs was higher compared to FBs. The observed drop in GNP content could be due to exocytosis or redistribution of NPs via division (Chithrani and Chan; Kim et al.). For example, redistribution of GNPs in a parent cell between two daughter cells is given in Fig.\u00a06b.This would result in lower number of GNPs in each daughter cell compared to the original parent cell. Both cancer cells and CAFs were able to retain over 60% of internalized NPs even after 24\u00a0h. In the case of FBs, the retention of NPs was approximately 40%, which is much lower compared to both CAFs and cancer cells. Qualitative data presented in Fig.\u00a06c support the quantification data given in Fig.\u00a06a. A significant number of NPs are still present in cancer cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs (see Additional file 1: S8\u2013S11 for data corresponding to additional data all 4 cell lines studied). Thus, according to our uptake and retention studies, cancer cells and CAFs have both a significantly higher uptake and longer retention compared to FBs. This could be ideal for the translation of GNPs as drug carriers and radiation sensitizers into current cancer therapy, since the observed behavior of the cancer-associated cells compared to the normal FBs is conducive to reducing normal tissue toxicity.Cell proliferation and DNA damage in the presence of NPsEvaluation of toxicity introduced by GNPs via probing of proliferation and DNA damage. a\u2013c Cell proliferation as a function of time for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. d Cell survival fraction measured using a clonogenic assay for HeLa and MDA-MB-231. e Comparison of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) between control cells and ones treated with GNPs as measured using 53BP1 foci. f\u2013h Projected confocal images of HeLa (first column), FBs (second column), and CAFs (third column), respectively. Nuclei and 53BP1 foci are marked in blue and green, respectively. Experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are the average of at least 50 nuclei. The error bars represent standard deviation. Scale bar\u2009=\u200920 \u00b5mThe ultimate goal of using NP as a drug delivery system or radiosensitizer is to increase the therapeutic ratio, or the margin between the dose needed for clinical efficacy and the dose inducing adverse side effects such as toxicity (De Jong and Borm). To yield this full potential of NPs in cancer therapy, it is necessary to evaluate the damage introduced to normal cells vs cancer cells. We assessed the\u00a0toxicity introduced by NPs through monitoring cell proliferation and assessing DNA damage. It is important to mention again that the GNP complex used for the study is fully compatible for future in vivo studies followed by clinical studies, and the concentration utilized is also clinically feasible (Schuemann et al.; Yang et al.; Zhang et al.). Hence, our results provide meaningful data for designing future experiments. Proliferation of cells was monitored to measure any effect GNPs would have on the growth pattern and the results are given in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs, respectively. It was important to notice that there was no significant toxicity induced by the GNPs to FBs or cancer-associated cells (HeLa and CAFs). We also fitted the experimental data shown in Fig.\u00a07a\u2013c to calculate the doubling time () for each cell line (Additional file 1: S12). Based on the fitted curves,  for HeLa, FBs, and CAFs were 19.5, 49.7 and 77\u00a0h, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.009) and the values are in agreement with previous literature (Liberato et al.; Puck et al.; Zhang et al.). According to our fitted data, there was no significant difference in the growth with the addition of GNPs relative to control in all three cell lines. We also looked at long-term effects of NPs on cell growth using a clonogenic assay. There was no introduced toxicity due to GNPs for both HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (Fig.\u00a07d). It was very difficult to carry out clonogenic assay for FBs and CAFs since their  was much longer and they did not form consistent colonies. Furthermore, there was also no significant increase in DNA damage with the addition of GNPs in any cell line (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). We probed the most lethal damage to DNA, which is double stand breaks (DSBs), using an antibody targeted towards one of the repair proteins, 53BP1. The number of 53BP1 foci in cells treated with GNPs was compared to the control (see Fig.\u00a07e, f\u2013h). Thus, it can be concluded the GNP complexes used in this study themselves, i.e., without radiation, do not have a toxic effect on either of the cell lines.ConclusionThis study unveils the differential cross section of NP uptake, processing, retention, and toxicity across key cell components of the TME (tumor cells, FBs, and CAFs) for the first time (see Fig.\u00a01). In this study, we used GNPs of 15\u00a0nm diameter which were functionalized with both PEG molecules and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD. Both CAFs and FBs play a significant role in tumor growth: FBs can exert diverse suppressive functions against cancer initiating and metastatic cells in order to suppress tumor progression while CAFs could promote tumor growth. In order to build an ideal NP-based therapeutic platform to battle cancer, we need to eradicate both cancer cells and CAFs while keeping the damage to a minimum in FBs. Results of our study showed that cellular uptake of GNPs per unit cell volume for HeLa (tumor cells) and CAFs was over 25- and 10-fold higher compared to the FBs. However, the significantly higher presence of\u00a0GNPs within cells did not introduce any additional toxicity, based on our proliferation and DNA damage results. Further, FBs have the least ability to retain the NPs within the cell body as compared to tumor cells and CAFs. The higher NP uptake and retention in tumor cells and CAFs as compared to FBs is very encouraging and significant for their potential use in future clinical trials. A recent study clearly showed the bridge between the MT network and NP transport, using one of the most common anticancer drugs, docetaxel, which was used to manipulate MTs for trapping NPs closer to the nucleus for a longer period of time (Bannister et al.). This resulted in higher radiation dose enhancement during RT and finally producing synergistic therapeutic outcome in GNP-mediated chemoradiation. Due to the higher number of GNPs present in tumor cells and CAFs compared to normal FBs, we propose to exploit the MT network using such chemotherapeutic drugs in designing smart NP-based medicine for optimized outcome in therapeutics. Furthermore, over 20 nanotechnology-based therapeutic products have been approved for clinical use in the past two decades (Miao and Huang). Considering clinical trials that have been concluded successfully using GNPs either as a drug delivery vehicle or as a photothermal agent, GNP-mediated cancer therapeutics with minimum side effects are on the horizon for cancer patients (Libutti et al.; Rastinehad et al.; Schuemann et al.). One of the limitations in this study is the use of one cell line each from normal FB and CAF cell line. Our future studies will extend to many patient-derived FBs and CAFs in order to make predictions in a more diverse and relevant population.Materials and methodsPreparation of GNPsCitrate reduction method was used to prepare GNPs of diameter\u2009~\u200915\u00a0nm (Kimling et al.). In summary, 300 \u00b5L of 1% chloroauric acid () was added to 30 mL of double distilled water followed by heating while stirring. 1 mL of 1% sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate  was added to the mixture once it reached the boiling point and kept stirring until the color of the mixture turned a ruby red. The solution was brought back to room temperature while stirring.Surface functionalization of GNPsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a02, GNPs were surface functionalized with both PEG (2\u00a0kDa PEG-thiol) and a peptide containing integrin-binding domain, RGD (RGD peptide: N -Cys-Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys\u2013Lys-Lys-Gly-Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Met-Phe-Gly-COOH). The GNPs were first surface functionalized with PEG at a ratio of 1 PEG molecule per  of surface area, assuming a perfect sphere (). For optical imaging, was synthesized with a mix of the 2-kDa PEG and a 3.2-kDa PEG-thiol-Cy5 complex in equal proportions. To prepare , RGD peptide was added to mixture containing  at a ratio of 1 peptide molecule per every 2 PEG molecules ().GNP complexes were characterized using via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013Vis) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer  365 Spectrophotometer), dynamic light scattering (DLS; Anton Paar LiteSizer 500), and -potential (Anton Paar LiteSizer 500). We also used darkfield microscopy and hyper spectral imaging (HSI; CytoViva) for characterization of GNPs. For TEM imaging, GNPs were placed on a grid and dried before imaging. We used cuvettes for UV, DLS, and zeta potential measurements of GNP complexes in aqueous medium. GNP complexes were placed on cover slips and dried before mounting them on microscope glass slides for darkfield and HSI imaging.Cellular uptake and retention of gold nanoparticle complexesHeLa, MDA-MB-231, normal fibroblast, and cancer-associated fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC in 2019 and the catalog numbers are CCL-2, HTB-26, CRL-7636, and CRL 7637, respectively. Cells were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 4\u00a0mM of GlutaMax (Gibco). For optical imaging experiments, colorless media (FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco)) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. We used CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher) for staining microtubules. For live-cell imaging, cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes (MatTek). For dark field imaging, cells were grown on cover slips and fixed after the treatment using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich). Trypsin\u2013EDTA(Gibco) was used for cell removal from dishes for quantification studies. For confocal experiments, FluoroBrite DMEM (Gibco) was supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin after staining with CellLight Tubulin-GFP (BacMam 2.0, Thermo-Fisher), while the cells were grown on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottom dishes supplied by MatTek. Cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma Aldrich).For determining the dynamics of GNP uptake, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells were plated in 6-well plates and left for 24\u00a0h to ensure adherence in the incubator. After cells were adhered to the bottom of the dishes, they were all incubated with  at 0.2\u00a0nM concentration in media for 1, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h at 37 \u0366C with 5% . After specific NP incubation time period, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times, trypsinized, and counted using a Coulter Counter (Z2 Coulter; Beckman Coulter) for the quantification purposes.For the retention study, cells were first incubated with  for 24\u00a0h time period. After the incubation with GNPs, cells were washed with PBS three times, added fresh media, and left in the incubator for a 24-h time period. Following the incubation with fresh media, cells were washed with PBS, removed from the dishes, and counted for quantification studies.To measure the gold content for each condition, the cells were treated with 65% aqua regia (3:1 ratio of  mineral oil bath for a minimum 1\u00a0h. Small amounts of hydrogen peroxide were added afterwards to ensure complete digestion of the cells and GNPs. These samples were then diluted down to 2.5% v/v acid content in deionized water and the gold content was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; Agilent 8800 Triple Quadrupole).Preparation of cells for imagingWe used both darkfield and confocal imaging to determine the distribution of GNPs. For darkfield imaging, all cell lines were plated on coverslips placed on the bottom of 6 well dishes. The cells were treated with  for 24\u00a0h to determine the extent of endocytosis. Upon completion of NP incubation, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20\u00a0min at 37 \u0366C. The cover slips were washed with PBS, removed from each well, and mounted to a glass slide using Prolong Glass Antifade Mountant. Each sample was imaged using darkfield microscopy and HSI (CytoViva) under a 60X objective.Live-cell imaging was performed using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 980) using a 60X oil immersion lens. For confocal imaging,  complexes had PEG-Cy5 (excitation 633\u00a0nm, emission filter 650\u00a0nm LP) conjugated as previously mentioned. To see general structure of the cell, microtubules (MTs) were stained with a viral transfection stain (CellLight Tubulin-GFP), which contains DNA coding for an \u03b1-tubulin/GFP construct. For live-cell confocal imaging, cells were plated on 3\u00a0cm coverslip-bottomed dishes in FluoroBrite media. For staining MTs, the cells were incubated in the viral stain for \u2009>\u200924\u00a0h prior to treatment with fluorescent  After NP incubation, the cells were imaged after 24\u00a0h of endocytosis. To determine the retention, cells were first incubated with GNPs for 24\u00a0h, removed the media, added fresh media, and incubated for 24\u00a0h. All imaging parameters (acquisition settings) used between experiments was maintained constant.Immunofluorescence assayOnce the cells were adhered to glass coverslips in 6-well plates, fresh media with or without (control) GNPs were added followed by a 24-h incubation time period. After the incubation time period, the cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed with 4% PFA for 5\u00a0min at room temperature followed by two PBS washes for 5\u00a0min each. The cells were then treated with 2% BSA/0.1% Triton-X in PBS for 20\u00a0min. The two primary antibodies \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 were diluted 1:200 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS, while the two secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 in 0.5% BSA/0.1% Triton-X/PBS. The coverslips were first incubated with a combination of the two primary antibodies on parafilm for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS three times. The cells were then rinsed twice with 0.5% BSA/0.175% Tween-20/PBS for 5-min time durations. Finally, the cover slips were incubated with secondary antibodies in the dark for 30\u00a0min. After the incubation time period, the cells were rinsed in PBS, dried, and mounted to glass coverslips with Prolong Glass.Statistical analysisA t test correcting for multiple comparisons using the Holm\u2013Sidak method was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. A p-value\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered statistically significant. All experiments were repeated three times and the data presented is the average.Supplementary informationAbbreviationsNPsNanoparticlesGNPsGold nanoparticlesRTRadiotherapyCTChemotherapyTMETumor microenvironmentFBsFibroblastsCAFsCancer-associated fibroblastsICP-MSInductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopyTEMTransmission electron microscopyHSIHyperspectral imagingUVUltravioletDSBsDouble strand breaksDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumPBSPhosphate buffered salinePublisher's NoteSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary informationSupplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12645-020-00064-6.Authors\u2019 contributionsAll authors listed have made substantial, direct, and intellectual contributions to the work discussed in this publication.

        "content": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are considered to contribute to tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. However, the cell type of origin remains unknown. Since human adipose tissue derived stem cells (hASCs) are locally adjacent to breast cancer cells and might directly interact with tumor cells, we investigated whether CAFs may originate from hASCs. hASCs cultured under different conditions were quantified for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin. ELISA was performed using the human TGF\u03b21, SDF-1\u03b1 and CCL5 Quantikine Kit. The invasion potential of MDAMB231 cancer cells was evaluated using a Boyden chamber with filter inserts coated with Matrigel in 24-well dishes. We demonstrated that a significant percentage of hASCs differentiated into a CAF-like myofibroblastic phenotype (e.g. expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and tenascin-C) when exposed to conditioned medium from the human breast cancer lines MDAMB231 and MCF7. The conditioned medium from MDAMB231 and MCF7 contains significant amounts of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and the differentiation of hASCs towards CAFs is dependent on TGF\u03b21 signaling via Smad3 in hASCs. The induction of CAFs can be abolished using a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b21 as well as by pretreatment of the hASCs with SB431542, a TGF\u03b21 receptor kinase inhibitor. Additionally, we found that these hASC-derived CAF-like cells exhibit functional properties of CAFs, including the ability to promote tumor cell invasion in an in vitro invasion assay, as well as increased expression of stromal-cell derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and CCL5. Our data suggest that hASCs are a source of CAFs which play an important role in the tumor invasion.",

        "title": "Regulation of Wnt5a mRNA expression in human mammary epithelial cells by cell shape, confluence, and hepatocyte growth factor.",
        "content": "The Wnts are a family of genes with a role in cell fate and morphological development in numerous embryonic and adult tissues. In mouse mammary tissue a subset of the Wnts have a function in the normal development of the gland, and aberrant expression of Wnts normally silent in this tissue causes mammary carcinomas. We have previously shown that Wnt5a expression is elevated in the epithelial component of proliferative lesions of human breast and have therefore examined the regulation of Wnt5a mRNA expression in the human mammary epithelial cell line HB2, which has a luminal phenotype and thus represents the most commonly transformed cell type in human breast cancer. Wnt5a was up-regulated 30-fold at confluence. This up-regulation was induced specifically by confluence and not by the growth arrest that accompanied it. In addition, Wnt5a was down-regulated 3-fold by changes in cell shape associated with the transition from growth on a two-dimensional surface (flat cell morphology) to growth in three-dimensional gels (spherical cell morphology). Cytoskeletal disruption with non-toxic doses of colchicine also induced a spherical morphology and brought about a dose-dependent down-regulation of Wnt5a. Wnt5a was also down-regulated 10-fold during the hepatocyte growth factor-induced branching of HB2 cell aggregates in collagen gels. The down-regulation of Wnt5a preceded the branching process. A similar result was obtained with primary human breast epithelial populations and the breast cancer cell line MDA468. We conclude that regulation of Wnt5a expression is a down-stream effect of signaling by hepatocyte growth factor. These results are consistent with a role for Wnt5a in mammary epithelial cell motility and are in accord with Xwnt5a's function in embryonal cell migration. If Wnt5a's function in human mammary epithelial cells is similar to that of Xwnt5a, its up-regulation at confluence may be a mechanism for inhibition of cell migration beyond confluence.",

        "full_text": "The Inferior Colliculus in Alcoholism and BeyondPost-mortem neuropathological and in vivo neuroimaging methods have demonstrated the vulnerability of the inferior colliculus to the sequelae of thiamine deficiency as occurs in Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS). A rich literature in animal models ranging from mice to monkeys\u2014including our neuroimaging studies in rats\u2014has shown involvement of the inferior colliculi in the neural response to thiamine depletion, frequently accomplished with pyrithiamine, an inhibitor of thiamine metabolism. In uncomplicated alcoholism (i.e., absent diagnosable neurological concomitants), the literature citing involvement of the inferior colliculus is scarce, has nearly all been accomplished in preclinical models, and is predominately discussed in the context of ethanol withdrawal. Our recent work using novel, voxel-based analysis of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has demonstrated significant, persistent shrinkage of the inferior colliculus using acute and chronic ethanol exposure paradigms in two strains of rats. We speculate that these consistent findings should be considered from the perspective of the inferior colliculi having a relatively high CNS metabolic rate. As such, they are especially vulnerable to hypoxic injury and may be provide a common anatomical link among a variety of disparate insults. An argument will be made that the inferior colliculi have functions, possibly related to auditory gating, necessary for awareness of the external environment. Multimodal imaging including diffusion methods to provide more accurate in vivo visualization and quantification of the inferior colliculi may clarify the roles of brain stem nuclei such as the inferior colliculi in alcoholism and other neuropathologies marked by altered metabolism.IntroductionAlcohol Use Disorder (AUD, 12-month US prevalence 13.9%; lifetime US prevalence 29.1%) is a common mental-health issue and a leading global cause of illness and mortality. Neuroscience research has aimed at elucidating the brain structures and functions that are impaired by chronic alcohol consumption as well as those that are amenable to repair with sustained abstinence. While it is recognized that alcoholism involves disrupted thalamocortical and pontocerebellar circuitry, the purpose of this review is to draw attention to a brainstem structure (i.e., inferior colliculus) that has long been recognized as involved in certain aspects of alcohol exposure and withdrawal, but which nevertheless warrants greater attention in the field. The midbrain tectum (i.e., \u201croof\u201d of the midbrain, also known as tectal plate, and includes the corpora quadrigemina comprising the superior and inferior colliculi) is relatively homologous in all vertebrates but has demonstrated an evolutionary trend toward increased complexity. In considering the role of the inferior colliculus in alcoholism, an overview of the its involvement in the neurological disorder Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome and relevant preclinical animal models is first presented. Other disorders are reviewed to highlight a potentially common mechanism of inferior colliculus vulnerability to disruption of normal energy utilization. The review concludes with a hypothesis that alcoholism is associated with reduced synchronization of thalamocortical and pontocerebellar pathways due to inferior colliculi pathology.Thiamine Deficiency: Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS)The phosphate derivatives of the essential, water soluble nutrient\u2014thiamine (vitamin B1) \u2014are required for a number of aerobic processes. The citric acid cycle, for instance, responsible for the regulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, requires thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP, also known as thiamine diphosphate, TDP); TPP is furthermore involved in production of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA. Thiamine has a half-life of 18 days; 2\u20133 weeks reserves in the human body are thus readily exhausted, particularly when metabolic demands exceed intake. Although rare in Western countries, thiamine deficiency expressed as Wernicke\u2019s Encephalopathy (WE) may occur in diabetes, cancer, hyperemesis gravidarum, HIV infection, and in the critically ill; it also occurs following bariatric surgery and in individuals with AUD. Classically, diagnosis of WE required the presence of a clinical triad of oculomotor abnormalities (nystagmus or ophthalmoplegia), cerebellar dysfunction (loss of equilibrium, incoordination of gait, trunk ataxia, dysdiadokokinesia and, rarely, limb ataxia or dysarthria), and altered mental state (mental sluggishness, apathy, impaired awareness, inability to concentrate, confusion or agitation, hallucinations, behavioral disturbances, or coma).Practically, WE symptoms are subtle and nonspecific and include loss of appetite, headaches, fatigue, concentration difficulties, irritability, and abdominal discomfort. Indeed, a retrospective analysis of clinical symptoms of patients diagnosed with WE at autopsy revealed that only 20% presented with the full triad of clinical features and 30% exhibited only cognitive impairment. Operational criteria to improve clinical diagnosis found that the presence of just two of four signs\u2014dietary deficiency, ocular motor abnormality, cerebellar dysfunction, and either altered mental state or mild memory impairment\u2014was sufficient to identify patients at risk of WE. The prognosis of WE critically depends on the time of onset and dose of thiamine supplementation. If left untreated (as is too frequently the case, e.g.,), WE can lead to Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome (KS), a severe, typically permanent, neurological disorder characterized by anterograde amnesia. The term \u201cWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS)\u201d is used to refer to the presence of both WE and KS, due to the close relationship between the disorders.Archetypal neuropathological reports of the thiamine deficient, WKS brain describe bilateral, symmetric lesions affecting periventricular areas, midbrain tectum, and hypothalamus. Although damage to the mammillary bodies is frequently present, it is not a necessary concomitant of WE. More contemporary post-mortem studies of WKS brains also report neuronal loss in thalamus (anterior principal and mediodorsal nuclei), basal forebrain, and cerebellar vermis. In acute WE, in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies recapitulate post-mortem findings in reporting bilateral, symmetrical signal intensity changes (hyperintense on T2-weighted and hypointense on T1-weighted images) representing edemic foci in medial thalamus, mamillary bodies, tectal plate (superior and inferior colliculi), periaqueductal gray, and tissue surrounding the third ventricle. Regions sporadically noted by imaging studies as affected in acute WE include the caudate, red nucleus, olivary bodies, cranial nerve nuclei, corpus callosum, cerebellum, pons, and cerebral cortices. Following the resolution of edema and inflammation of acute WE, quantitative neuroimaging studies indicate volume deficits in affected brain regions including mammillary bodies, other hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampus, cholinergic forebrain, pons, and cerebellum.Damage to the inferior colliculus, as occurs in WKS, implicates effects on hearing and the vestibular system. Case reports demonstrate impaired vestibulo-ocular reflexes and occasionally hearing loss in WE. A retrospective study of 26 WE patients (14 female) showed altered signal intensities in midbrain tectum (superior and inferior colliculi) in 38% of cases. The inferior colliculi may be especially vulnerable to rapid thiamine depletion, as may occur in the sequalae of parenteral hyperalimentation. MRI studies occasionally report overt pathology involving the quadrigeminal plate such as the presence of cancer or cysts (e.g.,), but quantitative volumetric measures of the quadrigeminal plate are scarce (cf.,). To our knowledge, MRI-based inferior colliculi volume in WKS has not been reported.Thiamine Deficiency: Animal ModelsAnimal models permit the study of underlying mechanisms, enabling researchers to better interpret findings from human studies. Two experimental approaches are used to model WE in animals. The slower approach uses a thiamine-deficient diet (i.e., feeding with a thiamine-deficient chow), which can take 3\u20134 weeks to produce symptoms in rodents. Behavioral symptoms can be achieved in just 2 weeks using a combination of a thiamine-deficient chow and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a thiamine pyrophosphokinase inhibitor such as pyrithiamine. Both models result in symptoms that mimic those observed in human WE, including weight loss, ataxia, seizures, and memory impairment.In rats, histopathological findings indicate significant neuronal loss and gliosis in the thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain (vestibular nuclei, inferior olives), and collicular plate; the basal forebrain, white matter, and cortical regions are also sometimes affected. Similar findings showing damage common to periaqueductal gray, mammillary bodies, and inferior colliculi were reported in cats; mediodorsal thalamic damage was reported in fewer than half of animals. Bouts of thiamine deficiency (1, 2, or 4) conducted in groups of three rhesus monkeys showed the inferior colliculi to be among the first affected structures. By contrast, damage to the mammillary bodies and mediodorsal thalamus was not evident even following four bouts of thiamine deficiency. A histological study conducted 6-months following resolution of thiamine deficiency in the rhesus monkey showed persistently significant neuronal loss specific to the inferior colliculi and midbrain cranial nerve nuclei. Longitudinal structural MRI findings in thiamine-deficient animals show similar patterns of brain changes including hyperintense signals observed on T2-weighted images in thalamus, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies, hippocampus, and colliculi. In cats and dogs, hyperintense lesions as a result of thiamine deficiency are also noted in thalamus and colliculi, as well as in cerebellum.A number of reports using thiamine deficiency models observed that the intensity of neurological symptoms and the extent and location of lesions is complex and can vary greatly among individual animals. Selective vulnerability of thiamine-sensitive regions has been ascribed to their high metabolic demand, associated with low energy (ATP and phosphocreatine), acidosis (reduced pH), reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) and elevated nitric oxide production, altered perfusion, compromised blood brain barrier integrity, and gliosis. The variously sensitive regions may be vulnerable due to unique underlying mechanisms (e.g.,). The edematous nature of inferior colliculus pathology, for example, may explain why it is detected early in the course of in thiamine deficiency by in vivo MRI, which is sensitive to brain injury caused by tissue edema.Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a prevalent, complex, dynamic condition with profound CNS effects. Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with decreased absorption of thiamine and impaired hepatic function, which may together contribute to subclinical thiamine deficiency. Genetic mutations of the thiamine transporters (SLC19A2/SLC19A3) or transketolase enzymes (TKTL1) may further predispose individual alcoholics to thiamine deficiency. Traditional clinical pathological methods demonstrate only mild cerebral atrophy and lower mean brain weight in cases of uncomplicated (i.e., absent diagnosable neurological complications) alcoholism relative to healthy controls.Quantitative studies, required to characterize the relatively subtle structural abnormalities caused by the direct effects of alcohol, have demonstrated greater mean peri-cerebral spaces in the AUD than in the healthy control brain. Stereometric studies have suggested that this reduction in brain volume is largely accounted for by the shrinkage of white matter. Cerebellar white matter volume, especially in the vermis, is significantly smaller than in control brains, and corpus callosum area is significantly thinned in alcoholics. Microscopic studies also reveal \u223c25% loss of pyramidal neurons in the superior frontal and frontal association cortices of AUD relative to healthy brains. Although neuronal loss in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus correlates with maximum daily alcohol consumption, pathological studies have not consistently shown a decrease in the number of neurons in cerebellum, basal ganglia, hippocampus, or serotonergic raphe nuclei.In general, cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of AUD report volume deficits in cortical gray and white matter and anterior cerebellum. Selective regions of frontal cortex are among the most commonly described volume deficits in alcoholism. Large-scale longitudinal MRI studies demonstrate AUD-related volume deficits in frontal, temporal, parietal, cingulate, and insular cortices with evidence for accelerated aging in volumes of precentral and superior frontal cortices. Although less severe, the AUD brain shows volume deficits in regions affected by thiamine-deficiency-associated WKS including mammillary bodies, hippocampus, thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. These graded effects suggest that AUD individuals carry a history, or \u201cscar,\u201d from subclinical bouts of thiamine deficiency. This hypothesis is supported with reference to neuropsychological performance in studies which categorize AUD individuals by the operationalized criteria for determining history of preclinical WE. Uncomplicated alcoholics meeting no WE criteria performed at normal levels on a large neuropsychological test battery; those meeting one criterion performed at impaired levels on a few of the test composites; those meeting two or more criteria were impaired on all test composites. Thus, although these AUD individuals had no history of clinically diagnosable WE, performance impairment level conforms to the \u201cdose effect\u201d of a WE burden. To our knowledge, only two studies provide evidence for effects of AUD on the tectal plate. A post-mortem neuropathological study comparing alcoholic to control brains (n = 9 in each group) demonstrated higher levels of gangliosides in alcoholics relative to controls in the quadrigeminal plate. In a computed tomography (CT) study comparing 327 chronic alcoholics to 419 age-matched controls, the cistern of the quadrigeminal plate was one of six parameters that distinguished alcoholics and controls.Animal Models of Alcohol ExposureRat models of alcohol dependence, typically using intragastric (e.g.,), intraperitoneal (e.g.,), or vapor (e.g.,) ethanol exposure, have revealed a variety of susceptible brain regions. Markers of degeneration typically highlight effects of ethanol on corticolimbic circuitry. Studies determining localized central nervous system (CNS) changes in glucose metabolism\u2014a marker for neuronal activity\u2014show a more widespread signature of ethanol exposure in auditory circuitry (i.e., inferior colliculus, medial geniculate), and structures including thalamus, cerebellum, and pons. Animals withdrawing from ethanol show elevated glucose metabolism in the limbic system (i.e., piriform cortex, amygdala, hippocampus), frontal sensorimotor systems, diencephalon (i.e., thalamus, hypothalamus), midbrain (i.e., inferior colliculus, locus coeruleus, median raphe), cerebellum (flocculus, paraflocculus, vermis, white matter), and brainstem (i.e., pons). Similarly, upregulation of immediate early gene (e.g., c-Fos) expression (another marker of recent neuronal activity) during ethanol withdrawal is observed in regions including the olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, inferior colliculi, cerebellum, and brain stem (; see also,).One of the most consistent, translational findings made with structural MRI in ethanol -exposed rodents is ventricular enlargement, which may be influenced by both timing and exposure method. Rats that achieve binge-like blood alcohol levels via gavage feeding show a larger effect than rats exposed to ethanol chronically via vapor. The effect on ventricle size is transient: ventricular volume recovers rapidly within one week of abstinence. A high field strength 7T animal scanner and voxel-based, rather than region-of-interest (ROI) based morphological evaluation demonstrated in animals exposed to binge ethanol exposure reversible ventricular enlargement and thalamic shrinkage but enduring shrinkage of pretectal nuclei, and superior and inferior colliculi. In a follow up study, two experiments [binge (4-day) intragastric ethanol in Fisher 344 rats and chronic (1-month) vaporized ethanol in Wistar rats] showed similarly affected brain regions including retrosplenial and cingulate cortices, dorsal hippocampi, central and ventroposterior thalami, superior and inferior colliculi, periaqueductal gray, and corpus callosum: volumes of the colliculi and periaqueductal gray showed persistent deficits with abstinence. Although the inferior colliculi, in particular, have been studied as a substrate for ethanol -withdrawal induced seizures, this recent study (i.e.,) demonstrates inferior colliculi shrinkage in the response to both acute and chronic ethanol exposure absent seizures and absent detectable thiamine deficiency (cf.,).Other Diseases Involving the Inferior ColliculiBeyond ethanol, lead, mercury, and methyl bromide poisoning can result in a WKS-like pattern of brain damage particularly affecting inferior colliculi and visual and auditory functions.Lesions in Leigh\u2019s disease\u2014a genetic neurometabolic disorder associated with reduced or absent thiamine triphosphate\u2014are cardinally present in dorsal midbrain (periaqueductal gray, superior and inferior colliculi) among other thiamine-sensitive regions (e.g., thalamus) and may be associated with disturbed hearing and vision. Indeed, a recent report describes a woman with a history of bariatric surgery with near total external ophthalmoplegia and hearing loss that resolved with intravenous thiamine treatment.Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which refers to the sequalae of alcohol abuse engaged in during pregnancy and is expressed as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autistic-like behaviors, and often exhibiting problems with vision, hearing, speech, and postural stability. Microcephaly is a common feature of FASD, but autopsy studies also report abnormalities of the corpus callosum, brainstem, and cerebellum as well as effects on hippocampus and basal ganglia. Post-mortem findings have been confirmed by in vivo MRI studies showing FASD effects on corpus callosum, basal ganglia, diencephalon, and cerebellum. Ethanol-exposed infant rodents and monkeys show brain damage to subcortical structures and cerebellum, with evidence for effects on periaqueductal gray and superior and inferior colliculi possibly via mechanisms of impaired mitochondrial function or oxidative stress.The complex developmental disorder autism may present with symptoms of oculomotor and auditory dysfunction. Some studies have shown involvement of the inferior colliculi (e.g.,) among other brainstem structures such as inferior olives, corpus callosum, and cerebellum and links to mitochondrial dysfunction and disturbed brain energy metabolism. In animal models, the genetic disorder Fragile X Syndrome likewise shows evidence for inferior colliculus involvement. Asphyxia at birth in humans and in monkeys results in disproportionate injury to thalamus and brainstem nuclei, particularly the inferior colliculi. In adult animals, the inferior colliculi are among the most frequently and seriously damaged regions in response to transient ischemia.A 1955 study using radioactive tracers to determine local cerebral glucose utilization in the cat brain revealed greatest consumption in brainstem auditory nuclei, nearly three times more than cerebral white matter and two times more than most cortical regions. Glucose utilization\u2014in species ranging from mice to monkeys\u2014has since been confirmed to be highest (among evaluated brain regions) in the auditory system, particularly in the inferior colliculi. Capillary density, blood volume, blood flow, and levels of glucose transport proteins (e.g., GLUT1) are also higher in inferior colliculus than in other regions measured. This high metabolic demand may be due to the involvement of the inferior colliculus in the integration of sensory inputs. High rates of blood flow and aerobic metabolism likely increase its vulnerability to toxic and traumatic brain injuries. Because a variety of syndromes with various pathogenic causes can have WKS-like neuropathology, and because the inferior colliculi are among the most metabolically demanding brain regions, it has been proposed that a common etiological factor may be energy deprivation as would occur in mitochondrial disorders.Inferior Colliculus: Structure and FunctionLocated on the dorsal surface of the mesencephalon caudal to the superior colliculus, the inferior colliculus is the largest nucleus of the auditory system. The inferior colliculus varies in size by more than 130-fold among mammals: relative to total brain size, rats have among the largest and humans have the smallest (; Figure 1). The inferior colliculus comprises core [central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC)] and shell (dorsal and ventral nuclei) regions. Both structures are composed of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic (\u223c25%) neurons. Vascular supply to inferior colliculus is principally via paramedian branches of the basilar artery.The inferior colliculus (yellow arrows) on sagittal images from a (A) wild type Wistar rat and a (B) postmortem formalin fixed human brain specimen. Images compliments of Adolf Pfefferbaum, M.D., SRI International.The inferior colliculus is one of the earliest structures to become myelinated and functional in the developing human brain. Histological studies have demonstrated that the statoacoustic system begins myelination at the end of the fifth fetal month in the second trimester. In mature newborns, the inferior colliculus, superior olivary nucleus, and lateral lemniscus are nearly completely myelinated. Early myelination of the inferior colliculi has also been demonstrated in vivo by MRI.Afferents to the inferior colliculus are excitatory and inhibitory (; Figure 2). Brainstem ascending inputs from the cochlear nuclei and superior olives via the lateral lemniscus generally terminate bilaterally in the CNIC. Additional afferents, which tend to be non-auditory, principally target the shell and arise from other brainstem nuclei (e.g., substantia nigra pars compacta, ventral tegmental area, dorsolateral periaqueductal gray, olivary nuclei, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe), spinal trigeminal nucleus (somatosensory input), deep layers of the superior colliculus, cerebellum, and target regions such as medial geniculate body, other thalamic structures (posterior limitans, suprapeduncular nucleus, and subparafascicular intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus), and auditory cortex. Indeed, a number of studies show that processing and integration in the inferior colliculi are significantly modulated by a massive descending corticofugal system. Efferents from the inferior colliculus predominately targeting ipsilateral medial geniculate bodies travel through the inferior brachium; 40% of projections to the thalamus are GABAergic. There is also evidence for efferent fibers to lateral lemniscus, periaqueductal gray, and superior colliculus.Summary of inferior colliculus afferent and efferent connections. Afferents: Ascending (later lemniscus): cochlear nuclei, superior olive, lateral lemniscus; Ascending (other): substantia nigra/VTA, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, pedunculopontine nucleus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum; Super Colliculus; Descending: medial geniculate, other thalamic structures, amygdala, auditory cortex; visual, motor, somatosensory cortices. Efferents: Ascending (inferior brachium): medial geniculate; Ascending (other): other thalamic nuclei, auditory cortex; Super Colliculus; Descending: auditory brainstem, periaqueductal gray.Positioned to serve as a relay station to analyze, integrate, and route sound signals to higher level brain centers, the inferior colliculus is also involved in multi-modal sensory perceptions such as the vestibulo-ocular reflex, and startle response. Specifically, converging anatomical and physiological evidence indicates that cells within the inferior colliculus are sensitive to visual, oculomotor, and somatosensory information as well as to signals relating to behavioral context and reward. Ethnologically, it is considered to drive acoustic-motor behaviors including predator escape, prey localization, and conspecific communication. The inferior colliculus may also serve to enhance perception by decreasing attentional thresholds and increasing alertness; indeed, arousal induced by sound can facilitate attention in a subsequent visual search, a behavior likely mediated by the inferior colliculus. The brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP) is easily recorded, has an invariant waveform and is stable and robust. Both human (e.g.,) and rodent (e.g.,) studies have ascribed the inferior colliculus as the origin of portions of wave V of the BAEP. A comprehensive discussion of inferior colliculus organization and function is beyond the scope of this review. Instead, the interested reader is referred to and.Inferior Colliculi: AUD-Related Neural CircuitryThe remaining portions will discuss the inferior colliculus in the context of alcoholism-related circuitry. Behaviors associated with the use of ethanol include an initial stimulatory effect and a prominent depressant action; alcohol abuse can result in tolerance and physical dependence, which may express as withdrawal comprising symptoms of tremor, hallucinations, motor and autonomic hyperactivity, and seizures. Critically, the inferior colliculus has long been described as involved in ethanol-withdrawal seizures, typically induced by an auditory trigger in animal models and supported by research in genetically epilepsy-prone rats. During ethanol withdrawal, inferior colliculus metabolism is elevated allowing for enhanced responsivity to acoustic stimuli, thereby providing a basis for greater seizure susceptibility. This is due, in part, to the fact that GABA-mediated inhibition, which normally limits high intensity firing of inferior colliculus neurons, is less effective during ethanol withdrawal due to downregulation or desensitization of GABA-A receptors and over-activation of NMDA receptors.Independently, work has implicated the periaqueductal gray in responses to ethanol exposure in animal models. Both the periaqueductal gray and the inferior colliculus may be involved in stress and anxiety. The quadrigeminal plate and dorsal periaqueductal gray and likely amygdala and medial hypothalamus are the presumed neural substrates of aversion, integration of defensive behaviors, and analgesia. In particular, the inferior colliculus, which can respond to both rewarding and aversive stimuli, is thought to integrate information involved in modulating fear-related behaviors via anatomical and functional connections with the amygdala. Indeed, neuronal activity in a circuit between the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal periaqueductal gray was recently shown to regulate ethanol drinking: inhibition of this cortico-brainstem pathway promoted compulsive (i.e., aversive-resistant) drinking. These findings, however, are derived from animal models.Although there has been some support for inferior colliculus involvement in seizures associated with Leigh\u2019s disease (e.g.,), direct evidence for their involvement in alcohol withdrawal in human studies is scarce. Instead, BAEP responses to alcohol indirectly suggest involvement of the inferior colliculi (e.g.,). BAEPs are particularly impaired in alcoholics with a history of seizures. Even in healthy human men, however, blood alcohol levels of 70 mg/dL were associated with depression of several components of the BAEP. Ethanol may have greater effect on the BAEPs elicited under inattentive than under attentive conditions suggesting that the generally observed depressant effect on BAEP is not due solely to the direct pharmacological ethanol but may be mediated or intensified by the general decline in attentiveness accompanying intoxication.PerspectiveAs described, our recent work using novel, voxel-based analysis of structural MRI data demonstrated in three independent studies [two ethanol intoxication models: \u201cbinge\u201d (4-day) via intragastric gavage and \u201cchronic\u201d (1-month) via vaporized ethanol; two strains: wild-type Wistar and Fisher 344 rats] significant shrinkage of the inferior colliculi. In Wistar rats exposed to the binge protocol, a single week of abstinence was insufficient for inferior colliculi volume recovery. Notably, Wistar rats continued to show transient inferior colliculus volume loss even after three cycles of 1-month vaporized ethanol exposure. In both intragastric binge and \u201cchronic\u201d vaporized ethanol models, earlier work failed to demonstrate quantifiable thiamine deficiency (cf.,).Volume loss in response to ethanol in brain regions sensitive to thiamine deficiency may be interpreted in several ways. (1) Ethanol-exposed animals could be thiamine-deficient transiently (i.e., missed data collection time point) or below detection levels. This interpretation would also hold for human studies which are even more challenging than those in animals with respect to capturing a clinically relevant time point (i.e., individuals with AUD may experience transient thiamine deficiency that is not captured in a laboratory setting). (2) Alternatively, circulating thiamine levels may be adequate, but ethanol may disrupt tissue absorption of thiamine. (3) Finally, high doses of ethanol may disrupt energy metabolism without affecting thiamine utilization. Ethanol, per se, is disruptive to cellular respiration. AUD is associated with decreased brain glucose utilization and increased acetate uptake. Evidence suggests that even heavy drinking promotes the use of acetate rather than glucose as a substrate of mitochondrial energy oxidation (cf.,). The ethanol-induced utilization of alternative energy substrates may initially target brain regions with high metabolic demand such as the inferior colliculi.Beyond primary sensation, the tectum is a \u201cperceptual facilitating apparatus\u2026.a vital facilitator of thalamocortical function\u2026\u201d (so that) just as cortical activity is dependent on thalamic integrity, so both also require the colliculi. It is this more general role\u2014that is, the \u201calerting\u201d or \u201cattention-focusing\u201d function of the inferior colliculus (cf.,) that is proposed herein to be the initial insult in alcohol addiction. Disruption of thalamocortical circuitry in AUD has been associated with craving, reduced arousal, and sleep impairments, whereas disordered pontocerebellar circuitry has been associated with impaired balance and visuospatial abilities. Thus, it is proposed that the primary impairment in alcohol exposure is due to a lack of thalamocortical and pontocerebellar synchronization by the inferior colliculi (Figure 3).Proposed alerting function of the inferior colliculus accomplished by synchronizing thalamocortical and pontocerebellar systems.A caveat to the proposed hypothesis is that most of the work highlighting ethanol effects on the inferior colliculi has been accomplished in animal models. A phylogenetically older structure such as the midbrain inferior colliculus may be more salient to rodent than human alcohol exposure. Further, the inferior colliculus is sensitive to anesthesia, adding complexity to interpretations of in vivo investigations requiring sedation. Alternatively, as already described, the inferior colliculi are a relatively large structure in rodents, but relatively small in humans making them rather difficult to study. To our knowledge, MRI-based volumetric analysis of the inferior colliculi in AUD has not been accomplished. In conclusion, although the contribution of brainstem nuclei (particularly periaqueductal gray, see) to aspects of alcohol addiction are now under investigation, it is recommended that greater attention be given to the potential contribution of the inferior colliculus to AUD.Author ContributionsNMZ formulated the ideas and concepts expressed herein.

        "content": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of cancer stroma, can confer aggressive properties to cancer cells by secreting multiple factors. Their phenotypes are stably maintained, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. We aimed to show the critical role of epigenetic changes in CAFs in maintaining their tumour-promoting capacity and to show the validity of the epigenomic approach in identifying therapeutic targets from CAFs to starve cancer cells. Twelve pairs of primary gastric CAFs and their corresponding non-CAFs (NCAFs) were established from surgical specimens. Genome-wide DNA methylation and H3K27me3 analyses were conducted by BeadArray 450K and ChIP-on-Chip, respectively. Functions of potential a therapeutic target were analysed by inhibiting it, and prognostic impact was assessed in a database. CAFs had diverse and distinct DNA methylation and H3K27me3 patterns compared with NCAFs. Loss of H3K27me3, but not DNA methylation, in CAFs was enriched for genes involved in stem cell niche, cell growth, tissue development and stromal-epithelial interactions, such as <iWNT5A</i, <iGREM1</i, <iNOG</i and <iIGF2</i. Among these, we revealed that WNT5A, which had been considered to be derived from cancer cells, was highly expressed in cancer stromal fibroblasts, and was associated with poor prognosis. Inhibition of secreted WNT5A from CAFs suppressed cancer cell growth and migration. H3K27me3 plays a crucial role in defining tumour-promoting capacities of CAFs, and multiple stem cell niche factors were secreted from CAFs due to loss of H3K27me3. The validity of the epigenetic approach to uncover therapeutic targets for cancer-starving therapy was demonstrated.",

Specifically, high rates of metastasis to the lymph nodes, lungs, bone and brain, not the primary tumor, are the leading cause of breast cancer death. Therefore, improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tumor metastasis may lead to more effective strategies for the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer.Growing evidence indicates that malignant breast tissue requires complex local and systemic stromal interactions to provide a tumor-promoting environment during breast carcinoma development and progression. Specifically, tumor stromal cells cross-communicate and develop an aggressive phenotype of cancer cells, which are recognized as an important modulator and even a driver of tumorigenicity. Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a key component of the tumor microenvironment, have been proven to be a major contributor of various processes, such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and drug resistance. These effects are mediated by paracrine stimulation from a variety of growth factors and cytokines, including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and interleukins (IL). Our previous study indicated that CAFs stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and impaired taxol efficacy in breast cancer by elevating NF-\u03baB/miR-21 signaling. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which CAFs feed the cancer cells and allow them to acquire an aggressive phenotype and the molecular mediators involved in these processes have not been extensively studied.In addition to the several well-documented gene mutations that have been associated with the development of breast cancer, considerable attention is being focused on the participation of epigenetic events, including the diverse activities of non-coding RNAs. Highly up-regulated in breast cancer, the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) mediates H3K27 tri-methylation and the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by recruiting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is considered a key molecule and potential biomarker for breast cancer. Moreover, HOTAIR is reportedly involved in drug resistance and stemness maintenance in breast cancer cell lines. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that HOTAIR promotes metastasis breast, pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma. Given its critical role during tumor progression, HOTAIR is a novel target for breast cancer therapy.The activation of CDK5 signaling has been implicated in the control of cell motility and metastatic potential, which are significantly correlated with several markers of poor prognosis in breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated that the aberrant activation of CDK5 signaling is associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer, which was responsible for high-dose taxol-induced invasion and EMT. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of CDK5 remains elusive. Moreover, CDK5 was proven to be essential for TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in breast cancer progression. Strikingly, aberrant CDK5 promoter DNA hypomethylation was identified in the mantle cell lymphoma genome compared with normal naive B cells. These findings indicate an interaction between CDK5 signaling and tumor stromal cells, which may underlie the novel epigenetic mechanism of tumor environment-induced metastasis and hold therapeutic potential in breast cancer.Based on these previous studies, we further demonstrated that CAFs promoted the metastasis of breast cancer cells via paracrine TGF-\u03b21, which is a crucial mediator of the interaction between stromal and cancer cells. Importantly, CAFs transactivated HOTAIR to promote EMT. Strikingly, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4. Additionally, CAFs mediated HOTAIR expression and EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling, and H3K27 trimethylation was highly enriched at the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. Overall, we describe the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the CAF-induced aggressive behavior of cancer cells, which support the targeting of the TGF-\u03b21/ HOTAIR axis as a novel strategy for breast cancer treatment.MethodsCell cultureThe human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CAFs were isolated and cultured as described previously. CAFs were acquired from four invasive breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TMUCIH), and the use of specimens was approved by the Institutional Review Board of TMUCIH. CAFs were obtained from tissues that had been cut into small pieces and digested with collagenase type I (1\u2009mg/mL; Sigma) and hyaluronidase (125\u00a0units/mL; Sigma) for 6\u2009h in DMEM without FBS at 37\u2009\u00b0C. After filtering the undigested tissues, the stromal fraction was centrifuged at 1000\u2009rpm for 5\u2009min. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) or RMPI Medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.Cytokine antibody arrayThe profiles of cytokines secreted by CAFs were detected in the culture supernatants using a Human Cytokine Array (RayBiotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cytokines with distinct differences in expression were screened out.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The culture medium was removed and used to assess the level of extracellular TGF-\u03b21 with a TGF-\u03b21 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, abcam) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results are expressed in ng/mL.Western blottingThe total protein was extracted with cold radio-immunoprecipitation buffer containing protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor. The cell lysates were separated using 8-10% SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Antibodies against human CDK5, CDK5RAP1, H3K27me3, EZH2 (1:1000 dilutions, Cell Signaling Technology), Egr-1, E-cadherin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin (1:1000 dilutions, Abcam), and \u03b2-actin (1:4000 dilutions, Santa Cruz) were used as primary antibodies. Rabbit or mouse IgG antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz) was used as a secondary antibody. The antibody-labeled protein bands on membranes were detected with a G-BOX iChemi XT instrument (Syngene).ImmunofluorescenceAfter various treatments, cells were seeded on sterile coverslips and cultured for 48\u2009h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\u2009min and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X 100 for 10\u2009min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA for 1\u2009h. Immunofluorescence staining was conducted with antibodies against \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and vimentin (1:100 dilutions, Abcam). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546 (Life Technologies) secondary antibodies. To detect the formation of stress fibers, cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 568-phalloidin. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscopes. Cells from three independent experiments in which at least 300 cells were counted were quantified.Quantitative real-time PCRTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the standard protocol. HOTAIR cDNA was obtained from total RNA using the Fast Quant RT Kit (TIANGEN). Real-time PCR was performed using Super Real Pre Mix Plus SYBR Green (TIANGEN) on an ABI-7500 Real-time PCR machine (Life Technologies).The following thermocycling protocol was employed: 95\u2009\u00b0C for 30s, 60\u2009\u00b0C for 30\u2009s and 72\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0s for 40\u00a0cycles. GAPDH was used as the internal control. Data are presented as fold changes (2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) and were analyzed using the Opticon Monitor Analysis Software V 2.02 (MJ Research).Wound-healing assayApproximately 2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MDA-MB-231 cells or 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates after different treatments. A linear scratch/wound was made on the cell monolayer with a sterile pipette. Photomicrographs of live cells were taken at 40\u00d7 magnification, and the distance migrated was observed after 48\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h.Matrigel invasion assayThe Matrigel invasion assay was performed in 24-well Transwell culture plates. Briefly, 40\u2009\u03bcL of Matrigel (1\u2009mg/mL, BD) was applied to 8\u2009\u03bcm polycarbonate membrane filters. Approximately 3\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MDA-MB-231 cells or 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 MCF-7 cells were resuspended and then seeded in 24-well Transwell plates containing FBS-free medium in the upper chamber and complete growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS in the lower chamber for 24\u00a0h or 48\u2009h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surfaces of the invasion membranes, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin. The average number of cells per field was determined by counting the cells in six random fields per well. Cells were counted in four separate fields in three independent experiments.Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)The expression of HOTAIR in paraffin-embedded sections and cells of different conditions seeded on the sterile coverslips for 48\u00a0h was examined in situ hybridization. First, we deparaffinized and rehydrated the samples. Before digesting samples with proteinase K, we used 4% paraformaldehyde to fix the paraffin-embedded sections and DEPC water to fix the cell samples. We then hybridized samples with a 5\u2019Cy3-labeled modified HOTAIR probe (6\u00a0ng/\u03bcl) overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. After completing the hybridization, the samples were successively washed twice with solution buffer (2\u00d7, 1\u00d7, 0.5\u00d7, chloride sodium citrate buffer) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min each. Nuclei were stained using DAPI, and the cells were visualized using an FV-1000 laser scanning confocal microscope.Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)The EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) was used to perform the ChIP assays. Briefly, 1% formaldehyde was used to fix cells, and 0.125\u00a0M glycine was then used to neutralize the formaldehyde. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors. Soluble chromatins of 200-1000\u00a0bp were collected after sonication and pre-cleared in 1:10 dilution buffer, followed by incubation with IgG, H3K27me3 and EZH2 anti-bodies on a rotating platform overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After washing the immunocomplexes captured by protein G-Sepharose beads, the bound DNA fragments were eluted for real-time qPCR analysis using ChIP primer.Luciferase reporter assayThe upstream 2.5\u2009kb promoter regions of HOTAIR were cloned into a luciferase reporter vector (GV238 vector), and the mutations of predicted SMADs binding sites were also cloned into the same luciferase reporter vector. Cells were co-transfected with SMAD plasmid GV219 vector and HOTAIR plasmid (wild type or mutant) for 24\u00a0h, and the promoter activities were examined with a luciferase assay.Orthotopic nude mouse models and treatmentBALB/c nude mice aged 4-6\u00a0weeks were purchased from the Animal Center at the Cancer Institute at Chinese Academy of Medical Science (Beijing, China). MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Lenti-HOTAIR or Lenti NC and CAFs were injected into the mammary fat pads of each nude mouse at a ratio of 1:3. The mice were imaged for luciferase activity with an IVIS imaging system once per week.Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry analysisThe paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to an immunohistochemistry analysis. After blocking with 3% H2O2 and non-immune rabbit serum, the sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4\u2009\u00b0C, followed by a streptavidin-biotinylated secondary antibody for 1\u00a0h at 37\u2009\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate was developed with 3, 3\u2032-diaminobenzidine, andhematoxylin was used for counter staining. The results were visualized using a light microscope.Statistical analysesSPSS 16.0 (IBM, USA) was used for all calculations. All values are presented as the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD. Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made using Student\u2019s t-test, and differences among groups were assessed with a two-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett\u2019s test. Significance was set to P\u2009<\u20090.05.*P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01.ResultsParacrine TGF-\u03b21 was essential for CAFs to promote the metastasis of breast cancer cellsTGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated cells. a Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of CAFs. b The top ten cytokine secreted by CAFs. Cytokine antibody array of culture medium of MCF-7 (c), MDA-MB-231(e) and by treatment of CAF-CM. Relative signal intensity of top ten increased cytokine in CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (d), MDA-MB-231(f), compared to the control cellsDuring breast cancer progression, CAFs may supply appropriate signals that may promote the development of aggressive phenotypes in carcinoma cells and establish a complex scenario, which culminates in metastasis. To identify the cytokines secreted by CAFs that enhance tumorigenic ability, the cytokine profiles of cell supernatants from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and treatment with conditioned media of CAFs (CAF-CM) were analyzed using a RayBiotech Human Cytokine Antibody Array. The top four cytokines secreted in the supernatant of CAFs were TGF-\u03b21, IGFBP-4, IGF-1 and PDGF-AA (Fig.\u00a01a, b). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 was the biggest increased cytokine in both CAF-CM treated MCF-7 (Fig. 1c, d) as well as in MDA-MB-231 cells, compared to control cells (Fig.1e, f).To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, the distribution of TGF-\u00df1 in clinic samples was performed (Additional\u00a0file\u00a01: Figure S1). It\u2019s well documented that CAFs strongly expressed \u03b1-SMA, whereas were negative for the epithelial marker cytokeratin. Immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin-7 and TGF-\u00df1 showed that the red fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 colocalized with green fluorescence of \u03b1-SMA, but not with cytokeratin-7 in both invasive breast carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. More important, much more and stronger fluorescence of TGF-\u00df1 was detected in invasive breast carcinoma, compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ. Collectively, these results indicated that TGF-\u00df1may be secreted by CAFs.Paracrine TGF-\u03b21 was enssential for CAFs induced EMT. a The amount of TGF-\u03b21 released into the cell culture supernatant of cells treated with CAF-CM was determined by ELISA. b The wound-healing assay of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, the TGF-\u03b21 inhibitor SB431542 (SB) or pirfenidone (PFD), respectively. c SB or PFD treatment impaired the CAF-mediated increase in invading cancer cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. d Western blotting analysis for E-cadherin, vimentin and \u03b2-catenin of cells treated as in (b). e Immunofluorescence staining showed that treatment with SB or PFD increased E-cadherin levels, decreased vimentin and nuclear \u03b2-catenin distribution in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. CAFs promoted F-actin polymerization and stability in cancer cells, whereas treatment with SB or PFD impaired the formation of stress fibers. Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcmDue to the changes of quantity and quality in CAFs from different patients, we extracted CAFs from four invasive breast carcinomas patients to reduce the original difference in this study (Additional file 1: Figure S2). MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were treated with conditioned media of CAF1#, CAF2#, CAF3# and CAF4#, respectively. ELISA further confirmed all of the four CAFs populations induced significant increased TGF-\u03b21 level in the supernatants from CAF-CM-treated cells (mean value: 0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 6.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.243\u00a0ng/ml in MCF-7 cells; 0.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01\u00a0ng/ml vs 4.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.14\u00a0ng/ml in MDA-MB-231 cells) (Fig.\u00a02a, Additional file 1: Figure S3). We then further evaluated the role of TGF-\u03b21 in CAFs induced EMT of cancer cells. We found that TGF-\u03b21 treatment achieved similar enhanced the migratory activity of cancer cell, compared with CAF-CM treated cells (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the small-molecule inhibitors of TGF-\u03b21, SB451332 (SB) or Pirfenidone (PFD) treatment abrogated the CAF-CM induced promotion of cell migration. Moreover, all of the four CAFs populations were competent in enhancing the cell invasive ability, while the number of invading cells was deceased 2- to 3.5-fold in SB or PFD treated cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 2c, Additional file 1: Figure S4). Moreover, SB and PDF treatment markedly rescued the induction of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin expression as well as the repression of E-cadherin in CAF-CM-treated cells (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescent images showed that SB or PFD treatment decreased the nuclear signals of \u00df-catenin in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the nuclear translocation to the cytoplasm was promoted (Fig. 2e). Furthermore, the remodeling and polarization of F-actin was observed after CAF stimulation, whereas the formation of a stress fiber pattern was abolished after SB or PFD treatment. These results identified TGF-\u03b21 as a crucial mediator of the interaction between CAFs and breast cancer cells and TGF-\u03b21 was necessary for CAFs to induce EMT of cancer cells.CAFs induced EMT by activating the expression of lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cellsCAFs enhanced the expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR in breast cancer cells to induce EMT. a The expression of seveal metastasis associated LncRNAs treated with CAF-CM was measured by RC-PCR. HOTAIR levels in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells upon treatment with recombinant TGF-\u03b21, SB or PFD was measured by real-time RT-PCR (b) or FISH (c). Scale bar: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. d Western blotting indicated that the EZH2 and H3K27me3 expression levels were significantly increased in CAF-CM-treated cells. e The expression levels of the indicated epithelial or mesenchymal markers in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were measured by western blotting. f The depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invaded cells, as indicated by the Transwell assay. Quantitation of invasive MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. For each measurement, \u2265\u200910 fields of view with \u2265\u2009100 cells were analyzed; *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01The epigenetic regulation of lncRNA triggered invasion and metastasis in breast cancer. To study the epigenetic mechanism by which CAFs induce EMT in cancer cells, the expression of several lncRNAs were measured by RT-PCR (Fig.\u00a03a). Specifically, CAF-CM resulted in the largest increases in HOTAIR expression, 3.5- and 8.7-fold increases inMCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, compared to the control cells. Similar to CAF-CM, recombinant TGF-\u03b21 also increased the levels of HOTAIR (Fig. 3b). However, the CAF-CM mediated activation of HOTAIR was attenuated after SB or PFD treatment. FISH images revealed that SB or PFD repressed the nuclear distribution of HOTAIR induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 3c), and Western blotting analysis indicated that the protein levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 were notably increased (Fig. 3d). Moreover, the induction of E-cadherin and repression of vimentin and \u03b2-catenin was observed in HOTAIR knock-down cells (Fig. 3e), and the depletion of HOTAIR decreased the number of invading cells, as indicated by a Transwell assay (Fig. 3f, Additional file 1: Figure S5). Based on these data, we concluded that CAFs promoted metastasis by activating HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which CAFs activate HOTAIR remain to be addressed.HOTAIR is a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4CAFs activated the transcription of HOTAIR by SMAD2/3/4. a Western blotting analysis of the effect of recombinant TGF-\u03b21, CAF-CM, SB or PFD treatment on the p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. b The HOTAIR expression upon treatment of siRNA against SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 was determined by real time PCR. c SMAD2/3/4 were enriched in the promoter of HOTAIR in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, as determined by a CHIP assay. d A bioinformatics assay showed the predicted binding sites of SMAD2/3/4 within the HOTAIR promoter region. e A mutational analysis of HOTAIR promoter activity. The wild-type and mutant promoter constructs were co-transfected with SMAD2, 3, or 4 plasmids into MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. The promoter activity was determined by a luciferase assayTGF-\u03b2 is known to assemble a receptor complex that activates Smads thereby assembling multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription. Western blotting analysis indicated that the levels of phosphorylated of Smad2 protein (p-SMAD2), p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4were significantly elevated in CAF-CM and TGF-\u03b21-treated cancer cells, suggesting that CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD signaling pathway (Fig.\u00a04a). However, the repression of p-SMAD2, p-SMAD3 and p-SMAD4 was detected in cells treated with SB or PFD. Moreover, RT-PCR showed a 50-60% reduction in HOTAIR expression in cells transfected with SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD4 siRNA (Fig. 4b). To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying CAF-induced HOTAIR activation, we used ChIP technology to identify the genomic locations bound by SMADs in cancer cells before and after co-culture with CAF-CM. The ChIP results indicated that CAFs stimulate the direct binding of SMAD2, 3, and 4 to the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4c), and a promoter analysis using JASPAR and PROMO indicated several candidate SMAD binding sites in the promoter region of HOTAIR (Fig. 4d). The relative profile score threshold set as 80% in JASPAR and the maximum matrix dissimilarity rate set as 15% in PROMO. Accordingly, the deletion of predicted binding sites (Mut-1 and Mut-2) within the HOTAIR promoter region decreased SMAD2/3/4 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the deletion of the remaining mutant binding sites did not result in significant differences compared with control group (Fig. 4e). Therefore, we concluded that SMADs directly bind the promoter site of HOTAIR located between nucleotides -386 and -398, -440 and -452 (the genome coordinates: chr12: 53975342-53975354, chr12: 53975396-53975408), and consequently induced the transactivation of HOTAIR.Based on these results, we elucidated that CAFs transactivated HOTAIR via the secretion TGF-\u03b21. Furthermore, we identified HOTAIR as a direct transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4.CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signalingCAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling. a Western blotting indicated that CDK5 expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 expression levels were greatly decreased. b The histone methylation status of CDK5 signaling was determined with a CHIP assay, which indicated that H3K27me3 was enriched at the promoter of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 in CAF-CM-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, whereas the depletion of HOTAIR blocked this function of CAFs. The results are presented as the fold-change over the control. c ChIP analysis revealed that elevated EZH2 was recruited to the EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. All experiments were repeated three times. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. negative controlWe previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. Consistent with our previous study, CDK5 protein expression was significantly increased in recombinant TGF-\u03b21- or CAF-CM treated cells, whereas the levels of EGR-1 and CDK5RAP1 were greatly decreased (Fig.\u00a05a). These findings suggest that the activation of CDK5 was essential for CAF-induced EMT. To investigate the epigenetic events that were involved in the activation of CDK5 in breast cancer, we first examined the histone methylation status using ChIP assays (Fig. 5b). Profiling histone methylation marks on the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter by qChIP showed that H3K27me3 is highly enriched at the promoter of both genes in CAF-CM treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells compared with the control cells. Whereas the depletion of HOTAIR rescued the effect of CAFs, the H3K27me3 levels at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter were remarkably reduced. Furthermore, the recruitment of EZH2 to the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was measured, which indicated that the level of PRC2 components at the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoter was significantly decreased (Fig. 5c). Based on these data, we demonstrated that the activation of CDK5 was required for CAF-mediated EMT. Specifically, CAFs stimulated CDK5 expression by H3K27 trimethylation on the promoter of CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1. CAFs transactivated HOTAIR expression to induce EMT by targeting CDK5 signaling.Knock-down HOTAIR inhibited CAF-induced tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivoThe depletion of HOTAIR suppressed CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. a Representative pseudocolor bioluminescence images of tumor size were obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors of MDA-MB-231-Luc cells were transfected with control shRNA or shHOTAIR. Each group included eight mice (n\u2009=\u20098). Primary tumor volumes (b) and representative bioluminescence images (BLI) (c) were evaluated. d Lung metastasis was detected by bioluminescent imaging on days 35 and 42. e Representative photomicrographs of H&E-stained lung tissues. f The expression of HOTAIR was assessed by FISH. g Representative images of the immunohistochemical staining of CDK5, EZH2, \u00df-catenin, H3K27me3, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 in tissues. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcmTo study the epigenetic mechanism of CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, an MDA-MB-231 orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established in nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging was monitored weekly and indicated that all of the four CAF populations remarkably promoted primary tumor growth, whereas shHOTAIR treatment markedly reduced tumor volume (Fig.\u00a06a-c, Additional file 1: Figure S6). Most importantly, CAFs resulted in dramatic lung metastasis with extensive tumor foci compared to control cells, as determined by quantitative bioluminescence images (Fig. 6d). However, this metastatic phenomenon was attenuated when HOTAIR was knocked down, and H&E staining further confirmed these results (Fig. 6e). Compared to the control group, CAFs enhanced the nuclear staining of HOTAIR, as revealed by FISH, which further confirmed our in vitro study (Fig. 6f). Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed the downregulation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin and reductions in p-SMAD2-, p-SMAD3-, EZH2- and H3K27me3- positive cells in the shHOTAIR group (Fig. 6g). Taken together, these findings indicate that shHOTAIR treatment efficiently blocked the crosstalk between CAFs and tumor cells, thereby impairing CAF-induced EMT. Collectively, these experiments supported the notion that the secretion TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs activated the TGF-\u03b21/SMAD pathway in breast cancer cells, resulting in the up-regulation of HOTAIR transcription and histone modification of the CDK5 signaling pathway, thereby promoting breast cancer progression and metastasis.Aberrant HOTAIR correlated with a poor prognosis and metastasis in breast cancerOverexpressed HOTAIR correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. a HOTAIR expression was analyzed by FISH. Scale bars in all images: 15\u00a0\u03bcm. b Immunohistochemistry staining detected EZH2, CDK5, CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 expression in 59 breast carcinoma samples (39 with lymph node metastasis, 19 in situ carcinoma)To gain a further insight of the role of CAFs in the clinical setting, we collected 59 breast carcinoma samples and examined markers of CAFs FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA by immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression levels of FAP-\u03b1 and \u03b1-SMA were significantly up-regulated in invasive breast carcinoma (97.5%, 38 in 39), compared with human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, 33.3%, 7 of 20), suggesting that CAFs facilitated tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer (Additional file 1: Figure S7). Compared to DCIS, HOTAIR expression and nuclear staining were higher in metastatic breast carcinoma, as revealed by FISH images, which indicated that the upregulation of HOTAIR strongly correlated with tumor metastasis (Fig.\u00a07a). Furthermore, the expression levels of EZH2 and CDK5 exhibited similar patterns, which further confirmed our in vitro and in vivo studies (Fig. 7b).DiscussionThe proposed model of the paracrine and epigenetic mechanism of CAFs induced EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. CAFs secreted high levels of TGF-\u03b21, resulting in the transactivation of HOTAIR in breast cancer cells, consequently enhanced metastasisBased on our results, we propose a model of the CAF-mediated upregulation of HOTAIR transcription in breast cancer cells that promotes invasion and metastasis via the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 (Fig.\u00a08). The hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b21 signaling clearly contributes to tumor metastasis and the metabolic reprogramming and activation of CAFs. Moreover, TGF-\u03b21 has been linked to poor clinical outcome and is required for the CAF-mediated initiation of efficient metastasis. Consistent with these results, our data further indicate that the key pro-metastatic function of CAFs depends on TGF-\u03b21 secretion (Fig. 2). Specifically, blocking TGF-\u03b21 secretion with SB or PFDefficiently abrogated CAF-mediated metastasis. Our study demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal and cancer cells within the tumor microenvironment.Non-coding RNAs have been added to the growing list of gene regulators that contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, mounting evidence has revealed that the up-regulation of HOTAIR contributed to drug resistance and tumor metastasis in various types of solid tumors. In this study, our experiment demonstrated that CAFs upregualted HOTAIR expression via TGF-\u03b21 secretion, supporting its importance in breast cancer progression (Fig. 3b-f). Most importantly, SMAD2/3/4 directly bound the promoter site of HOTAIR, as revealed by CHIP and luciferase reporter assay, suggesting that HOTAIR was a transcriptional target of SMAD2/3/4 (Fig. 4c and e). These findings suggested that the secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs clearly led to the transactivation of HOTAIR expression. And the breast cancer microenvironment plays a key role in maintaining HOTAIR expression in cancer cells. Our studies provide a strong body of evidence to support that the modulation of epigenetic control and targeted alterations of HOTAIR represent novel therapeutic targets in breast cancer.Extensive reports have identified several microRNA induced by CAFs (e.g., miR-26b, miR-148a and miR-133b) that were invovled in tumor progression. Specifically, our previous study verified that CAFs impaired taxol efficacy by activating miR-21 expression. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe that the CAF-mediated expression of long non-coding RNA led to enhanced cell migration and invasion.We previously reported that the active form of CDK5 kinase was responsible for tumor metastasis. However, the molecular mechanism of CDK5 activation has not been fully elucidated. In cancer, gene expression profiles revealed a loss of tumor suppressor gene expression due to aberrant histone modification. Specifically, Kumar et al. reported that H3 hyperacetylation at the promoter of CDK5 was a key mechanism underlying cocaine-induced plasticity in the striatum. In the present study, we proved that CAFs mediated the transcription of HOTAIR, leading to a strong increase in the H3K27-mediated trimethylation of the CDK5RAP1 and EGR-1 promoters, thereby activating CDK5 expression and EMT.Although our study focuses on the TGF-\u03b21, CAFs may also secrete a cocktail of additional pro-metastatic factors, such as IL-6 and IGF-II, to contribute to cancer progression. Moreover, additional crucial lncRNAs involved in the development of breast cancer remain to be investigated.ConclusionsCAFs may orchestrate multiple non-coding RNA and signaling pathways to control several biological processes in a paracrine manner during breast cancer progression. We reported here that secretion of TGF-\u03b21 by CAFs was a crucial mediator of the cross-talk between stromal cells and cancer cells to promote EMT and metastasis in breast cancer. Our study revealed a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying CAF-induced tumor growth and metastasis, the TGF-\u00df1/HOTAIR axis controls the development and progression of breast cancer, which supports the pursuit of these molecules as targets of breast cancer treatment.Additional fileAbbreviationsBCBreast cancerCAFsCarcinoma associated fibroblastsDMEMDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s mediumEMTEpithelial\u2013mesenchymal transitionFBSFetal bovine serumHOTAIRHOX transcript antisense RNAPBSPhosphate-buffered salinePCRPolymerase chain reactionPFDPirfenidoneSBSB431542Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12943-018-0758-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.Authors\u2019 contributionsMM,CSK and YR conceived and designed this study.

TNBC represents about 15\u201320% of newly diagnosed cases and its characteristics include a complex molecular landscape, aggressive/high proliferation, leading to poor prognosis and behavioral heterogeneity. The host immune response leads to rapid tumor growth, including breast cancer, which further hinders focal tumor treatments, favors recurrence, and reduces the survival rate. Additionally, the rapid development of TNBC can also lead to the development of internal hypoxia and subsequent necrotic core, where triple-negative tumors promote multidrug resistance (MDR) and worse prognosis. However, the role of the necrotic core still requires clarification.The important component of TNBC tumor stroma is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). As CAFs express a series of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins essential for tumor architecture, growth, invasion, and metastasis. In TNBC tumors, CAFs usually have similar morphology and gene expression pattern with myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts differentiate into CAFs under the action of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling. When normal fibroblasts differentiate into CAFs or myofibroblasts, they obtain \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression and increase matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion to enhance tumor metastasis. In in vivo models of breast cancer, CAFs has been shown to promote breast cancer metastasis development and progression. Therefore, research on CAFs has become a hotspot in recent years.A feature of TNBC as a desmoplastic tumor is the presence of a dense collagenous stroma, mainly comprised of stromal cells such as \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and the derived stromal components. It is well known that tumor vessels are usually embedded into the tumor stroma, which is the first and major obstacle against drug entry into the tumor tissue from the vessels. In addition, the stromal network can divide the tumor mass into different compartments, confining the drug to a limited space of tumor area, and then other tumor areas can regenerate and progress. Furthermore, the site where the drug accesses the tumor is also affected by the deposition of stromal cells and compact stromal deposition. Accordingly, CAFs are increasingly considered to be the primary noncancerous target for anti-tumor therapy, rather than a bystander.In the present study, we carried out a detailed investigation on the disease progression in the TNBC 4T1 tumor mouse model, and divided the tumor regions according to the degree of fibrosis. We also analyzed the pathway changes and the response differences of 138 drugs in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression according to clinical data. Finally, we compared the inhibitory effect of embelin on mouse breast tumors with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA. Our research will contribute to the understanding of the distribution of the 4T1 stromal microenvironment and its potential role in cancer treatment.Materials and methodsEstablishment of 4T1 and 4TO7 breast cancer cell line culture and tumor-bearing modelWe purchased the 4T1, 4T1-GFP and 4TO7 breast cancer cells from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and the cells were cultured as described previously. RPMI 1640 medium and HyClone dialyzed fetal bovine serum was separately purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA, cat. No 11875093) and GE Healthcare (Chicago, IL, USA, cat. No SH30079.03HI). We purchased BALB/c mice (female, 6\u20138 old) from Changsheng Animal Resources Center (Benxi, China). The animals were kept in a specific pathogen\u2013free animal room at Shenyang Agricultural University. For the transplantation of the 4T1 and 4TO7 cells, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 cells were suspended in 100\u202f\u03bcL 0.01\u202fmol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China, cat. no. P1022) and were injected subcutaneously into the mouse fat pad of the fourth mammary gland. The 4T1 tumor bearing-mice were sacrificed at 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21\u202fdays after transplantation. The tumor width (W) and length (L) were measured using calipers to monitor the total tumor volume (mm3), which was calculated using the following formula: L\u202f\u00d7\u202fW2\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4. All animal experiments were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. Vertebrate experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Shenyang Agricultural University (Permit Number: SYXK<Liao>2020-11006).Parameters for quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)Tumor RNA extraction was performed as previously reported. Briefly, RNA was extracted from 4T1 tumors using TRIzol\u2122 (Invitrogen, cat. no. 15596026) with column DNase digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was reverse-transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). qRT-PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs, 95\u202f\u00b0C at 5\u202fs, and 60\u202f\u00b0C at 30\u202fs for 40\u202fcycles. The following assays were used for amplification of the genes of interest with Mus musculus (house mouse) as target species- GAPDH, \u03b1-SMA, MMP2, PDGFRA, FAP, and TGF-\u03b21. GAPDH was used as endogenous control (for primer sequences, see Supplementary Table 1).Tumor histologyThe histological analysis method was consistent with that previously described. Briefly, the dissected tumors were fixed overnight at 4\u202f\u00b0C in 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, cat. no. P1110) and dehydrated using an increasing ethanol gradient, and then cleared in xylene. The 5-\u03bcm tumor sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and observed under optical microscopy (A1 Plus, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Pathologists diagnosed all samples in a blind review.Quantification of fibrosisSirius Red and Masson's trichrome are most frequently used to detect collagen in tissue. The tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained in Sirius Red for 1\u202fh, followed by cleaning in double-distilled water. Then, the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin for 10\u202fmin, and observed under a polarizing microscope (Nikon, Japan). Similarly, the tumor sections (n\u202f=\u202f3) were stained using a Masson's trichrome kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Solarbio, cat. no. G1345). ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Welcome) was used to determine quantitative tumor fibrosis.Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF)Tumor tissues samples were paraffin-embedded, fixed, and sectioned as described earlier. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate (pH\u202f6.0) via microwaving. Non-specific binding was blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin for 1\u202fh at 37\u202f\u00b0C, and then the samples were incubated with the following primary antibodies: \u03b1-SMA (D151012, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); cytokeratin 18 (D120229, Sangon Biotech; 1:250); cytokeratin 14 (D260178; Sangon Biotech; 1:50); TGF-\u03b21 (ab92486; Abcam; 1:100); and Ki67 (ab15580; Abcam; 1:150); MMP2 (ab97779, Abcam, US; 1:250); COL2A1 (D120453, Sangon Biotech, Shanghai; 1:100); PDGFRA (D151808, Sangon Biotech; 1:150). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies overnight at 37\u202f\u00b0C and detected using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated compact polymer system. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as the chromogen and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For IF, the sections were incubated using secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555 conjugated antibodies. Then, the sections were sealed with DAPI (4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)-containing sealing solution and imaged (Nikon NI confocal microscope). For the negative control group, PBS was used in place of the specific primary antibody for incubation.Pathological and molecular diagnosis of TNBCHuman Protein Atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.org/) contains antibody-based TNBC expression profiles. HPA was used to collect representative IHC images of \u03b1-SMA, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 14, TGF-\u03b21, and Ki67 in patients with TNBC tissues.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sourceMolecular data were obtained from TCGA Project (TCGA) patients diagnosed with TNBC. Transcriptome raw count data of the TCGA-BRCA project were downloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov) using TCGAbiolinks. Raw reads count data were normalized across samples using DESeq and \u22651 in at least 10% of the samples for downstream analysis. The patients with TNBC in TCGA were grouped according to high or low \u03b1-SMA expression (Table S2). The median \u03b1-SMA expression in the patients with TNBC was calculated in TCGA data, and \u03b1-SMA expression higher than the median was defined as high expression; otherwise, it was defined as low expression. Relapse-free survival (RFS) curves were depicted using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.Gene set variation analysis (GSVA)The GSVA approach was the same as in a previous article. TCGA data above were used for GSVA. GSVA score T-values of >5 were considered significant.Drug response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expressionDrug response was predicted using a previously reported method. The drug response was predicted for each sample based on the largest publicly available pharmacogenomics database, i.e., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC, https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). The prediction was implemented using pRRophetic and prediction accuracy was evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation based on the GDSC training set.Embelin-treated miceThe 20 mice were randomly divided into two embelin groups (4T1-embelin and 4TO7-embelin) and three control groups (healthy, 4T1, 4TO7), with four mice per group. Seven days after 4T1 transplantation, the embelin groups received daily oral embelin (CAS 550-24-3, 50\u202fmg/kg), while the control group received saline solution instead, which continued until day 14 of transplantation. The dose of embelin in this study was based upon the previous effect of embelin on body weight gain and toxicological study of embelin.Statistical analysisR version 3.6.2 was used for all statistical analyses. If the data were normally distributed, the measurement data between the two groups were compared using the independent sample t-test, and the measurement data of \u22653 groups were compared using Fisher's and Welch's one-way analysis of variance (Fisher's and Welch's one-way ANOVA). If the results showed that there was a significant difference, then the non-parametric test was used for comparison when the data were of skewed distribution. The data between the two groups were measured using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The screening criterion used was a p-value of <0.05.ResultsAnalysis of \u03b1-SMA expression/expression distribution and fibrosis in mouse 4T1 tumor based on time gradientQuantitative 4T1 tumor tissue fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA area.

These results have shown an average of \u00b1SEM.Fig. 2\u03b1-SMA and fibrosis are usually used as biomarkers to represent CAFs in tumor tissues. To clarify the contribution of \u03b1-SMA expression and fibrosis content to the volume of 4T1 tumors in mice, the mice were sacrificed and analyzed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 after primary transplantation (Fig. 1A). HE staining showed that the transplanted 4T1 cells were randomly implanted into mouse mammary gland tissue on day 1, but an outer layer of myoepithelial cells (MECs) of mammary gland epithelium proliferated significantly compared with the healthy mammary gland. There were significantly more fibroblasts in the 4T1 tumor tissue on day 3 than on day 1, and fibroblasts infiltrated progressively until day 21, indicating that fibroblasts play a key role in tumor cell expansion and tumor development (Fig. 1B). We also measured the fibrosis area of the tumor tissue at different developmental times. The amount of fibrosis in the tumor tissue on day 3 (1.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13%) was significantly higher than that on day 1 (3.03\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.42%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The fibrosis area in tumor tissue increased until it peaked on day 21 (25.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.93%, Fig. S1). Bright-field microscopy showed that the fibrosis surrounded the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). \u03b1-SMA was used to quantify CAFs, and the results were consistent with that of Sirius Red and HE staining (Fig. 1D). On day 1, compared to the healthy control, most of the \u03b1-SMA+ cells were concentrated in the MECs but also around the adipose tissue, indicating that the 4T1 tumor cells stimulated a part of the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. This significant increase in \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was also observed on day 3 (8.96\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.63%) vs. day 1 (1.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and on day 7 (20.85\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.87%) vs. day 5 (10.69\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.97%, p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S2). Pearson's correlation coefficient showed that the correlation coefficients between the amount of fibrosis and the area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs and tumor volume were 0.9722 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and 0.9075 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), respectively (Fig. S3). The qRT-PCR results of \u03b1-SMA were consistent with that of IF, but the qRT-PCR results showed that \u03b1-SMA expression on day 14 was significantly higher than that on day 7 after transplantation, while the IF results were not significant (Fig. 2P). Due to the heterogeneity of the CAFs, more known CAF markers were detected by IHC and qRT-PCR. The IHC results showed that the expression of COL2A1 (Fig. 2A\u2013E), PDGFRA (Fig. 2F\u2013J), and MMP2 (Fig. 2K\u2013O) in tumor tissue increased significantly with time since transplantation. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR results for PDGFRA (Fig. 2R) and MMP2 (Fig. 2Q) were consistent with that of IHC. The qRT-PCR showed that FAP expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 14\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2S); TGF-\u03b2 expression increased significantly from 1\u202fday to 7\u202fdays after transplantation (Fig. 2T). The above results show that CAFs were enriched in the tumor microenvironment in the early stage of the 4T1 tumor, suggesting that, in 4T1 tumor, CAFs are more important for early development rather than late development.\u03b1-SMA is co-expressed with cytokeratin 14 rather than cytokeratin 18 in the 4T1 transplantation modelImmunofluorescence histochemical analysis of cancer-associated myoepithelial cells in 4T1 tumor.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 3The 4T1-GFP cell line was used to determine whether the 14+ MECs were derived from the expansion of transplanted 4T1 cells. The IF results showed that cytokeratin 14+ MECs and GFP (green fluorescent protein) were not co-labeled in tumor tissue, indicating that the cytokeratin 14+ MECs did not originate from tumor cells (Fig. 3A). In the mouse mammary glands, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ co-labeling in MECs was only detected beneath the luminal cells. However, in 4T1 tumor tissues, \u03b1-SMA+ and cytokeratin 14+ MEC proliferation was observed in tumor tissues and first appeared on day 7 (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, GFP+ and cytokeratin 18+ double-positive 4T1 cells were restricted to the luminal cells, and most GFP+ 4T1 cells were negative for cytokeratin 18 expression on day 1 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, on day 7 of tumor transplantation, most of the tumor cells were cytokeratin 18+ and were not co-labeled with \u03b1-SMA (Fig. 3D).The spatial expression patterns of \u03b1-SMA, fibrosis, cytokeratin 18, and cytokeratin 14 in 4T1 tumorsTumor regional differentiation.

According to the degree of fibrosis, the tumors were divided into pre-fibrotic region (Fig. 4A), transition border (Fig. 4B), fibrotic core (Fig. 4C), proliferative region (Fig. 4D), and para-cancerous region (Fig. 4E). Cytokeratin 18+ cells were widely distributed in various regions of the 4T1 tumor tissues. The area of cytokeratin 14+ cells (0.58\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) was significantly smaller than that of cytokeratin 18+ cells (89.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Most of the cytokeratin 14+ cells were distributed in pre-fibrotic regions (1.68\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25%), with a few being distributed in the fibrotic core (0.08\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.05%) and proliferative region (0.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%, p\u202f>\u202f0.05). These results indicated that cytokeratin 14+ cells might play an important role in the progression of tumor fibrosis. The area of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs was largest in the fibrotic core (46.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.15%), followed by that in the proliferative region (15.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.85%) and pre-fibrotic region (23.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.85%), and was the least in the transition border region (3.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23%). The Masson's trichrome staining results were consistent with that of IHC of \u03b1-SMA. Fig. 3E shows the area of the 4T1 tumor bordered adipose tissue, within which cytokeratin 14+ cells could not be found, but the MECs were cytokeratin 14\u2013positive. In addition, most tumor cells were also cytokeratin 18\u2013positive. Further analysis of the data showed that \u03b1-SMA+ cells also infiltrated around the tumor, but fibrosis staining was negative around the MECs.Correlation between Ki67 and \u03b1-SMA in the proliferation regionRepresentative immunofluorescence histochemistry of 4T1 tumors and tumor tissues of patients with triple negative breast cancer.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)Fig. 5Ki67+ cells were present around the \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs. Ki67 was also negative in \u03b1-SMA\u2013negative areas (Fig. 5A). TGF-\u03b21 is a molecule that activates CAFs. We found that cytokeratin 18+ tumor cells in the proliferation region were also labeled for TGF-\u03b21 (Fig. 5B). Similar IHC results have been found in human TNBC. Spindle cells were present in the Ki67+ tumor cells (Fig. 5C). In addition, spindle cells were usually \u03b1-SMA+ cells and were abundant in the tumor tissues (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, TGF-\u03b21 and cytokeratin 18 were only expressed in luminal epithelial cells (Fig. 5E and F).The different expression of \u03b1-SMA in TNBC affects the activity of potential drug median inhibitory concentrations (IC50)GSVA and drugs response prediction associated with \u03b1-SMA expression (A) Representative images of different \u03b1-SMA expression in TNBC tissues were obtained from the Human Protein Atlas. \u03b1-SMA-H\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with high expression of \u03b1-SMA, \u03b1-SMA-L\u202f=\u202fTNBC patients with low expression of \u03b1-SMA.

Patients with TNBC with high \u03b1-SMA expression had significantly shorter RFS (Fig. 6B). We identified differences in \u03b1-SMA expression, revealing the myogenesis, TGF-\u03b21, and Notch signaling pathways (that is, the pathways associated with stem cell proliferation and differentiation) (Fig. 6C). Considering drug therapy is the common means of treating TNBC, we assessed the response of two TNBC subtypes to 138 drugs (Fig. S4). Among them, the estimated IC50 of 24 drugs had a significant effect on \u03b1-SMA expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) (Fig. S5). Rucaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor used as an anti-cancer agent. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to rucaparib (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and Fig. 6D). AZD6482 is an allotype selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) p110\u03b2. However, we observed that AZD6482 presented significant response sensitivity for \u03b1-SMA-L compared with \u03b1-SMA-H (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) (Fig. 6D). Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. \u03b1-SMA-H could be more sensitive to embelin (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). To verify whether breast cancer with differential expression of \u03b1-SMA had differing embelin sensitivity, we used the \u03b1-SMA high-expression tumor 4T1 and the \u03b1-SMA low-expression tumor 4TO7 in a drug screening animal model. The inhibitory effect of embelin on 4T1 tumor volume was greater than that on the 4TO7 tumor volume (Fig. 7A). At the same time, HE staining showed that embelin induced apoptosis in 4T1 tumors (Fig. 7B). Following embelin treatment, qRT-PCR showed significantly lower \u03b1-SMA and PDGFRA levels in tumor tissue than in the control group (Fig. 7C and D), indicating that there may be less CAF infiltration in 4T1 tumor tissue.DiscussionThe tumor stromal microenvironment is very important for TNBC occurrence and development, and it is also the first line of defense of tumor drug resistance. In the present study, we report the exhaustive characterization of relevant TNBC 4T1 mouse models regarding \u03b1-SMA spatiotemporal expression levels, cancer-associated MECs, and tumor division according to the degree of fibrosis, paying particular attention to the differential signaling pathways and different drug responses in patients with TNBC with high or low \u03b1-SMA expression.The 4T1 model is the closest preclinical animal model to human TNBC. The model is characterized by dense masses with mild anemia, thrombocytosis, and reticulocytosis in the short-term, and acute leukemia reaction with lymphocytosis and complement system activation in the medium- and long-term. Here, we supplemented the accumulation of tumor fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells to the characteristics of the 4T1 tumor. The quantitative results of fibrosis showed that 4T1 tumors began to accumulate fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA+ cells as early as day 1 of transplantation, and increased significantly from day 3 onwards. Interestingly, Reigstad et al. reported that 4T1 tumors displayed increased fibrosis levels and \u03b1-SMA+ cells, similar to the findings in our 4T1 primary tumor. Meanwhile, de Aguiar Ferreira also found that 4T1 displayed high level collagen I and \u03b1-SMA levels, as detected by IHC. At present, research on \u03b1-SMA\u2013targeting drugs based on the 4T1 model is increasing by the day. Our study also provides a data basis for studying SMA targeted drugs. However, using \u03b1-SMA as the sole marker will not identify all CAFs. Therefore, we will use multiple markers to study specific CAF subsets in future studies.4T1 is a highly aggressive tumor model of malignant breast cancer in mice. MECs are present in the mammary gland. They form a major population around the acini and ducts. In the pathological diagnosis of breast cancer, the existence of the MEC layer is a pathological hallmark of benign breast disease. In general, the transplanted mouse model pays little attention to MEC function and localization, while much previous research into MECs has focused on the spontaneous tumor model, for example, MMTV-PyMT, where MECs exist in the tumor tissue as cells that limit tumor metastasis. In the present article, these observations suggest that the origin of MECs in 4T1 tumor may be non-neoplastic cells rather than tumor cells, and provide a location for the 4T1 tumor cell enrichment. One interesting finding is that the MECs were enriched in the pre-fibrotic region and were arranged in an orderly manner. The pre-fibrotic region is a region where tumor cells are loosely arranged and extracellular fibers are enriched, into which a variety of immune cells infiltrate. According to these data, we can infer that the pre-fibrillated area is the excessive state from the tumor tissue to the fibrous core based on the gradient transplantation time. In addition, further research should be interpreted with caution to investigate the specific function of the cancer-associated MECs.PARP1 inhibitors, such as rucaparib, are used to treat TNBC or ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deletion. However, patients may have different sensitivities to PARP1 inhibitor treatment, and different treatment options are needed. Therefore, finding a factor with different rucaparib sensitivity has become a research hotspot in clinical practice. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were found less sensitive to rucaparib. In addition, compared to the patients with low \u03b1-SMA expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had downregulated DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways, which also participate in the activation of BRCA1. These results reflect that of Fang et al. who also found that TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator knockdown enhanced sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitor in cancer cells by downregulating BRCA1 and the DNA repair, E2F TARGETS, and MYC TARGETS signaling pathways. As 4T1 tumors express low levels of PARP1, they are resistant to rucaparib. Our results agree with that of previous studies reporting that rucaparib induces apoptosis in \u03b1-SMA+ fibroblasts and represses MMP1 and MMP2 expression.X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an anti-apoptotic protein that mainly inhibits caspase-3 activation. Therefore, the inhibition of XIAP expression may promote apoptosis. As a prototypical XIAP inhibitor, embelin is widely used in TNBC treatment together with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, combinations of XIAP and PARP inhibitors have an increased effect on apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by at least two times compared with each individual inhibitor. In the present study, patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were less sensitive to embelin. In addition, compared to the patients with low expression, patients with high \u03b1-SMA expression had upregulation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, IL-6\u2013JAK\u2013STAT3 pathway, and the myogenesis signaling pathway, all of which also participate in \u03b1-SMA activation. Those observations and ours are further exemplified in the work by Coutelle et al., who revealed that the impaired development of vascularized granulation tissue in embelin-treated animals was associated with a significant reduction in \u03b1-SMA\u2013stained myofibroblasts. Embelin inhibits dendritic cell function and limits autoimmune encephalomyelitis through the TGF-\u03b2\u2013\u03b2-catenin and STAT3 signaling pathways. This may be one reason the patients with TNBC with different \u03b1-SMA expression levels had different sensitivities to embelin.One of the most crucial differences between AZD6482 and the two drugs above is that patients with TNBC with low \u03b1-SMA expression were highly sensitive to AZD6482. AZD6482, an allotype selective inhibitor of PI3K p110 \u03b2, is used in combination with PARP inhibitor for treating TNBC. AZD6482 alone had no inhibitory effect on the MDA-MB-231 cell line. However, AZD6482 had an obvious inhibitory effect on a 3D MDA-MB-231 tumor culture model. Lastly, these results show that patients with TNBC can be further stratified by \u03b1-SMA expression\u2013based drug sensitivity prediction.ConclusionThe purpose of the present study was to determine the spatiotemporal expression of \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs at histological level in 4T1 tumors and to predict the sensitivity to 138 drugs in patients with TNBC according to \u03b1-SMA expression. Our results showed that \u03b1-SMA+ CAFs started to proliferate on day 3 after transplantation, and based on \u03b1-SMA level and fibrosis area, there was progressive formation of four different histological regions in the 4T1 tumor. Furthermore, this study represents a comprehensive examination of 4T1 tumor fibrosis at different times of transplantation. However, the generality of our results is limited. For example, \u03b1-SMA\u2013positive status does not represent all CAF subgroups. In addition, the corresponding clinical data we employed and collated are limited to TCGA data and literature. In summary, our present study increases our understanding of 4T1 tumor fibrosis and differential drug sensitivity in patients with TNBC.CRediT authorship contribution statementQilong Li: Conceptualization, Validation, Writing- Original Draft, Visualization.

        "content": "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin tumor in humans. Although BCCs rarely metastasize, they can cause significant morbidity due to local aggressiveness. Approximately 20% of BCCs show signs of spontaneous regression. The understanding of molecular events mediating spontaneous regression has the potential to reduce morbidity of BCC and, potentially, other tumors, if translated into tumor therapies. We show that BCCs induced in conditional Ptch(flox/flox)ERT2(+/-) knockout mice regress with time and show a more differentiated phenotype. Differentiation is accompanied by Wnt5a expression in the tumor stroma, which is first detectable at the fully developed tumor stage. Coculture experiments revealed that Wnt5a is upregulated in tumor-adjacent macrophages by soluble signals derived from BCC cells. In turn, Wnt5a induces the expression of the differentiation marker K10 in tumor cells, which is mediated by Wnt/Ca(2+) signaling in a CaMKII-dependent manner. These data support a role of stromal Wnt5a in BCC differentiation and regression, which may have important implications for development of new treatment strategies for this tumor. Taken together, our results establish BCC as an easily accessible model of tumor regression. The regression of BCC despite sustained Hedgehog signaling activity seems to be mediated by tumor-stromal interactions via Wnt5a signaling.",

IntroductionOver the past few years, the way we approach cancer therapy has dramatically changed. Several studies have contributed to switch the focus from tumor cells to the tumor tissue as a whole, including microenvironment as an active player in determining the tumor physiology and behavior. The tumor microenvironment has important biological implications on cancer initiation and progression, and it may affect tumor responsiveness to chemotherapy and control the antitumor immunity. In particular, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the major cell population within the tumor microenvironment, and they play a multifaceted role in various stages of oncogenesis. Through secretion of cytokines and growth factors, CAFs mediate proliferating signals and induce drug resistance in cancer cells. Moreover, they produce an extracellular matrix that physically supports tumor cells growth, avoids penetration of drugs, and prevents access to T-cells and macrophages. Considering their central role in cancer-stroma crosstalk, CAFs turned out as promising targets for novel anticancer therapeutic approaches aimed at perturbing the tumor microenvironment. A distinctive feature of CAFs is the high expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell surface glycoprotein of the dipeptidyl peptidase subfamily. FAP expression is detected in the stroma surrounding >90% of the epithelial cancers, including malignant breast cancer, while it is not expressed in healthy tissues. In cancer, FAP plays a role in extracellular matrix digestion and cancer invasion through its gelatinase activity; it is associated to a proangiogenic environment, and its expression has been correlated with tumor immunosuppression. Clinical trials failed to provide objective benefits from specific FAP inhibition, suggesting that blocking FAP functions may be almost irrelevant for cancer as a stand-alone therapy. However, exploiting FAP as a selective target for CAFs could still represent a promising challenge, by triggering specific and active delivery of cytotoxic drugs into these cells. Starting from this assumption, we developed a FAP-targeted nanotherapy against CAFs using a biological carrier for the pro-apoptotic drug navitoclax (Nav).Nav (ABT-263, Abbvie) is a pro-apoptotic small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w. It competes for the BH3-binding pocket of the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, avoiding them to bind and sequester pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX, BAK, PUMA, and others. In this way, Nav enables the activation of effector proteins, which induce permeabilization of the mitochondria outer membrane with subsequent induction of cellular apoptosis. Phase I and II trials have been attempted with Nav as a single agent, showing limited activity in small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors. Resistance mechanisms to Nav exist in several human cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer. As compared to highly proliferating cancer cells that frequently overexpress pro-survival factors, stromal components such as CAFs are more susceptible to cell death by Nav. Reasons for that have been attributed to the absence of MCL-1 protein and to a sort of \u201cmitochondrial priming\u201d in part due to upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins. This evidence has made Nav an extremely interesting compound for inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts, also suggesting that it may function toward CAFs in the tumor microenvironment. Despite being promising, the clinical use of Nav is hampered by its hydrophobic nature and by severe thrombocytopenia that makes it dose-limiting. For these reasons, an agent making Nav suitable for parenteral administration and limiting its off target biodistribution might avoid these restrictions and overcome side effects. Here, we explored H-ferritin nanocages (HFn) as a CAF-targeted drug delivery system. HFn surface may be easily functionalized with a variety of targeting ligands, thus driving drug delivery onto desired cells with molecular precision. Moreover, the usage of HFn as a highly biocompatible protein carrier has potential for improving Nav solubility and pharmacokinetics in the bloodstream, as HFn is highly soluble and stable in biological fluids. Last but not least, HFn may help with increasing Nav intratumor accumulation due to the natural tumor homing of HFn and to the nanoparticle-mediated enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The aim of the present study was to develop a FAP-targeted bionanoparticle made of HFn and loaded with Nav (HNav-FAP), and to investigate its targeting effects in cell culture in vitro. Our study revealed that the new HNav-FAP provided selective targeting of FAP-overexpressing fibroblasts over cancer cells and proved more effective in killing target fibroblasts compared to non-functionalized drugs. We also provided a preliminary proof of targeting efficiency in a syngeneic mouse model of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with functionalized HFn-FAP.2. Materials and Methods2.1. HFnHFn was obtained from Molirom s.r.l. (Rome, Italy) and stored at 4 \u00b0C for the whole duration of experiments. To check stability, the protein has been periodically centrifuged (10 min, 10,000\u00d7 g) and the concentration evaluated by absorbance analysis at 280 nm (A280, \u03b5/1000 = 458.34, MW = 509 kDa) using a NanodropTM 2000/2000c instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). 2.2. HFn Loading with Navitoclax (HNav)HNav was prepared by exploiting the metal ions affinity method, using Cu(II) as a complexing agent. Nav powder (ABT-263, Purity: 99.97%, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA; distributed by Clinisciences, Guidonia Montecelio, Italy) was dissolved in ethanol at a concentration of 4 mg/mL, aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Nav (100 \u00b5g) was incubated in sterile conditions on an orbital shaker with 10 mM CuSO4 obtaining a Cu(II)\u2013Nav complex (20 min, RT, 180 RPM). The complexed drug was added to HFn (1 mg) dissolved in a 220 mM NaCl solution and then incubated for 2 h at 180 RPM, RT. HNav was purified by gel filtration using a Zeba\u2122 Spin Desalting Column, according to the manufacturer protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy; Catalogue Number: 89890). The final protein concentration was assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy), while the quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, as described in the following paragraph. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 SD of 27 independent experiments.2.3. Determination of Nav by UPLC-MS/MS The quantity of encapsulated Nav was measured by UPLC/MS-MS (Waters Acquity UPLC & TQD mass spectrometer). HNav solution underwent protein precipitation by 100 times dilution in Acetonitrile, followed by 5 min vortexing and centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted 10 times with Acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2% (1/1 by volume), added with the internal standard Navitoclax\u221213C6 and 2 \u00b5L of the solution were injected into the UPLC/MS/MS system. The UPLC conditions were as follows: column Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 \u03bcm (2.1 \u00d7 50 mm) at 30 \u00b0C; eluent A formic acid 0.2% in water, eluent B acetonitrile-formic acid 0.2%; flow rate 0.6 mL/min; linear gradient elution, 0 min 60% A until 0.4\u2032, 2.5\u2032 30% A, 3\u2032 1% A until 4.5\u2032, 5\u2032 60% A until 7\u2032 (equilibration time). The retention time of Nav was 1.49\u2032. The linearity of the method was assessed between 5 mg/L and 200 mg/L in HNav solution. The MS/MS conditions were as follows: electrospray interface in positive ion mode; multiple reaction monitoring acquisition, m/z 488.16 \u2192 233.09 for quantitation, m/z 488.16 \u2192 176.67 for identity confirmation, and m/z 491.37 \u2192239.01 for the internal standard (CV 25, CE 12). The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) was 0.5 mg/L. Micro-dialysis samples were processed the same way but applying an initial dilution factor of five instead of 100 for protein precipitation.2.4. Preparation of Functionalized HFn-FAP and HNav-FabEmpty and Nav-loaded HFn have been functionalized by conjugating the variable portion of an anti-Fibroblast Activation Protein antibody (Fab@FAP, Creative Biolabs Catalogue Number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) to an HFn surface. Surface conjugation of Fab fragments instead of whole anti-FAP antibodies allows to reduce the overall size of the nanoparticle and achieve selective antigen recognition. Bioconjugation was performed using a PEG-based heterobifunctional linker (Malhex-NH-PEG-O-C\u2083H\u2086-CONHS, Rapp Polymere Gmbh, Tubingen, Germany) by a two-step reaction, adapted from a previously reported procedure. First, the Fab@FAP was reacted with 10-fold molar excess of the crosslinker in phosphate buffer (PBS) for 4 h RT on a rotator mixer and unreacted species were removed by washing with PBS in 30 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Then HFn was added to the reaction mix at 1:1 HFn:Fab@FAP molar ratio and incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 \u00b0C on a rotator mixer. To further optimize the preparation in terms of cell binding efficiency, two different lengths of the PEG linker (5 and 10 kDa) were used. The unconjugated Fab fragments were removed by washing with PBS in 100 kDa Amicon centrifugal devices (Millipore Corporate, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and functionalized nanoconjugates (HFn-FAP and HNav-FAP) were collected. Effective conjugation of Fab@FAP on HFn nanocage was assessed by SDS-PAGE and gel staining with the ImperialTM Protein Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Monza, Italy). HFn final recovery and the concentration of encapsulated Nav have been quantified by Bradford assay and by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis, respectively. The average number of Nav molecules per HFn nanocage has also been calculated. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of nine independent experiments.2.5. Raman SpectroscopyRaman spectroscopy was used to confirm actual Nav encapsulation into HFn. Raman spectra were recorded using an inVia Raman microscope from Renishaw (UK) equipped with laser light sources operating at 532/633/785 nm, as previously described. First, the spectrometer was calibrated using the band of monocrystalline silicon at 520.7 cm\u20131. Raman spectra were acquired from 12 \u00b5L drops of water solution of free Nav, HFn and HNav dried on top of CaF2 slides (Crystran, Poole, UK) without any further preparation. Spectra were collected using a 532/633/785 nm laser line of 6.25 mW focused on the sample using a 100\u00d7 objective for 10 min. The reported spectra correspond to the average of six independent acquisitions, after baseline subtraction and vector normalization.2.6. Transmission Electron MicroscopyHFn, HNav and HNav-FAP were resuspended at an equivalent protein concentration of 250 \u00b5g/mL in mQ H2O. A 20 \u00b5L drop of suspension was spotted on a Formvar grid and let drying at RT. Then, the grid was stained with uranil-acetate 1% for 30 s at RT and dried O/N at RT. Samples were evaluated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) at 220\u2013300k\u00d7 magnification. 2.7. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS): Size and Zeta Potential DLS measurements were performed using a Zetasizer Nano Instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) operating at 4 mW with a He\u2013Ne laser (633 nm) using a scattering angle of 173\u00b0, at 25 \u00b0C, as also described in. A disposable cuvette (optical path length: 1 cm) was used for the measurements of size, while folded capillary zeta cells (DTS1070, Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK) were used for Z-pot. The samples were dissolved in distilled water or Hepes 2 mM in order to optimize their ionic strength and be filtered before performing the analyses. Each sample was allowed to equilibrate for 30 s prior to starting the measurements.2.8. Analysis of Nav Stability in SolutionStability of Nav and HNav were evaluated by UPLC-MS/MS. Nav was first solubilized in EtOH (4 mg/mL), as done when preparing HNav. The drug was diluted either in PBS, PBS-2Captisol\u00ae 20% (Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), or EtOH at a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL (1mL of final volume). The three Nav suspensions and freshly prepared HNav nanodrugs were left settling for 1 h, then 100 \u00b5L of the supernatants were pipetted into sterile tubes and analyzed as described in Section 2.3. Percentage of recovered Nav from each solution was compared to the theoretical expected concentration used for experiments, set as 100%.2.9. Kinetics of Spontaneous Nav ReleaseNav release from HNav and HNav-FAP was studied by microdialysis according to the manufacturer protocol (Float-A-lyzer G2 Dialysis Device, MWCO: 100 kDa, Spectrum LABS, Compton, CA, USA). To avoid any bias due to different HFn concentration, this was kept constant at 300 \u00b5g/mL in PBS. Five mL of sterile buffer were used in the collection chamber, outside the membrane. Experiments were run at 37 \u00b0C in a shaking incubator to simulate physiologic drug release. At predetermined time points (15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 18 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 7 days), 5 mL of buffer were collected and replaced with fresh buffer in order to maintain sink condition. Nav concentration was measured by quantitative UPLC/MS-MS analysis from all samples (at each time point and from inside the membrane at the beginning and at the end of the analysis from the original sample). 2.10. Cell Culture Murine cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated from 4T1 breast tumors generated as described below in Section 2.16. After 21 days of tumor growth, tumors were excised and dissociated using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-096-730). From the single cell suspension, CAFs were isolated using the tumor-associated fibroblast isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l., Bologna, Italy; catalogue number: 130-116-474) according to the manufacturer protocol. Briefly, this includes a first incubation of the dissociated tumor with magnetic beads for non-tumor associated fibroblasts depletion followed by the positive selection of CD90.2-positive tumor associated fibroblasts. To check the isolation yield, the cells were fluorescently stained with CD45-FITC and CD90.2-PE antibodies and analyzed by CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Isolated CAFs were cultured in DMEM/Ham\u2019s F-12 medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% non-essential amino acids.Primary human activated myofibroblasts (HMfs) were isolated from patients with Crohn\u2019s disease undergoing ileal surgical resection, as previously described. Briefly, a biopsy of strictured intestinal mucosa was digested by incubation with 1 mg/mL collagenase A (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy), 50 ng/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics for 2 h at RT. After filtration through Cell Strainer 100 \u03bcm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), isolated myofibroblasts were seeded in tissue culture flasks and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 200 U/mL penicillin, 0.2 mg/mL streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids, 0.25% gentamicin, and 0.4% amphotericin B. Collection of human samples was authorized by the Ethical Committee of ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco university hospital (protocol number 0002846). All the patients signed a written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.Immortalized breast cancer murine 4T1-Luc2 (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy) and human MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26, ATCC-LGC Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy) were cultured in RPMI 1640 and in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) respectively. Both media were supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and were subcultured prior to confluence using trypsin/EDTA. Cell culture media and chemicals were purchased from Euroclone.2.11. FAP and TfR1 Expression by Flow Cytometry FAP and TfR1 expression were evaluated by flow cytometry on 5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube. For FAP, cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and 2% goat serum (GS, Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy)), centrifuged and then incubated with 1 \u00b5g of the Fab@FAP (Creative Biolabs, catalogue number: TAB-024WM-F(E)) for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed three times in PBS, centrifuged, and incubated with the secondary antibody (1 \u00b5g, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-human; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) in blocking buffer. For TfR1 studies, human-derived cells (MDA-MB-231 and HMfs) were incubated for 15 min with 500 \u00b5L of blocking buffer. Then, cells were centrifuged and 1 \u00b5L of anti-human TfR1 antibody (1 mg/mL, clone ICO-92, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Catalog Number #: MA1-7657) was added. Cells were washed two times with PBS, once in blocking buffer and incubated with 1 \u00b5L of secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog number #: A-11001) for 15 min at RT. Mouse-derived cells (4T1 and CAFs) were incubated with the anti-mouse CD71 antibody (Clone REA627, Miltenyi Biotec S.r.l.; catalogue number: 130-119-133), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Labelled cells were washed thrice with PBS and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Cassina De\u2019 Pecchi, Italy). Acquisition was performed on 20,000 events, within the selected region of singlets viable cells. Untreated cells or immunodecorated only with the secondary antibody were used to set the region of positivity.2.12. Cell Binding and Uptake AssaysTo study HFn and HFn-FAP interaction with cells, the protein was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate Isomer I (FITC, Sigma-Aldrich S.r.l., CAS Number: 3326-32-7, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To study how FAP functionalization regulates cell binding, cells (5 \u00d7 105 cells/tube) were incubated with the different preparations at the same HFn equivalent concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL HFn in PBS-BSA 0.3%, 2 h at 4 \u00b0C). At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described.Intracellular uptake of optimized HFn-FAP was evaluated with HMfs. Cells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen. Incubation was performed by adding 100 \u00b5g/mL of FITC-labelled HFn-FAP in culture medium supplemented with 1% FBS for 1 h and 3 h, at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (4%, 10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich) and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking solution (2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS) was incubated for 1 h at RT. Then, primary antibodies were incubated with cells in the same blocking solution O/N at 4\u00b0C: mouse EEA1 (610457, BD biosciences) was used at 1:1000 dilution, while rabbit Cathepsin D (ab 75852, Abcam) was used at 1:100 dilution. After incubation cells were washed three times in PBS (5 min) and AF546 labelled secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h (1:300, goat-anti mouse A-11003 and goat-anti rabbit A-11035 respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Monza, Italy). Images were acquired with 63x magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.13. Cell Extracts and Western BlottingFor the analysis of protein expression in CAFs and 4T1, cells were cultured for three passages after isolation and left to grow until sub-confluence in 6-well plates. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), containing 4% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche), 1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM NaF (Sigma-Aldrich), and cleared at 17,100 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. For the evaluation of PARP-1 cleavage, cells (2 \u00d7 105) cultured in a 6-wells plate were treated for 24 h with HNav or free Nav (1 \u03bcM) in culture medium. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 300 \u03bcL lysis buffer (2% SDS, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM EDTA). Approximately 30 \u03bcg of protein from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked in TBS with 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and then incubated O/N at 4 \u00b0C with appropriate primary antibody: rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP (1:500, Abcam, catalog number ab28244), rabbit monoclonal antibody to \u03b1-SMA (1:1000, clone D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 19245), rabbit polyclonal to Cytokeratin 19 (1:600, Abcam, catalog number ab53119), rabbit monoclonal antibody to PARP (1:1000, clone 46D11, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9532), anti-\u03b1-tubulin produced in rabbit (1:1000, Sigma Aldrich, catalog number SAB2102603), and anti-GAPDH produced in rabbit (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number G9545). After three washes in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were reacted with the secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Abcam) for 2 h. The bound antibody was revealed using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), and the chemiluminescence signal was detected using the Chemidoc System (Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis of bands was performed by ImageJ software.2.14. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCells were cultured until sub-confluence on glass coverslips pre-coated with collagen and incubated with HNav or free Nav for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C (1 and 0.5 \u03bcM of the drug were used for the analysis of apoptotic nuclei and for staining of active BAX, respectively). After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and then permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). A blocking step was performed for 1 h at RT with a solution containing 2% BSA, 2% GS in PBS. Activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX was analyzed by incubation with the anti-BAX active monomer monoclonal antibody (1 \u03bcg/mL, clone 6A7, Enzo Life Sciences, catalog number ALX-804-224) O/N in blocking buffer and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:300, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at RT in blocking buffer. Nuclei were stained with 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 40\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 or 512 \u00d7 512 pixel resolution through Leica SP8 microscope confocal system equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm. Apoptotic nuclei counted on DAPI-stained coverslips as a percentage of shrinked-shaped and DNA-fragmented nuclei over the total number of nuclei per field of view, as depicted in Figure S1.2.15. Nav Cellular UptakeThe role of the surface functionalization in regulating drug uptake was evaluated by measuring intracellular levels of Nav in FAP-positive and FAP-negative cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 were seeded into 12-well plates at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 105 cells/well and left adhering O/N. The following day, cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP in cell media with 1% FBS for 1 h. Cells were then washed two times in PBS and collected with Trypsin/EDTA. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (300 g, 5 min) and lysed in 150 \u00b5L of acetonitrile and sonicating the suspension in a water bath sonicator (6 cycles of 30 min sonication + 30 min incubation on ice). The suspensions have been collected and processed for UPLC/MS-MS evaluation of Nav content. Results are reported as average \u00b1 std. dev. of three independent experiments. 2.16. Cell Viability AssayTo evaluate the pharmacological activity of the nanoconstructs, cell viability was measured by MTS assay. CAFs, 4T1, HMfs, and MDA-MB-231 were treated with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP at different concentrations (0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 \u00b5M of Nav in cell media with 1% FBS) for 24 h (3000 cells/well, six replicates/condition, in 96-well plates). CuSO4 (used to load Nav into HFn) and the empty nanocarriers (either HFn or HFn-FAP) were selected as internal controls and incubated with cells at equivalent concentrations used for Nav-loaded nanodrugs. At the end of incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with 20 \u00b5L of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96\u00ae AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega, Madison, WI, United States; cat number: PR-G3582) diluted into 80 \u00b5L of phenol red free DMEM (3 h, 37 \u00b0C). Absorbance was then read at 490 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Percentage of live cells was calculated with the formula (Abs treated sample \u2212 Abs blank)/(Abs ctrl sample \u2212 Abs blank). 2.17. AnimalsAnimals were maintained in a fully equipped facility and used in accordance with the experimental procedures approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (aut. number 110/2018-PR). Seven-week-old female BALB/c mice were injected into the mammary fat pad with 1 \u00d7 105 4T1-Luc2 cells (Bioware Ultra, Perkin Elmer, Milan, Italy). Tumor growth was followed by caliper measurement and bioluminescence imaging. 2.18. Tumor Targeting and BiodistributionAfter 8 days of tumor growth, mice were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 5 mg/Kg of HFn-FAP previously labeled with Alexa Fluor 660 (A20171, Thermo Fisher Scientific). In vivo imaging was performed at 1 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV administration of HFn-FAP using an IVIS Lumina II imaging system (PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy) with the following acquisition parameters: excitation 570 nm, 605 nm, 640 nm; emission filter Cy 5.5; exposure time 2 s; binning factor Medium; f/Stop 2; Field of View: D. Specific AF660 signal was subtracted from autofluorescence signal thanks to the spectral unmixing using the Image Math tool available with the Living Image Software 4.3.1 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The quantified epi-fluorescence signal was reported as average radiant efficiency after subtraction of the fluorescence values measured in untreated mice.Blood was collected from the retroorbital plexus at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after IV injection, using sterile glass Pasteur pipettes, collected in EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to isolate plasma. Urine was collected into sterile tubes at 1 h, 2 h,4 h, 24 h after administration, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. Fluorescence was evaluated using a Jasco FP8300 spectrofluorometer (Excitation 665 nm, Emission Scan 695\u2013750 nm).Subsequently, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h to analyze the biodistribution and the tumor targeting of the administered HFn-FAP. The tumor and the major organs i.e., liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lung, and brain were collected and imaged with the IVIS Lumina II imaging system as described above. Finally, all the tumors were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for cryosectioning.2.19. Confocal Laser Scanning MicroscopyCryosections of 9 \u03bcm were obtained from excised tumors 1 h after HFn-FAP administration and immunostained for \u03b1-SMA. Briefly, cryosections were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (10 min, RT). Afterwards, samples were incubated for 1 h at RT with a blocking solution (2% BSA and 2% GS in PBS). The primary \u03b1-SMA antibody (rabbit mAb D4K9N, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was diluter 1:100 in the same blocking solution and incubated in the dark at 4 \u00b0C O/N. After three washes in PBS, anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300, A32731, Thermo Fisher Scientific,) were incubated for 1 h at RT in blocking solution, adding 0.2 \u03bcg/mL DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Thermo Fischer Scientific) to stain cell nuclei. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with 20\u00d7 air and 63\u00d7 magnification oil immersion lenses at 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel resolution using the Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with laser excitation lines 405, 488, 546, and 633 nm.2.20. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test in case of data that passed the Shapiro\u2013Wilk normality test, or with the non-parametric Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test in case of non-normal distribution of the data. Results are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE). The statistical significance threshold was set at p < 0.05.3. Results3.1. Cellular Model of FAP-Overexpressing CAFs With the aim of developing nanomedicines able to target CAFs, primary cultures of murine CAFs were isolated from dissociated 4T1 tumors grown in mice. The isolation yield and purity of obtained culture was checked by flow cytometry for enrichment in the fibroblast marker CD90.2 and disappearance of CD45 (Figure 1a, Figure S2). Due to the relative low number of CAFs (about 3%) as compared to the high number of other cells found in the tumor, we pooled three different tumors together to obtain a suitable amount of CAFs for culture establishment and expansion. Once in culture, the morphology of the cells, shown in Figure 1b, confirmed the fibroblast-like structure that can be easily distinguished from the epithelial-like structure of 4T1 cells (Figure S3a). We characterized the isolated CAFs by Western blot. As reported in Figure 1c, isolated CAFs expressed \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and FAP at higher levels than 4T1 tumor cells. Both these proteins are known to be markers of CAFs. By contrast, the tumor marker cytokeratin 19 was markedly more expressed in 4T1 than in CAFs. To further investigate the possibility of using FAP as a selective target for CAFs, we verified its expression by cytofluorimetry both in CAFs and 4T1 cells. As it can be seen in Figure 1d, 61% of CAFs were positive to FAP staining, while less than 1% of 4T1 presented surface epitopes for this marker. This result confirmed that FAP can be a promising cell surface marker to preferentially target CAFs over tumor cells by properly designed nanodrugs. 3.2. Development of Engineered HFn-FAP NanoparticlesHFn nanocages have been widely used by our group to deliver drugs to breast tumors. Here, we evaluated whether we could selectively control their delivery into CAFs, by functionalizing the nanocage surface with a specific FAP targeting moiety. We functionalized HFn nanocages with the Fab fragment of an anti-FAP antibody (Fab@FAP), thus minimizing the steric hindrance on the overall nanocage size. As illustrated in Figure 2, the process was divided into two steps: First, we conjugated the Fab@FAP with the heterobifunctional NHS-PEG-Mal; then we incubated the Fab conjugate with HFn previously labelled with FITC to be visible by flow cytometry. To optimize the nanoconstruct, we used two different types of NHS-PEG-Mal linker (5 or 10 kDa).First, we evaluated whether HFn surface functionalization effectively masked HFn epitopes. This should reduce its binding with the tumor cells, in which the interaction is promoted by TfR1, the natural HFn ligand, as previously reported. As it can be seen in Figure 3a, when incubating functionalized HFn-FAP 10 kDa PEG nanocages with 4T1 cells, the binding capability was significantly reduced as compared to bare HFn. This might be due to a partial masking of TfR1-binding epitopes after functionalization of the nanocage. The results obtained using 5 kDa PEG were less reproducible than the ones with 10 kDa PEG, thus suggesting more extensive masking of HFn epitopes with longer PEG. Therefore, the 10 kDa PEG was selected for the next experiments. PEG-mediated conjugation of the Fab fragment to the nanocage was confirmed by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4a). With the aim to further optimize the functionalization, we set up a reaction mix with five times more Fab fragments. The conjugation yield obtained in this case was not improved, thus suggesting that simply increasing the mole ratio in the reaction mix is not enough to increase the number of Fab moieties per single HFn (Figure S4a,b).Then, HFn-FAP nanocages (10 kDa PEG) were incubated with FAP-overexpressing CAFs to check target recognition. Cell binding was significantly higher with functionalized HFn than with the non-functionalized protein, as shown by 89% versus 32% of CAFs that were bound by HFn-FAP and bare HFn respectively. This result suggested that the high FAP expression on these cells drives the interaction with nanoconjugated Fab (Figure 3b). To further prove the selective binding capability of HFn-FAP nanoparticles, we included in our analysis two additional cellular models of human origin: human-activated myofibroblasts (HMfs, Figure S3b), where we previously documented stable FAP overexpression, and the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line (Figure S3c). Binding experiments confirmed that cells with high FAP expression (HMfs) have higher binding with functionalized HFn-FAP nanocages than with bare HFn. By contrast, cells with low levels of FAP expression (MDA-MB-231) have higher binding with bare HFn, where binding is mainly mediated by interaction with TfR1 (Figure 3b). Binding results were in line with surface expression of FAP in the cells (Figure 3c). As a confirmation, TfR1 expression was also analyzed by flow cytometry and confirmed in all cell models tested (Figure S3d). Cellular uptake of HFn-FAP was evaluated in FAP+ cells, showing that within 3 h of incubation, functionalized nanocages are internalized in the cell cytoplasm where they are found in close proximity to EEA1-positive endocytic vesicles (Figure S5). This observation recalls what has been already observed for HFn nanocages, which are rapidly internalized in endosomes upon receptor-mediated endocytosis.3.3. Development of HNav and HNav-FAP NanodrugsTo load Nav into HFn nanocages, we used a two-step strategy, based on the natural affinity that HFn has for metal ions. Together with the pH-based disassembly-reassembly, this is the most widely used method to prepare HFn-based nanodrugs. First, Nav was coupled with anhydrous CuSO4 (Figure 4a). Then, the complex was incubated with HFn and, thanks to the protein affinity for metal dications, it was efficiently loaded inside the nanocage. The so-formed nanodrug (HNav) was purified from unreacted drug by gel-filtration. After purification, the functionalized nanodrug (HNav-FAP) was prepared by incubating HNav with the Fab@FAP as described above for bare HFn, avoiding any freeze-thaw process to improve stability and process yield. We quantified HFn recovery and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) by UPLC MS/MS after each step of the nanodrug preparation. Table 1 shows that both HFn recovery and Nav encapsulation are quite high. The highest protein loss was observed during the first step of drug encapsulation, probably due to a partial protein collapse in solution caused by high Nav hydrophobicity. In terms of Nav recovery, the encapsulation efficiency was reduced in the functionalization step. The loss during this step could be explained by a possible release of the drug during the reaction. Consequently, the average number of Nav molecules per HFn in the functionalized nanodrug was lower than in the non-functionalized one (48.7 \u00b1 18.5 for HNav-FAP against 64.1 \u00b1 5.7 for HNav). We also characterized HNav and HNav-FAP by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and DLS. In the Raman spectra of the free drug and HFn, we found characteristic peaks of the two components at 1604 and 975 cm\u22121, respectively (blue and orange highlights, Figure 5b). The presence of both peaks in the spectra of the nanodrug confirmed the encapsulation of Nav inside the protein. Moreover, analysis of TEM micrographs of HFn, HNav, and HNav-FAP (Figure 4c\u2013e respectively) confirmed that during the encapsulation and functionalization processes the characteristic hollow sphere nanocage structure of HFn was not modified. DLS and Z-potential (Figure 4f and Table 2) confirmed that the diameters of HFn, HFn-FAP, and HNav-FAP were all in the range of 12\u201313 nm, with slightly negative surface charges and that the functionalization with the FAP antibody fragments did not contribute to significant change in the characteristics of the nanocages.To complete the characterization of the nanodrug, we assessed whether the nanoformulation improved water solubility of Nav. To do this, we measured by UPLC-MS/MS the amount of drug recovered in the supernatant of Nav and HNav preparations after synthesis (Figure 5a). Nav amount recovered in PBS solution was very low, due to the rapid precipitation of the molecule caused by its hydrophobic character. By contrast, once encapsulated into HFn nanocage, Nav stability was strongly increased, leading to almost 100% of Nav recovered in the solution. HNav stability was comparable to that obtained after adding the stabilizing agent Captisol\u00ae to the Nav-PBS preparation, which was able to increase the Nav solubility up to 91%. These percentages were compared with what was obtained after dissolving Nav in EtOH, where Nav is completely soluble (100%). This result represents a promising advantage towards full preclinical assessment of Nav, considering that in vivo administration is currently hampered by the hydrophobic character of this drug.Finally, we analyzed the kinetics of Nav release from the nanocage, performing a microdialysis experiment with both HNav and HNav-FAP. The release profiles reported in Figure 5b show that 20\u201325% of Nav was released within the first 2\u20133 h, then the release kinetics slowed down, exhibiting a hyperbolic curve profile. After 7 days at 37 \u00b0C, a certain amount of Nav was still recovered inside the microdialysis system (49% for HNav and 15% for HNav-FAP). The relatively slow release observed for both functionalized and non-functionalized nanodrugs suggested that both preparations were suitable for drug delivery purposes. 3.4. The Pro-Apoptotic Activity of HNavAfter the synthesis and characterization of the nanodrugs, we investigated whether Nav loading into HFn did not alter the molecular activity of the drug itself. Cells were treated with Nav or HNav, and immunofluorescence was examined to determine the pro-apoptotic effect of the nanodrug on cells in culture. Besides CAFs and 4T1 cells, we included in this analysis MDA-MB-231 as a control for human cells, which is known to be extremely sensitive to Nav, following previously documented reports. As assessed by morphological analysis of cell nuclei, both Nav and HNav markedly induced apoptotic cell death in CAFs and MDA-MB-231 (Figure 6a). On the contrary, almost no effect was observed in 4T1 cells, where a very low percentage of apoptotic nuclei was found in both treatment groups. It has to be noted that the percentage of apoptotic nuclei in MDA-MB-231 was higher upon treatment with HNav as compared to an equal dose of free Nav. We hypothesized that this effect might be related to the specific tumor-targeting capability of HFn nanovector. By binding to the TfR1 receptor, overexpressed in many tumor cells (including the MDA-MB-231), HFn is able to rapidly deliver its payload into the target cells, working like a Trojan horse. Through this mechanism, HNav could achieve a massive accumulation into the cell cytoplasm, where the drug exerts its activity, thus showing enhanced pro-apoptotic activity compared to the free drug. To confirm that treated cells were undergoing caspase-dependent apoptosis, we analyzed the caspase-dependent cleavage of the nuclear protein PARP-1, a hallmark of apoptotic cell death. Immunoblot results shown in Figure 6b and Figure S6 display the appearance of PARP-1 cleaved fraction upon treatment of CAFs and MDA-MB-231 with Nav and HNav, while control untreated cells only displayed one band corresponding to the full-length protein. 4T1 cancer cells showed no PARP-1 cleavage upon treatment with either Nav or HNav, further demonstrating no activity of the compound in these cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of action of HNav, we analyzed the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in CAFs treated with Nav or HNav. The immunofluorescence revealed that both Nav and HNav induced BAX activation in treated cells, thus confirming activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Figure 6c,d). A higher percentage of cells stained for active BAX was observed upon HNav compared to Nav alone, likely suggesting different kinetics of activity for HNav that may deserve further investigations in the future.3.5. HNav-FAP Enhances Therapeutic Potential of Nav against FAP-Overexpressing FibroblastsTo study whether the elevated binding with HFn-FAP observed in FAP+ cells could be translated into a higher drug efficacy, we evaluated cell viability after 24 h of incubation with Nav, HNav and HNav-FAP. Data reported in Figure 7a,b confirmed that HNav-FAP was significantly more active than HNav and the free drug in FAP-overexpressing cell models (CAFs and HMfs). In CAFs, significant differences were observed for HNav-FAP at 2 \u00b5M, with only 19% of viable cells, as compared to 32% and 35% when incubated with HNav and Nav, respectively. Similarly, HNav-FAP significantly inhibited cell viability more than HNav and Nav in HMfs. Here, the advantage of HNav-FAP was observed even at lower concentrations, down to 0.5 \u00b5M, probably due to higher FAP expression in these cells. As a control, we incubated HMfs with equivalent concentrations of bare HFn and HFn-FAP, and we found that the empty nanocages did not induce any toxic effect in the cells (Figure S7). These results also confirmed that targeting FAP by HFn-FAP does not have any effect on cell viability. No differences in cell viability were observed in FAP\u2212 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where the three formulations had similar activity profiles (Figure 7c,d). Comparing the different cells, MDA-MB-231 cells were the most sensitive to Nav activity with no differences among the three formulations down to 0.5 \u00b5M drug concentration; only at the lowest 0.05 \u00b5M concentration, HNav was significantly more active than free Nav (Figure 7c). The viability of resistant 4T1 was only slightly affected at the highest concentration of 2 \u00b5M for all the different preparations (Figure 7d). To exclude any influence in cell viability caused by CuSO4 used to prepare the nanodrugs, we incubated the highly Nav-responding MDA-MB-231 with equivalent concentrations of CuSO4 (either bare or in combination with HFn), without finding any effect on cell viability and metabolism (Figure S8).These results confirmed the reliability of the FAP-targeting strategy in enhancing selective drug efficacy in cells expressing high levels of the target protein, while the functionalization did not improve the nanodrug efficacy in FAP\u2212 cells.Next, we studied if the different viability observed upon treatment with HNav-FAP was correlated with a higher drug uptake in FAP-overexpressing cells. HMfs and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 1 \u00b5M Nav, HNav, or HNav-FAP, and the intracellular drug concentration was measured by UPLC/MS-MS analysis after 1 h. Figure 8 shows that after 1 h incubation, HNav-FAP intracellular concentration was four-fold higher than Nav and HNav in FAP+ HMfs cells. This initial \u201cburst\u201d could be due to the active role of anti-FAP functionalization that allows a more rapid uptake of the drug inside target cells. In contrast, the intracellular Nav concentration in FAP-negative MDA-MB-231 cells measured after treatment with HNav-FAP was similar to the one observed with Nav and HNav. This result suggests that FAP targeting plays an active role in the cellular uptake of the nanodrug only in FAP+ cells. 3.6. HFn-FAP Biodistribution in a Syngeneic Model of TNBCTo preliminarily evaluate the potential of our nanoconstruct in vivo, we injected fluorescently labelled HFn-FAP into the tail vein of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and monitored their biodistribution by fluorescence imaging at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h. The tumor targeting of HFn-FAP was clearly appreciated by ex vivo imaging of tumors (Figure 9). We observed a strong intratumoral signal at 1 h and 4 h after administration, while the fluorescence progressively decreased in intensity at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (Figure 9a,b). The intratumor distribution of HFn-FAP was confirmed by confocal microscopy, where a specific signal throughout the whole section was observed (in purple, Figure 9c). To get a preliminary evaluation of whether the functionalization allowed HFn-FAP to target CAFs in vivo, we stained tumor sections with the fibroblast marker \u03b1-SMA. A partial co-localization of the nanocage signal (purple) with \u03b1-SMA signal (in green) was observed in some cells, thus supporting the targeting capability of HFn-FAP (white arrowheads, Figure 9d).Systemic biodistribution of HFn-FAP demonstrated that nanoparticles were also captured by the liver during the first hours post-injection, as shown by intense fluorescence signal in this organ that almost covered the fluorescence of the tumor when imaging the mice in vivo (Figure S9). HFn-FAP were rapidly metabolized by the liver after 4 h, with merely detectable signal in the liver 24 h later (Figures S9 and S10). An intense fluorescent signal was also detected in the bladder of mice and in the urine samples at 1 h and 4 h, thus indicating a clearance by the urinary tract (Figure S9). Accordingly, some detectable signal was recorded in the kidneys excised at 1 h post-injection (Figure S10). We compared our results with the ones published for non-functionalized HFn and found very similar biodistribution and clearance kinetics, suggesting that the functionalization with Fab@FAP moiety does not modify the overall biodistribution and clearance of the particles.4. DiscussionMany types of nanoparticulate delivery systems have been introduced preclinically for the development of smart anti-cancer treatments. The main advantages of this approach are (i) promoting specific target delivery by surface functionalization of the nanoagents, thus reducing side effects, and (ii) allowing the encapsulation of insoluble drugs, thus making them usable for parenteral administration. In this study, we combined both advantages and developed new HFn-based nanodrugs functionalized with FAP-targeting ligands able to enhance Navitoclax delivery into FAP-overexpressing CAFs target cells. In fact, several works have highlighted the key role that CAFs play in promoting cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis in many types of solid tumors, including breast cancer. For these reasons, the development of safe and reliable strategies able to target CAFs could be a powerful approach to help control growth and spreading of many types of aggressive cancers. Pro-tumorigenic CAFs display overexpression of the membrane protein FAP. This is why FAP is emerging as a promising antigen for smart CAF-targeted therapeutic strategies. Different immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to block FAP proteolytic activity, thus preventing tumor growth and proliferation. However, therapeutic efficacy has not met initial expectations and clinical translation is still very limited, probably due to the small impact of such strategy in the overall complexity of phenomena regulating tumor growth. More promising results are emerging using FAP as a target moiety to prompt selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into CAFs. Few groups have developed nanoparticulate delivery systems functionalized with anti-FAP antibodies (either entire or fragments) to promote CAF specific delivery of cytotoxic agents, molecular inhibitors, or contrast agents. In this study, we coupled the FAP-targeting specificity with the selective activity of Nav, an experimental drug with increased efficacy in CAFs and myofibroblast rather than in cancer cells. In particular, in TNBC, Nav shows very limited efficacy due to innate drug resistance. Our results show that by functionalizing HFn with FAP antibody fragments, we were able to significantly increase CAF tropism of the nanocages and, at the same time, reduce their off-target distribution to tumor cells, most likely by competing with the natural TfR1 binding site exploited by HFn to interact with cells. This result is very promising for developing new targeted therapies. We decided to investigate the targeting and cytotoxic properties of engineered nanodrugs in cells of both mouse and human origin for different reasons. The first one is gaining important information for the set-up of a reliable preclinical model, in which we are going to test the efficacy of our nanodrugs. Thanks to the strong targeting observed in CAFs and the concomitant reduced uptake in 4T1 cells, we are confident that our anti-FAP functionalized nanodrugs could be reliable agents for delivering cytotoxic drugs specifically into CAFs also in vivo. The second reason is giving a stronger translational direction to our results. Our data showing that HFn-FAP is able to selectively target human activated myofibroblasts further supports the idea that our nanodrug could be applied not only to CAFs in TNBC, but also to other malignancies where stromal FAP is overexpressed. Finally, our results confirm that the higher efficacy of functionalized nanocages in FAP+ cells was correlated with a higher intracellular uptake of such particles. Our in vivo data suggest that the biodistribution profile observed for HFn-FAP was similar to what we previously observed with non-functionalized HFn. Here, the intratumoral signal remained highly stable up to 4 h upon administration, while the elimination profile from off target organs was much more rapid as compared to the one in the tumor. This, together with the immunofluorescence studies proving HFn-FAP targeting of CAFs in vivo, suggest that the functionalization with FAP is able to trigger a specific CAF recognition in the tumor that, at the same time, might also enhance intratumoral retention of the particles.Results from our study also document effective nanoformulation of Nav drug. Encapsulated Nav is released inside the cells and maintains its native pro-apoptotic activity in sensitive cells, as verified by apoptosis induction, BAX activation, and PARP-1 cleavage. This was not taken for granted, as after coupling with copper sulfate, the properties of the drug might have changed. Considering the intrinsic difficulties in loading such hydrophobic drugs, this method allowed us to load enough drug to have a strong specific activity on target cells, without disassembling the structure of HFn and ensuring more robust stability to the drug. Further studies are needed to validate our hypothesis that HNav-FAP can be employed to eradicate CAFs in combination with tumor cells-targeted therapies. Finally, it will be interesting to verify if Nav encapsulation effectively reduces its strong known side effects, in particular thrombocytopenia. We are confident that, thanks to the high intrinsic biocompatibility and favorable pharmacokinetics of HFn, and most importantly to tumor tropism of HFn nanocages both in vitro and in vivo, Nav release in the blood will be unlikely, thus reducing contact time with platelets and related side effects. In conclusion, our results give us confidence that the use of HNav-FAP in combination with a chemotherapeutic, would allow us to develop a double strategy with selective efficacy on CAFs and tumor cells, thus maximizing therapeutic potential and reducing side effects. Moreover, as the 4T1 preclinical model normally leads to the formation of metastases, it would be extremely interesting to study whether the CAF-targeting nano-strategy could reduce the formation of metastases.Publisher\u2019s Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.Supplementary MaterialsThe following are available online at , Figure S1: representative images of healthy and apoptotic nuclei upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S2: flow cytometry analysis of CAFs isolation from 4T1 tumor, Figure S3: characterization of the cellular models used in the study, Figure S4: Proof of Fab@FAP conjugation to HFn nanocage, Figure S5: Confocal microscopy of HFn-FAP internalized in HMfs, Figure S6: immunoblotting of PARP-1 cleavage upon Nav and HNav treatment, Figure S7: Cytotoxicity of functionalized HFn-FAP and non-functionalized HFn nanocages, Figure S8: Cytotoxicity of CuSO4 and HFn in MDA.MB.231 cells, Figure S9: Biodistribution of HFn-FAP in a murine model of TNBC, Figure S10: Ex vivo imaging of off target organs upon injection of HFn-FAP.Author ContributionsM.T. and F.C. conceived and designed the study; L.S.

A growing body of evidence indicates a crucial role of leptin in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Particularly, it has been extensively demonstrated that this adipokine is an important pro-inflammatory, proangiogenic, pro-invasive and mitogenic factor, whose actions are strengthened through interaction with other different signaling molecules such as estrogens, growth factors and inflammatory cytokines.Leptin may act via endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine manner in breast cancer. Indeed, in addition to the adipose tissue that represents the main source of leptin, normal and malignant breast tissue also secrete this adipokine. Leptin and its receptor (ObR) are overexpressed in breast cancer compared with non-transformed mammary gland and benign mammary tumors and both molecules positively correlated with poor prognosis in primary breast carcinoma. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that leptin is also secreted by a subpopulation of fibroblasts, known as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), within the tumor microenvironment, and that CAFs-secreted leptin promotes proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of breast cancer cells.Since Paget\u2019s \u201cSeed and Soil\u201d hypothesis on distribution of secondary growths in breast cancer, it took more than 100 years to definitively demonstrate that the phenotype of malignant cells is strictly dependent on heterotypic signals coming from stromal cells in the surrounding microenvironment. Indeed, stromal cells influence tumor invasiveness and malignancy, whereas at the onset and during breast cancer progression, the microenvironment is reorganized by cancer cells. In the almost all solid tumor microenvironment, CAFs are present in aberrantly high numbers and are distinct from normal fibroblasts, involved in the healthy tissue homeostasis. Particularly, in breast malignancies, CAFs exert a pivotal role in tumor onset and progression through multiple mechanisms, such as affecting estradiol levels, secreting increasing levels of growth factors, chemokines, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inducing epigenetic changes, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness. More importantly, CAFs not only induce mammary carcinogenesis but also promote therapeutic resistance, which contributes to breast cancer progression and poor prognosis. Thus, targeting specific CAFs-secreted factors, such as leptin, may provide more effective treatment options to achieve therapeutic benefits in breast cancer patients.The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is an adopted member of the metabolic nuclear receptor superfamily, mainly expressed in the liver and in the gastrointestinal tract, where it regulates expression of genes involved in bile acids, cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. Recent findings extend its function in several nonenterohepatic tissues, including its control in regulating cell growth and carcinogenesis. Indeed, separate studies have established both positive and negative correlations between FXR expression and cancer. Particularly, in breast cancer cell lines FXR agonists inhibit aromatase expression reducing local estrogens production and induce apoptosis, whereas other authors have reported that FXR activation stimulates breast cancer cell proliferation. Besides, we have shown that activated FXR decreases tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell growth reducing the membrane tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 expression and signaling. It has also been demonstrated that FXR activation by natural and synthetic ligands represses the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Thus, FXR can be considered more than a metabolic regulator, and FXR ligands may represent an important research issue to provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.In this study, we investigated, using both in vitro and in vivo experimental models, the ability of the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064 to interfere with cancer-promoting activities of CAFs focusing on the possible opposing role of activated FXR on leptin-induced breast tumor growth and progression.ResultsActivated FXR Inhibits Leptin-Induced Growth and Motility in Breast Cancer CellsLeptin, acting in an autocrine, endocrine and paracrine manner, influences many aspects of breast tumorigenesis from initiation and primary tumor growth to metastatic progression. Thus, our first aim was to investigate the role of activated FXR on leptin-induced cell proliferation and motility using as experimental models poorly invasive/low metastasizing MCF-7 estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 positive and highly invasive and metastatic MDA-MB-231 (ER\u03b1-negative) human breast cancer cells. Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with leptin (500\u2009ng/ml) with or without GW4064 (6\u03bcM), a synthetic FXR agonist, and growth was evaluated by anchorage-independent soft agar assays which closely mimic some in vivo biologic features of tumors. Leptin exposure increased colony numbers in both cell lines and this effect was completely reversed by GW4064 treatment (Fig. 1a). We then examined the ability of the FXR ligand to affect leptin-induced breast cancer cell movement in wound-healing scratch assays. Leptin-treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells moved the farthest in either direction to close the gap compared to untreated cells, whereas GW4064 treatment was able to significantly inhibit leptin-induced migration (Fig. 1b). Moreover, we also tested the effect of GW4064 in counteracting leptin-induced capacity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells to invade an artificial basement membrane Matrigel in invasion assays. As showed in Fig. 1c, leptin-increased invasion of breast cancer cells was completely abrogated by GW4064 treatment. The ability of the FXR ligand to block leptin actions was also reproduced in another ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cell line, SKBR3 (Supplementary Fig. S1a and S1b online). These results clearly show that FXR activation affects leptin stimulatory effects on growth, motility and invasiveness in different breast cancer cell models.GW4064 Reduces Leptin Signaling Pathway Activation and Leptin Target Gene Expression in Breast Cancer CellsLeptin exerts its biologic function through binding to its specific membrane receptor (ObR) able to activate multiple downstream signaling pathways. First, we evaluated whether GW4064 treatment may affect the expression of leptin receptor (ObR) in breast cancer cells. As reported in Supplementary Fig. S2 online, we did not observe any significant changes in ObR mRNA levels after treatment with GW4064 for 12 and 24\u2009h. Then, immunoblot analysis was performed to evaluate the phosphorylation levels of the major leptin downstream signaling molecules in cells pretreated or not with GW4064 for 12\u2009h and then subjected to short-term stimulation with leptin. As expected, in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, leptin treatment resulted in increased phosphorylation levels of JAK2, STAT3, AKT and MAPK compared to untreated cells, whereas pretreatment with GW4064 abrogated the leptin activation of these signaling pathways (Fig. 2a). Next, we evaluated the impact of activated FXR on the expression of well-known leptin target genes, such as Ob, Cyclin D1 and Survivin. We observed that exposure to GW4064 significantly reduced leptin induction on ObR mRNA levels (Fig. 2b) as well as leptin-mediated upregulation of Cyclin D1 and Survivin protein content (Fig. 2c) in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. These effects were completely reversed in cells transiently transfected with a dominant negative FXR (FXR-DN) plasmid, supporting the direct involvement of this nuclear receptor in affecting leptin signaling in breast cancer cells (Fig. 2d). The negative regulatory role exerted by GW4064 on leptin-target genes was also reproduced in SKBR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1c and S1d online).The suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), the negative feedback regulator of leptin receptor signaling pathway, has been recently identified as a direct FXR target gene. Thus, to gain insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory role of activated FXR on leptin transductional pathways, we conducted time-course studies to examine the effects of the FXR ligand on the expression of SOCS3 in MCF-7 cells. Treatment with GW4064 was able to increase the cellular content of SOCS3 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3a,b). The direct involvement of activated FXR in the regulation of SOCS3 expression in breast cancer cells was ascertained by evaluating SOCS3 content in the presence of FXR-DN plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3c, the expression of the FXR-DN completely abrogated the GW4064-induced SOCS3 levels. Finally, the functional relevance of SOCS3 in mediating GW4064 effects was confirmed by knocking-down its expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3d). SOCS3 gene silencing abolished the inhibition exerted by GW4064 on leptin-induced effects on downstream signalling molecules, such as MAPK and Survivin (Fig. 3e). Taken together, these data demonstrate that modulation of SOCS3 expression may represent a mechanism through which FXR activation could affect leptin activity on breast cancer.GW4064 Reverses CAF-Induced Breast Cancer Cell Growth and MotilityRecently, we have identified leptin as one of the most important molecular player that mediates CAF effects in influencing tumor cell behavior. Indeed, we have shown that leptin immunodepletion from CAF-derived conditioned media (CAF-CM) substantially reduced the growth- and migration-promoting activities of CAFs on breast cancer cells. On the basis of these data and since the activated fibroblasts are the principal cellular components in the breast stromal compartment, we investigated the ability of GW4064 to interfere with tumor microenvironment pressure. To this aim, CAFs were isolated from biopsies of four primary breast tumors and were used in co-culture systems. Isolated CAFs typically displayed the basic fibroblast characteristics with long and spindle-shaped morphology and highly expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) (Supplementary Fig. S3 online). Moreover, ELISA measurement in conditioned media from CAFs confirmed leptin secretion (2, 6\u2009\u00b1\u20090, 21\u2009ng/mg protein). Both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with CAF-CM and growth was evaluated by anchorage-independent soft agar assays. CAF-CM significantly enhanced colony numbers in both cell lines and treatment with GW4064 effectively counteracted the CAF-elicited increase in tumor cell growth (Fig. 4a). Then, we investigated the ability of the FXR ligand to inhibit the effects of conditioned media from CAFs on cell migration and invasion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. As shown in Fig. 4b, CAF-CM significantly accelerated closure of the cell-cleared area in both cell lines compared to control media, and GW4064 treatment was able to reverse these effects. Moreover, CAF-CM stimulation also increased the number of invaded cells in both cell lines and as expected treatment with GW4064 resulted in a clear reduction of cell invasion induced by CAF-CM (Fig. 4c). The inhibitory effects exerted by GW4064 on breast cancer cell proliferation and motility mediated by CAF-CM were also confirmed in SKBR3 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1e and S1f online).The FXR ligand GW4064 Inhibits Tumor Growth in MCF-7/CAF xenograftsBased on our results demonstrating that FXR activation may counteract tumor-promoting ability of CAFs in vitro, we used mouse xenograft models to examine the effect of GW4064 on breast cancer growth in vivo. Hence, MCF-7 cells were injected alone or in combination with CAFs into the intrascapular region of female nude mice and tumor growth was monitored upon the administration of vehicle or 30\u2009mg/kg/die GW4064. This treatment was well tolerated because no change in body weight or in food and water consumption was observed, along with no evidence of reduced motor function. In addition, no significant differences in the mean weights or histological features of the major organs (liver, lung, spleen, and kidney) after sacrifice were observed between vehicle-treated mice and those that received treatment, indicating a lack of toxic effects at the dose given. Tumor volume was measured from the first day of treatment and the relative tumor volume was calculated as described in detail in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 5a, the co-injection of MCF-7 cells with CAFs determined an impressive acceleration in tumor growth when compared to MCF-7 alone. Importantly, GW4064 treatment induced a significant regression in tumor growth in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/CAF groups. To differentiate epithelial and connective components, MCF-7/CAF samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Azan trichrome stain (Fig. 5b,c, respectively). The same sections were also incubated with anti-human-\u03b1SMA and anti-human-Cytokeratin 18 antibodies to verify the human origin of epithelial and connective analyzed tissues (Fig. 5d). Immunostaining of FXR in sections of tumors obtained from GW4064-treated mice revealed an increased immunoreactivity of this receptor, respect to mice treated with vehicle, consistently with the FXR activation by its own ligand (Fig. 6a and Table 1). Moreover, in agreement with our in vitro findings, we observed in xenograft tumors from mice treated with GW4064 a significant reduction in the expression of Ki67, a well-known marker for cell proliferation (Fig. 6a and Table 1). Interestingly, in GW4064-treated tumors we showed a strong intensity staining for SOCS3 along with a marked decrease in the expression of Survivin, Cyclin D1, and Ob (Fig. 6a and Table 1). The up-regulation of FXR and SOCS3 was further validated by RT-PCR analysis on tumor tissue samples (Fig. 6b). Moreover, we revealed no significant changes in Ob mRNA levels among vehicle- and GW4064-treated samples (Fig. 6b), suggesting that a different regulation on Ob mRNA and protein levels may occur after GW4064 treatment.DiscussionThe stromal cells located within the tumor microenvironment are now extensively recognized to directly influence the malignant features of adjacent tumor cells. Interactions between tumor cells and the associated stroma represent a solid relationship that impacts disease initiation, progression and patient prognosis. Emerging evidences have proposed cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) as a pivotal cell type able to shape the architecture of the microenvironment and modulate communications between the various cell types present in the tumor through several signaling molecules, such as growth factors, extracellular matrix-degrading proteases, chemokines and cytokines. Of note, activated stromal fibroblasts have been shown to promote carcinogenesis both in vitro and in animal models and an high number of CAFs are often associated with high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis. Therefore, a better understanding of the epithelial-stromal interactions has the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for developing more effective anticancer approaches.Here, we evidenced, for the first time, that activated FXR, by interfering with the tumor supportive effects of CAFs, is able to inhibit breast cancer growth, motility and invasion. Particularly, we demonstrated that the specific FXR ligand, GW4064, affects the signaling of the adipokine leptin that we have recently identified as one of the most important molecules involved in the tumor-promoting activity of CAFs in breast cancer cells. Our results showed that GW4064 restrains the leptin-induced growth, motility, and invasiveness in both ER\u03b1-positive and -negative breast cancer cells. The anti-tumor action of the FXR ligand was associated with the inhibition of several leptin-induced pathways, such as JAK2/STAT3, AKT and MAPK. Interestingly, FXR activation impacts two well-known target genes of leptin, involved in cell proliferation, survival and motility as Cyclin D1, an important regulator of the cell cycle progression, and Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. Moreover, the FXR ligand induces a decrease on leptin-mediated up-regulation of its own gene (Ob) expression, highlighting how this nuclear receptor is able to negatively interfere in the short autocrine loop maintained by leptin on Ob gene in breast cancer cells. The above described effects were strictly dependent on FXR activation since they disappear in the presence of the dominant negative FXR plasmid. Mechanistically, we discovered that activated FXR counteracts leptin action on breast cancer cells through its ability to induce the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a prototype molecule of the SOCS family. SOCS proteins are negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway and inhibit cytokine signaling by preventing JAK activity or by promoting protein degradation. SOCS3 has been identified as an inducible suppressor of leptin signaling, and in breast cancer cells, its overexpression has been shown to decrease proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Recently, SOCS3 was recognized as a direct FXR target gene. Indeed, it has been demonstrated, in hepatocytes, that FXR ligands upregulate SOCS3 expression by enhancing its promoter activity. Besides, FXR\u2212/\u2212 knockout mice exhibit reduced basal expression of SOCS3, whereas activation of FXR by GW4064 induces SOCS3 mRNA levels in wild-type but not in FXR\u2212/\u2212 mice. In line with these observations, our study demonstrated a direct involvement of FXR in positively modulating SOCS3 expression as revealed by its increase at both mRNA and protein levels in cells treated with GW4064. Furthermore, data from knock-down experiments highlight the functional relevance of SOCS3 in mediating the inhibitory effects of activated FXR on leptin downstream signaling.During breast carcinogenesis, the epithelial and stromal compartments coevolve not only through cell-cell contact but also by secretion of soluble effectors coming from surrounding stromal cells. Indeed, in breast cancer tissues, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) exhibits, in the stroma compartment, changes in the gene expression in a greater extent respect to the invasive tumors. Since the basement membrane is largely intact in DCIS, this suggests that paracrine and endocrine effects are crucial in inducing these modifications. It is now well accepted that the tumor along with its surrounding stromal tissue promotes a leptin-rich environment which contributes to tumor development and progression. In this context, we demonstrated that CAFs, the principal cellular component of the stroma, express leptin receptor and secrete leptin, which sustains a short autocrine loop and is able to target tumor epithelial cells enhancing breast cancer cell growth and invasiveness. Our results show that activated FXR may be able to counteract the leptin-dependent paracrine effects on breast cancer restraining the tumor-promoting activities exerted by CAFs.The physiological relevance of the inhibitory effects exerted by FXR ligand on breast tumor cells is pointed out by our in vivo studies showing that GW4064 administration markedly reduced growth of both MCF-7 as well as MCF-7/CAF xenografts. These observations well correlated with previous reports from our research group demonstrating that FXR activation plays a crucial role in reducing breast cancer cell proliferation and in inhibiting testicular tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Of note, we observed in tumor sections from GW4064-treated mice a significant decrease in the expression of leptin-regulated proteins and this was concomitant with a strong positivity for SOCS3, suggesting that an inhibition of leptin signaling may be involved in the reduction of tumor growth in vivo induced by activated FXR on both MCF-7 alone and MCF-7 co-injected with CAFs.Although the therapeutic strategies against breast cancer have been focused for long time on directly targeting the malignant cell itself, it is now well recognized that the specific control of the signaling coming from the surrounding stromal cells represents an even more compelling treatment option. Thus, our results, highlighting the ability of activated FXR to counteract leptin signaling responsible for mammary carcinogenesis within the tumor microenvironment, support the possibility that FXR ligands could represent a promising pharmacological tools to be exploited in the novel strategies for breast cancer treatment.Materials and MethodsReagents and antibodiesGW4064 from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK).

Before each experiment, cells were grown in phenol red-free medium, containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS (cs-FBS) for 2 days and treated as described.CAF isolationHuman breast cancer specimens were collected in 2013\u20132014 from four primary tumors of patients who signed informed consent in accordance with approved Human Subject\u2019s guidelines at Annunziata Hospital (Cosenza, Italy). Following tumor excision, small pieces were digested (500 IU collagenase in Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution; Sigma; 37\u2009\u00b0C for 2\u2009h). After differential centrifugation (90\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 2\u2009min), the supernatant containing CAFs was centrifuged (500\u2009\u00d7\u2009g for 8\u2009min), resuspended, and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS and antibiotics. CAFs between 4 and 10 passages were used, tested by mycoplasma presence (MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Assay, Lonza), and authenticated by \u03b1SMA and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression. Study was approved by ethics institutional committees at Annunziata Hospital. Experimental procedures for CAF isolation were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.Leptin measurement by ELISALeptin was measured by ELISA (LDN, Nordhorn, Germany) following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Results are presented as nanograms per mg of protein.ImmunofluorescenceCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with anti-human-\u03b1SMA antibody and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. IgG primary antibody was used as negative control. 4\u2032,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) staining was used for nuclei detection. Fluorescence was photographed with OLYMPUS BX51 microscope, 20x objective.Conditioned medium systemsCAFs were incubated with 5% cs-FBS- phenol-red free media (48\u201372\u2009h). Conditioned media (CAF-CM) were collected, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and used in respective experiments.Soft agar growth assaysCells (25,000 per well) were plated in 4\u2009ml of 0.35% agarose with 5% CS-FBS in phenol red-free media, in a 0.7% agarose base in six-well plates. Two days after plating, media containing control vehicle or treatments was added to the top layer, and the media were replaced every two days. After 14 days, 150\u2009\u03bcl of MTT was added to each well and allowed to incubate at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 4\u2009h. Plates were then placed in 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight and colonies >50\u2009\u03bcm diameter from triplicate assays were counted.Wound-healing assaysCell monolayers were scraped and treated as indicated. Wound closure was monitored over 12\u201324\u2009h; cells were fixed and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Pictures were taken at 10X magnification using phase-contrast microscopy and are representative of three independent experiments. The rate of wound healing was quantified from the images using Scion Image Program and Adobe Photoshop Program and standard deviations along with associated P values for the biological replicates were determined by using GraphPad-Prism4 software (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA).Invasion assaysMatrigel-based invasion assay was conducted in invasion chambers (8-\u03bcm membranes) coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 0.4\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Cells treated with leptin, CAF-CM with or without GW4064 were seeded into top Transwell chambers, whereas regular full medium was used as chemoattractant in lower chambers. After 24\u2009h (MDA-MB-231) and 36\u2009h (MCF-7), invaded cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with DAPI. Images represent 1 of 3 independent experiments (10X magnification).Immunoblot analysisMCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells were grown to 50\u201360% confluence and treated as indicated before lysis in 500\u2009\u03bcl of 50\u2009mM Tris-HCl, 150\u2009mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2\u2009mM sodium fluoride, 2\u2009mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sodium orthovanadate) for total protein extraction. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with specific antibodies as described. To ensure equal loading, all membranes were stripped and incubated with anti-\u03b2-Actin antibody. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by incubation of the membranes with peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies and revealed using the ECL System. Blots are representative of three independent experiments. The bands of interest were quantified by Scion Image laser densitometry scanning program and standard deviations along with associated P values for the biological replicates were determined by using GraphPad-Prism4 software.Reverse transcription\u2013PCR assaysTotal RNA was extracted from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3 and CAF cells and from xenografts tissues using TRIzol reagent and the evaluation of FXR, SOCS3, Ob, ObR, FAP and 36B4 gene expression was performed by the reverse transcription-PCR method using a RETROscript kit. The cDNAs obtained were amplified by PCR using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1 online. Negative control contained water instead of first strand cDNA.Transient transfection assaysMCF-7 cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent with either empty vector (e.v.) or FXR-DN plasmid for 24\u2009h and then cells were treated as described. The FXR-DN expression plasmids were provided from Dr T.A. Kocarek (Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Wayne State University, USA).RNA silencingMCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a siRNA targeted for the human SOCS3 RNA sequence (Qiagen, S103060358), or with a control siRNA (Qiagen, S100300650) to a final concentration of 30\u2009nM using Lipofectamine 2000\u2009as recommended by the manufacturer. After 24\u2009h of transfection, cells were exposed to treatments.In vivo experimentsThe in vivo experiments were done in 45-day-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories, Udine, Italy) maintained in a sterile environment. The animals were fully anesthetized by i.p. injection of chloral hydrate 400\u2009mg/kg to allow the s.c. implantation of estradiol (E2) pellets (1.7\u2009mg per pellet, 60-day release; Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) into the intrascapular region. The day after, exponentially growing MCF-7 cells (5.0\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cells per mouse) alone or in combination with CAFs were inoculated s.c. in 0.1\u2009mL of Matrigel. In the group receiving both tumor cells and CAFs, a ratio 3:1 (tumor cells/CAFs) was used. The subcutaneous location was used to eliminate the influence of other mammary gland cellular components on the interaction of human breast fibroblasts and epithelial cells. GW4064 treatment (30\u2009mg/kg/day) was started when mean tumor size reaches to 100\u2009mm3 (day 0) and delivered daily to the animals by i.p. injection. Tumor development was followed twice a week by calliper measurements along two orthogonal axes: length (L) and width (W). The volume (V) of tumors was estimated by the following formula: V\u2009=\u2009L X (W2)/2. Relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated from the following formula: RTV\u2009=\u2009(Vx/V1), where Vx is the tumor volume on day X and V1 is the tumor volume at initiation of the treatment. Growth curve was obtained by plotting the mean volume of RTV on Y axis against time (X axis expressed as days after starting of treatment). At day 32 the animals were sacrificed following the standard protocols and tumors were dissected from the neighboring connective tissue. Specimens of tumors were frozen in nitrogen and stored at \u221280\u2009\u00b0C. The remaining tumor tissues of each sample were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for the histological analyses. All animals were maintained and handled in accordance with the recommendation of the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of University of Calabria, Italy.Histopathological analysisTumors, livers, lungs, spleens and kidneys were fixed in 4% formalin, sectioned at 5\u2009\u03bcm and stained with haematoxylin and eosin Y, as suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy). Some sections from MCF-7/CAFs tumors were stained with Azan trichrome (Bio-Optica, Milan, Italy) to differentiate epithelial and connective components.Immunohistochemical analysisParaffin-embedded sections, 5\u2009\u03bcm thick, were mounted on slides precoated with poly-lysine, and then they were deparaffinised and dehydrated (seven to eight serial sections). Immunohistochemical experiments were performed after heat-mediated antigen retrieval, using human Cytocheratin 18, \u03b1SMA primary antibodies in MCF-7/CAF samples and FXR, Ki67, SOCS3, Ob, Survivin and Cyclin D1 primary antibodies in both MCF-7 and MCF-7/CAF samples at 4\u2009\u00b0C overnight. Then, a biotinylated specific IgG was applied for 1\u2009h at room temperature, followed by the avidin biotin horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, CA). Immunoreactivity was visualized by using the diaminobenzidine chromogen (Sigma-Aldrich). Counterstaining was carried out with haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). The primary antibody was replaced by normal serum in negative control sections. The immunostained slides of tumour samples were evaluated by light microscopy using the Allred Score, which combines a proportion score and an intensity score. A proportion score was assigned representing the estimated proportion of positively stained tumor cells (0\u2009=\u2009none; 1\u2009=\u20091/100; 2\u2009=\u20091/100 to\u2009<\u20091/10; 3\u2009=\u20091/10 to <1/3; 4\u2009=\u20091/3 to 2/3; 5\u2009=\u2009>\u20092/3). An intensity score was assigned by the average estimated intensity of staining in positive cells (0\u2009=\u2009none; 1\u2009=\u2009weak; 2\u2009=\u2009moderate; 3\u2009=\u2009strong). Proportion score and intensity score were added to obtain a total score that ranged from 0 to 8. A minimum of 100 cells were evaluated in each slide. Six to seven serial sections were scored in a blinded manner for each sample.Statistical analysesEach datum point represents the mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009S.D. of three different experiments. Data were analyzed by Student\u2019s t test using the GraphPad Prism 4 software program. For immunohistochemistry, the differences in the scores between GW-treated and vehicle-treated samples were examined by one-way ANOVA. *P\u2009<\u20090.05 was considered as statistically significant.Additional InformationHow to cite this article: Giordano, C. et al.

        "content": "The tumour stroma regulates nearly all stages of carcinogenesis. Stromal heterogeneity in human triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) remains poorly understood, limiting the development of stromal-targeted therapies. Single-cell RNA sequencing of five TNBCs revealed two cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) and two perivascular-like (PVL) subpopulations. CAFs clustered into two states: the first with features of myofibroblasts and the second characterised by high expression of growth factors and immunomodulatory molecules. PVL cells clustered into two states consistent with a differentiated and immature phenotype. We showed that these stromal states have distinct morphologies, spatial relationships and functional properties in regulating the extracellular matrix. Using cell signalling predictions, we provide evidence that stromal-immune crosstalk acts via a diverse array of immunoregulatory molecules. Importantly, the investigation of gene signatures from inflammatory-CAFs and differentiated-PVL cells in independent TNBC patient cohorts revealed strong associations with cytotoxic T-cell dysfunction and exclusion, respectively. Such insights present promising candidates to further investigate for new therapeutic strategies in the treatment of TNBCs.",

However, the antimetastatic capacity of furanodiene in combination with the common chemotherapy drug doxorubicin has not been investigated. We found that doxorubicin at a non-toxic concentration induced cell migration and cell invasion in highly metastatic breast cancer cells. Combinational treatments with furanodiene and doxorubicin blocked the invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in\u00a0vitro. We also clarified the effects of the combination on the signaling pathways involved in migration, invasion, and cytoskeletal organization.

Moreover, combinational treatments also resulted in a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).

Clinically, the therapeutic regimen for TNBC treatment is quite limited due to its lack of response to hormonal therapies and HER-2 targeting therapies. Consequently, chemotherapy remains the mainstay. Docetaxel (DTX) is a representative first-line drug for TNBC treatment, with many synergetic chemotherapy regimens studied for the heterogeneity of TNBC. Ginsenoside Rg3, the main active ingredient derived from Radix Ginseng, was approved as a commercial anti-cancer drug (Shenyi capsules) in 2004 in China and has been synergistically utilized with chemotherapy in the clinical treatment of breast cancers. It was reported that Rg3 can improve the susceptibility of tumor cells to taxanes by inhibiting NF-\u03baB signaling. Therefore, Rg3 is expected to enhance the cytotoxic effect of DTX as an adjuvant agent. However, it is difficult to realize the synergistic effect of DTX and Rg3 for the low bioavailability of Rg3 and the different in vivo fates between DTX and Rg3. Rg3 is easily degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and blood and cannot reach tumor site with DTX synchronously. In addition, nonionic surfactants are required due to the poor water-solubility of DTX and Rg3, which may induce serious adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral neuropathy.Given these drawbacks, surfactant-free nanocarriers have been well studied and developed as commercial drugs, such as Doxil\u00ae (liposomal formulation of doxorubicin) and Nanoxel-PM (docetaxel-loaded micelle). Among various nanocarriers, liposomes have been regarded as the most promising delivery system for the biocompatibility and the capability for co-delivery of combined drugs with different solubility. Accordingly, approximately twenty liposomal products have passed into clinical use for cancer therapy. However, nanotechnological chemotherapy has shown limited success in clinical translation. Some studies demonstrated that despite the improved safety of free drugs, little benefit of Doxil\u00ae and Nanoxel-PM was observed for the overall survival of treated patients. It is mainly caused by two aspects: (1) inadequate tumor site-specific delivery and (2) tough tumor microenvironment (TME). It is said that liposomes can accumulate more at tumor site compared with free drugs by virtue of their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. However, perception about the potency of EPR effect in humans has been challenged in clinical practice. Vascular leakage in human tumors is not as significant as that in murine models, leading to the overestimation of the efficiency of EPR effect. Therefore, ligand-based active tumor-targeting strategies are steadily gaining attentions. Cancer cells tend to take up glucose at an elevated rate to meet their increased energy demands. The most widely expressed glucose transporter is glucose transporters 1 (Glut1), which is responsible for basal glucose uptake. As a result, Glut1 is overexpressed and confers poor prognosis in a wide range of solid tumors in clinic such as TNBC, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal, brain, renal, lung, cutaneous, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancers. Therefore, Glut1 has been exploited as the clinically validated target for drug delivery in considerable tumor models. Glucose-modified liposomes have been designed to realize the active targeting to tumor cells via the interaction between glucose and Glut1 which is much more highly expressed on tumor cells than normal cells. Although preclinical studies of ligand-modified liposomes for tumor therapy are compelling, none of them have been approved for clinical use. The key challenge is that the surface modification of ligands or antibodies entails sophisticated synthesis and formulation procedures, posing challenges for large-scale production as well as the pharmacokinetics and toxicology evaluation. That is the reason why most of the clinically approved nano-medicines have quite simplistic compositions. Therefore, a simple yet smart liposome is crucial in achieving the idea of \u201cbench to bedside\u201d.Even if tumor targeting can be achieved, the efficacy of nanomedicines will still be limited by TME. Studies on anti-tumor strategies have been always centered on neutralizing tumor cells. However, the immunosuppressive TME and the physical penetration barrier created by the stromal cells, to a large extent, lead to poor responses to liposomal chemotherapy. TNBC is a typical stroma-rich tumor and is the most representative \u201ccold\u201d tumor with insufficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most predominant group among the interstitial cells and are critical modulators for the formation of dense extracellular matrix (ECM) and immunosuppressive TME. Researches on the depletion of CAFs are emerging to facilitate drug permeation and response and the sequential two-stage therapy was thereby applied, i.e., the first stage for CAFs exhaustion and the second stage for tumor cell neutralization. Although this strategy can theoretically improve the therapeutic effect, it tends to involve the ligands modification for tumor cells and CAFs targeting, and encapsulation of anti-cancer and anti-fibrotic agents, respectively. As mentioned above, no active tumor targeting liposomes have been approved in clinic for overcomplication, let alone the sequential therapy of two types of ligand-modified liposomes. Such two-step sequential dosing also makes it more difficult to develop clinical treatment regimens. Moreover, exhausting CAFs may abrogate crucial ECM components and promote tumor metastasis. Thus, it may be more feasible to inhibit the conversion and activation of CAFs instead of depleting them. Many studies have elucidated that smart tumor cells can promote the stroma-rich and immune-cold TME by secreting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) to educate CAFs formation and infiltration. Therefore, we speculated that suppressing TGF-\u03b2 secretion from tumor cells to inactivate CAFs might reshape TME, enhance intratumor drug penetration, and achieve better therapeutic outcomes.Surprisingly, in addition to improving the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs, Rg3 also possesses the anti-fibrotic and immunoregulatory capacities. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of blocking the tumor cells from TGF-\u03b2 secretion, indicating its potential to hinder the induction role of tumor cells on CAFs precursors. Therefore, liposomes encapsulated with ginsenoside Rg3 and DTX can simultaneously realize TME remodeling and tumor cell neutralization by directly targeting tumor cells. The strategy can circumvent the hassle of the excessive complications associated with CAFs targeting requirements. Moreover, preliminary results from our laboratory showed that ginsenosides can act as a liposome membrane material instead of cholesterol, and, interestingly, ginsenoside liposomes also showed excellent tumor targeting properties. Rg3 is an amphipathic material with hydrophilic glycosyl groups and a lipophilic steroidal structure similar to that of cholesterol (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As a cholesterol analogue, it has the potential as a liposomal membrane stabilizer. Simultaneously, its glycosyls in hydrophilic part can theoretically stick out of the liposome surface, making it a perfect substrate for Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Consequently, Rg3 can act as a liposomal membrane stabilizer, an adjuvant agent and an active tumor targeting ligand without additional chemical modifications.Inspired by this deduction, a DTX-loaded Rg3 liposome (Rg3-Lp/DTX) was developed. In our hypothesis, Rg3 would prevent the formation and activation of CAFs by inhibiting the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 from tumor cells and inhibiting the subsequent CAFs-induced physical and immune barriers in TME. As a result, Rg3-Lp/DTX would concentrate more and penetrate deeper into tumor to better exert synergistic cytotoxic effects. The strategy can eliminate the trouble of designing CAFs targeting nanocarriers, as well as the sequential two-stage administration. It can achieve tumor targeting, CAFs education, TME remodeling and enhanced cytotoxicity on tumor cells merely by replacing cholesterol with Rg3 without resorting to any complicated modifications and formulation processes. Therefore, the system has great clinical translation perspectives and can bridge the gap between laboratory trials and practical clinical applications.ResultsCharacterizations of Rg3-Lp/DTXSchematic illustrations of the preparation of Rg3-Lp/DTX and its mechanism on TNBC inhibition. A Preparation process of Rg3-Lp/DTX. B The multiple functions of Rg3 as a tumor targeting material and crosstalk inhibitor between CAFs and tumor cells. Rg3-Lp/DTX can actively target to tumor cells through Glut1-Rg3 interaction. After uptake by tumor cells, Rg3 can prevent tumor cells from secreting TGF\u03b2, a tumor-secreted cytokine that educates the activation of CAFs. With the diminishment of activated CAFs, Rg3-Lp/DTX can penetrate deeper into tumor tissue to exert combined cytotoxic effect of DTX and Rg3 and convert the TEM from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d.

DTX-loading efficiencies (LE) of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX were 7.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1% and 6.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1%, respectively (Table 1). The mean particle sizes of Rg3-Lp/DTX and C-Lp/DTX measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 96.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.5\u00a0nm and 136.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u00a0nm, respectively (Fig.\u00a01A, Table 1). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that both types of liposomes were spherical (Fig.\u00a01B), indicating the successful construction of Rg3 liposomes. To locate Rg3 in the liposome membrane, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-Rg3 system of Rg3-Lp were conducted. The molecular arrangement of the stable Rg3-DSPC system obtained from MD simulation was shown in Fig.\u00a01C. Rg3 was found to stably interact with the phospholipid molecules and interpenetrate in the lipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01C). From the typical conformation and interaction diagram of phospholipid molecules and Rg3 in Fig.\u00a01C, it can be seen that the planar ring structure of Rg3 and the aliphatic chain at C17 can be embedded between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, thus regulating the arrangement of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer. Simultaneously, the two glycosyl groups of Rg3 at C3 site, which are divided into endo-glycosyl (the first glycosyl unit conjugated to the skeleton, Glu-1) and exo-glycosyl (the second glucose unit, Glu-2), formed H-bond interactions with the polar heads of the phospholipid molecules and improve the stability of lipid membrane. To further reveal the precise position of the glycosyls of Rg3 in the bilayer, the density distribution of phosphorus atoms (P) in the polar head of phospholipid molecules, the oxygen atoms (O) connecting the planar ring and the glycosyl group of Rg3 and the Glu-1 and Glu-2 of Rg3 were analyzed. A symmetrical distribution of the headgroups of Rg3 and DSPC was exhibited in the density profiles along the bilayer\u2019s center in Fig.\u00a01D. The phosphorus atoms in the hydrophilic head of phosphorylcholine represented water\u2013oil boundary between the hydrophobic and the aqueous regions. The peak areas of Glu-1 and Glu-2 were broader than that of P. It suggested that some conformations of Rg3\u2019s glycosyl moiety at C3-position went beyond the scope of DSPC and directly inserted into the water molecular layer (Fig.\u00a01D). The phenomenon was also visually displayed in Fig.\u00a01C, in which numbers of glycosyl units were exposed on the liposome membrane surface and penetrated deeply into the water phase, making it possible to actively interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.As proved in Fig.\u00a01C, D, Rg3 can spontaneously form a stable bilayer membrane structure with phospholipid molecules, indicating the potential of Rg3 as a liposome bilayer regulator. Therefore, to investigate the effect of Rg3 on the properties of lipid bilayer, membrane fluidity (Fig.\u00a01E) and micro-polarity (Fig.\u00a01F) of Rg3-Lp were investigated. The variation of membrane fluidity is related to the C17 side chain and plane ring structure of the regulators embedded between the tail of phospholipid, while the change of membrane micro-polarity is associated with the hydrogen bond interaction between the hydroxyl at C3 site of the regulator and the polar head of phospholipid. As shown in Fig.\u00a01E, the anisotropy of the membrane in Rg3-Lp was much smaller than that in pure phospholipid liposomes (Lp), and similar to that in C-Lp. The results indicated that Rg3 could increase the liposomal membrane fluidity similar to cholesterol. Due to the insertion of Rg3 or cholesterol molecules with the planar ring structure between phosphorylcholine molecules, the dispersion force between the fatty acids tails of phosphorylcholine molecules will be disrupted. As a result, the lipid bilayer would be more fluid. Therefore, the membrane fluidity increased after the incorporation of Rg3 or cholesterol into the phospholipid bilayer (Fig.\u00a01E). According to MD results, the side chain at C17 site and planar ring structure of Rg3 were interspersed between the fatty acid tails of phospholipids, which was mainly responsible for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Therefore, Rg3 showed a comparable effect on the fluidity of lipid membrane with that of C-Lp because of the similarity of them in the side chain and planar ring structures (Fig.\u00a01E). In addition, to verify the interaction of the glycosyl units at C3 site of Rg3 with phospholipid molecules, micro-polarity of liposomes was measured (Fig.\u00a01E). Pyrene is usually applied to measure the modulation of bilayer micro-polarity induced by Rg3. The fluorescence intensity ratio of pyrene I1/I3 can reflect the polarity of the environment, which is related to the arrangement of acyl groups.32 A decrease in I1/I3 value implies a higher binding affinity between the membrane regulator and the phospholipid molecules, resulting in lower micro-polarity between the lipid bilayers. The tight connection is favorable for improving the membrane stability and encapsulation efficiency of hydrophobic drugs. The ratio of I1/I3 in Lp solution was 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05, while that in Rg3-Lp and C-Lp solution was 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 0.94\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02, respectively (Fig.\u00a01F). The results proved that the micro-polarity of Rg3-Lp was significantly lowered after the addition of Rg3, demonstrating that Rg3 formed intensive interactions with the polar head of phospholipids and further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX exhibited less leakage and better particle stability than C-Lp/DTX did during the storage period at 4\u2103 for 7\u00a0days in PBS (Fig.\u00a01G and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). As shown in Fig.\u00a01G, an obvious burst leakage of C-Lp/DTX (18.3%) was observed on day 1 versus the leakage of Rg3-Lp/DTX (1.0%), indicating that DTX leaked more easily from C-Lp/DTX than Rg3-Lp/DTX. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S3, the particle size and PDI of C-Lp/DTX increased significantly on day 4, whereas the size of Rg3-Lp/DTX remained stable, which may be due to the stronger interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl portion with phospholipid molecules.Enhanced cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells via Rg3-Glut1 interactionTumor targeting ability of Rg3-Lp.

F Biodistribution of the DID-labeled liposomes in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice at different time points after intravenous injection. G Ex vivo imaging of dissected tumors 24\u00a0h after injection of C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD, respectively. H Semi-quantitative ROI values of mean fluorescence intensity at tumor sites. **p\u2009<\u20090.01; Data are shown as mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard deviation of three technical replicates; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a01C, D, the glycosyls of Rg3 at the C3-position were oriented towards the water molecules and sticked out of the surface of the liposomal membrane, which could potentially interact with Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells. Therefore, molecular docking was carried out to explore the potential of Rg3 to interact with Glut1, respectively (Fig.\u00a02A, B). It could be found that the glycosyl units of Rg3 was hydrogen-bonded to the surrounding polar residues of Glut1. The interacting residues were: W288, N288, N411, Q161, Q282, Q283, Q283 and Q380. Among these, Q282, Q283, W388, and N411 were crucial combination residues for ligand-Glut1 binding. In addition, Q282 and Q283 were proved as key residues for glucose-Glut1 binding. However, contrary to Rg3, cholesterol failed to be hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 because of the lack of a glycosyl moiety at its C-3 site (Fig.\u00a02B). Therefore, it can be inferred that the glucosyls of Rg3 that exposed on the Rg3-Lp surface can interact with the corresponding amino acid residues in Glut1. At the same time, the cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in TNBC tumor cells was investigated. The 4T1 cell/model was chosen because it robustly recapitulates many features of human TNBC, including the stroma-rich TME and Glut1 overexpression on tumor cells. The cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells was 1.7-fold higher than that of C-Lp and was significantly suppressed by WZB117, a specific Glut1 inhibitor, and glucose, a competitive Glut1 inhibitor (Fig.\u00a02C and Additional file 1: Fig. S5). It suggested that Rg3 can actively target to tumor cells by interacting with Glut1 overexpressed in 4T1 cells.The targeting mechanism was further verified by the cellular uptake assays of Rg3-Lp in 4T1 cells before and after Glut1 knockdown. As shown in Fig.\u00a02D, the uptake of Rg3-Lp in Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cells (4T1Glut\u2212) was significantly abated compared to that in normal 4T1 cells, whereas the uptake of C-Lp remained unchanged in 4T1Glut\u2212 cells and normal 4T1 cells. After treatment with the liposomes, 4T1 cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained for the visualization of Glut1 expression and were subjected to confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) imaging to observe Rg3-Lp\u2014Glut1 binding. As shown in Fig.\u00a02E, the yellow signals represented successful merging of Glut1 (red) signals and C6-loaded liposomes (green) signals. The fluorescence signal of Rg3-Lp was selectively localized at the sites revealing red signals and the merged signal of Rg3-Lp was much higher than that of C-Lp (Fig.\u00a02E). Furthermore, the signal of Rg3-Lp in tumor cells was markedly diminished when the expression of Glut1 decreased (Fig.\u00a02E). The results above synthetically demonstrated that Rg3 can be specifically taken up by tumor cells through the binding interaction between its glycosyl groups exposed on the liposomal surface and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Tumor tropism of Rg3-LpAs proved in Fig.\u00a02A\u2013D, the glycosyls of Rg3 exposed on the liposomal surface could endow Rg3-Lp with the potential for active tumor targeting. The biodistribution of Rg3-Lp in tumor-bearing mice was monitored under in vivo imaging system (IVIS). DiD-loaded Rg3-Lp (Rg3-Lp/DiD) or DiD-loaded C-Lp (C-Lp/DiD) were intravenously injected into 4T1-bearing mice. Biodistribution of the DiD-loaded liposomes in 4T1-bearing mice were detected at different time points under IVIS (Fig.\u00a02F). As shown in Fig.\u00a02F, orthotopic tumor was located at the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of the mice marked with a white circle. The fluorescence signals could be observed at the breast tumor sites four hours after the administration of Rg3-Lp/DiD and showed stronger fluorescence signals from then on, while the signals at the tumor site of mice treated with C-Lp/DiD were hardly detected, indicating that Rg3-Lp accumulated more at tumor site than C-Lp. After 24\u00a0h, mice were sacrificed and the tumors and major organs were excised and imaged ex vivo under IVIS to observe the biodistribution of the liposome ex vivo (Fig.\u00a02G, H and Additional file 1: Fig. S6). The targeting ability of Rg3 liposomes was demonstrated by imaging and semi-quantitative assays of the tumors excised from the mice at the ending point (Fig.\u00a02G, H). The ROI value of the tumor injected with Rg3-Lp/DiD was almost two-fold higher of that from the tumor treated with C-Lp/DiD. It could be concluded that liposomes with Rg3 as membrane material can deliver drugs to tumor site more effectively and selectively than conventional cholesterol liposomes. One of the fundamental differences between malignant cancer cells and normal cells is that cancer cells obtain energy by an increased rate of aerobic glycolysis through the enhanced catabolism of glucose, instead of oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cells must elevate their glycolytic rate to meet the energy they need to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. In order to achieve a glycolytic rate that is approximately 30-fold higher than that of normal cells, cancer cells must take up glucose at an elevated rate. The glycolysis rate strongly depends on the upregulated expression and activity of Glut1, with a 10\u201312-fold higher expression in tumor cells than that in normal cells. As a result, overexpression of Glut1 has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor sites than C-Lp via the interaction between the glucose moiety of Rg3 and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells.Enhanced cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX against tumor cellsIC50 value of DTX and different DTX-loaded carriersGroup\tIC50 value (ng/ml)\t \tDTX\t5.1\t \tC-Lp/DTX\t25.4\t \tNanoxel-PM\t10.9\t \tRg3\tN/A\t \tRg3-Lp\tN/A\t \tRg3/DTX\t2.3\t \tRg3-Lp/DTX\t0.8\t \tIn vitro cytotoxicity effect of Rg3-Lp.

Quantitative (C) and qualitative (D) cell apoptosis of PBS (negative control), DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX on 4T1 cells. (n\u2009=\u20093) Blue signal: Hoechst; Red signal: propidium iodide (PI). ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Differences between two groups were analyzed with unpaired t-test, one-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groupsThe in vitro cytotoxicity of DTX and different DTX-loaded liposomes on 4T1 cells was measured by MTT assays (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). Unlike C-Lp/DTX (IC50\u2009=\u200925.4\u00a0ng/ml) and Nanoxel-PM (IC50\u2009=\u200910.9\u00a0ng/ml), Rg3-Lp/DTX showed the strongest cytotoxicity effect (IC50\u2009=\u20090.8\u00a0ng/ml) (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). To explain this phenomenon, IC50 value between DTX and simple Rg3 and DTX mixture (Rg3/DTX) group were compared and we found that the IC50 value of Rg3/DTX group was half that of DTX group even though the cytotoxic effect of Rg3 or Rg3-Lp were obviously weaker than that of DTX (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It indicated that Rg3 was an adjuvant drug for DTX which can enhance the cytotoxicity of DTX, but showed much lower cytotoxic effect compared to DTX when administered alone. It has been reported that Rg3 is capable of sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, and could enhance the inhibitory effects of docetaxel on cancer cells while its own cytotoxicity was not significant as chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, the IC50 value of Rg3-Lp/DTX group was about 0.35 times that of Rg3/DTX group (Table 2, Fig.\u00a03A). It might be ascribed to the glycosyl chains of ginsenoside Rg3, through which Rg3-Lp can enhance cellular uptake mediated by the specific binding between Glut1 and Rg3 as proved above and accordingly deliver more DTX and Rg3 into tumor cells. Therefore, the strong 4T1 cytotoxic effect of Rg-Lp/DTX was the combined result of its tumor-targeting ability and its synergistic effect with DTX.Cell apoptosis assay was further conducted to verify the cytotoxicity of Rg3-Lp/DTX. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a03B, C, the results of cellular apoptosis experiment were similar to those of MTT assays. Rg3-Lp alone showed significantly weaker pro-apoptosis effect than DTX. However, encapsulation of DTX in Rg3 liposomes can significantly facilitate late apoptosis and enhance total apoptosis rate. The notable enhanced apoptosis effect of Rg3-Lp/DTX was further verified by qualitative observation under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Fig.\u00a03D). The effect mainly relied on the facilitated cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp/DTX and chemo-sensitization effect of Rg3.Inhibition of tumor growth by Rg3-Lp/DTXRg3-Lp/DTX inhibited tumor growth in the 4T1 orthotopic mouse model.

Tumor volume and body weight of each mouse were monitored at the same time of administration and none of the tumor-bearing mice after different treatment dead during the monitoring period. At day 20, tumors of each group were dissected, weighted and photographed (Fig.\u00a04A). As shown in Fig.\u00a04B, the growth of tumors treated with C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM was slightly slower than that of free DTX group. However, after replacing cholesterol with Rg3, the growth of tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX was almost arrested. The results showed that Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly diminished the tumor volume and weight (Fig.\u00a04C, D). In addition, tumor volume and weight of Rg3 group were almost the same as those of PBS group, but the tumor growth was significantly inhibited when Rg3 was prepared into Rg3-Lp (Fig.\u00a04C, D), which is comparable to the effect of C-Lp/DTX group. Since Rg3 itself did not exert cytotoxicity effect as proved above, it suggests that Rg3 may act via other pathways to regulate tumor growth. The results in Fig.\u00a04E indicates that Rg3-Lp/DTX presented significantly improved antitumor activity with no loss of body weight, whereas the body weight decreased slightly after the treatment with free DTX, which may be attributed to its systemic toxicity.Rg3 inhibited the activation of CAFs based on TGF-\u03b2/Smad pathwayTGF-\u03b2/Smad pathway plays an essential role in the conversion of normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells binds to and activates receptors on the precursors of CAFs, resulting in the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Then, complexes between phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad4 are formed and translocated into the nucleus to bind with the associated DNA strands and disrupt their transcription, thereby undermining the activation of fibroblasts (cancer associated fibroblasts, namely CAF) in TME, which typically involves the up-regulation of markers such as \u03b1-SMA. CAFs along with the secreted dense extracellular matrix (ECM) form a stiff physical barrier that inhibits the penetration of liposomes.Inhibition effect of Rg3 on CAFs formation and activation.

As shown in Fig.\u00a05A, the concentration of TGF-\u03b2 in 4T1 cultured medium was significantly decreased after Rg3 treatment. The TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp/DTX group was only half of that in C-Lp/DTX group. NFs are the predominant precursors of CAFs. TGF-\u03b2 secreted form tumor cells can transform the normal paraneoplastic fibroblasts into CAFs gradually during tumor progression. Mouse embryonic fibroblast 3T3 is a representative murine normal fibroblast which is sensitive to the cytokine stimulation. Artificial CAFs are usually made in vitro by activating 3T3 cells using TGF-\u03b2 or CM from tumor cells. Therefore, to simulate education role of tumor cells on normal fibroblasts-to-CAFs transformation, normal fibroblast 3T3 cells was cultured with tumor CM after different treatment. By characterizing phenotypic changes in 3T3 cell line, the effect of Rg3 on the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation can be evaluated. To investigate the phenotypic changes of CAFs precursors to TGF-\u03b2, we measured \u03b1-SMA expression, a representative CAFs marker, of 3T3 cells after different treatments. The level of \u03b1-SMA expression of 3T3 cells was obviously enhanced after stimulation with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) and 4T1-CM, respectively, when compared with that of PBS group (Fig.\u00a05B). Furthermore, with the addition of SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor, the expression of \u03b1-SMA in 3T3 cells was lowered, indicating that TGF-\u03b2 was a dominant factor in 4T1-CM that led to CAFs activation (Fig.\u00a05B). 3T3 cells were then cultured with different 4T1-CM which were harvested from the cultured medium of 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX or Rg3-Lp/DTX. The expression levels of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA were shown in Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9, from which we can found that high level of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA was detected in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 conditioned medium pretreated with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX) and Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), respectively. On the contrary, significantly lowered expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA expression was observed in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1-CM which was extracted from 4T1 cultured medium pretreated with all Rg3 containing group, including Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@ Rg3-Lp/DTX) (Fig.\u00a05C and Additional file 1: Fig. S9). The results demonstrated the outstanding effect of Rg3 on decreasing the expression of p-Smad2/3 and \u03b1-SMA. The tendency was consistent with immunofluorescence (IF) staining results of \u03b1-SMA expression in Fig.\u00a05D. The green signal which represents the \u03b1-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was conspicuous when treated with TGF-\u03b2, 4T1-CM and 4T1-CM@DTX, respectively, while the signal remained quite weak after the treatment with 4T1-CM@Rg3 or additional SB-431542 (Fig.\u00a05D). Therefore, it can be speculated that Rg3 can inhibit the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 secretion of tumor cells and the subsequent TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling of CAFs.To verify the deduction, in vivo analysis of the corresponding indicators was carried out. The level of TGF-\u03b2 in tumor tissues of different groups was measured by ELISA kit and the gene expression of \u03b1-SMA was analyzed by q-PCR assays. As revealed in Fig.\u00a05E, F, the interaction between tumor cells and CAFs led to hyperactivation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, involving a-SMA induction and myofibroblast trans-differentiation. The neoplastic TGF-\u03b2 concentration in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was nearly half of that in C-Lp/DTX group and consequently, the a-SMA gene expression of tumor tissues in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was decreased to one-third of that in C-Lp/DTX group (Fig.\u00a05E, F). Moreover, the protein expression p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA of tumor tissue in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group was obviously lower than that in C-Lp/DTX group, indicating that Rg3 can effectively inhibit the conversion to CAFs via tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion and TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling suppression (Fig.\u00a05G and Additional file 1: Fig. S10). As a result, the abundance of activated CAFs was significantly reduced in tumor tissue by Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX (Fig.\u00a05H). Unlike the in vitro results showing that Rg3 and Rg3-Lp have comparable inhibition efficacy of tumor-CAFs interaction, the level of TGF-\u03b2 concentration and signaling in tumors of Rg3-Lp group was much lower than that in free Rg3 group (Fig.\u00a05E\u2013H) in vivo owing to the enhanced targeting delivery capacity when Rg3 was formulated into liposomes.Enhanced tumor penetration capacity of Rg3-LpEnhanced tumor penetration ability of Rg3-Lp.

Scale bar: 2\u00a0mm. ***p\u2009<\u20090.001; Unpaired t-test was used for analysis of differences between two groups. Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsAn obvious decrease in CAFs abundance in tumors could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX groups compared with that in PBS group and other DTX-loaded nanocarriers, which allowed Rg3-based liposomes to access tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs (Fig.\u00a05G, H). As shown in Fig.\u00a06A, Rg3-Lp could penetrate more deeply into 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroids composed of 4T1 tumor cells and 3T3 cells, and stronger fluorescence intensity and deeper penetration distance could be observed in tumor spheroids treated with Rg3-Lp/C6. Moreover, the depth of penetration of Rg3-Lp and C-Lp in tumor sphere was measured to be 66.7\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm and 113.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.8\u00a0\u03bcm (Fig.\u00a06B), respectively, implying that Rg3 could significantly improve the tumor penetration ability of the liposomes. To analyze the association between the level of CAFs and penetration depth of the liposomes, tumor sections from each group were immunohistochemically stained and fully scanned for the visualization of \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D). The TUNNEL signals in the fully scanned images of tumor slices can reflect the penetration depth in the tumor, since only when the liposomes reach the site can their cytotoxic effect work on the cells. Surprisingly, the sites with positive tunnel signals were found to basically coincide with those with weak \u03b1-SMA signals (Fig.\u00a06C, D), which means that the depth of tumor penetration was negatively correlated with the abundance of activated CAFs. As shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S14, the significant decrease in collagen deposition could be observed in Rg3-Lp and Rg3-Lp/DTX group compared with that in PBS group and other DTX formulations, which allowed the liposomes to reach tumor cells without obstacles raised from CAFs and their secreted ECM. Therefore. as shown in Fig.\u00a06C, D, the tumor slices in Rg3-Lp/DTX group showed the strongest tunnel signal and the widest tunnel signal area, suggesting the excellent tumor penetration ability of the system.Activated tumor immune microenvironment by Rg3-Lp/DTXAnalysis of immune cells in TME. A Flow cytometric and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors treated with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX, respectively.

D Flow cytometry gating and histogram analysis of the relative abundance of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells over total lymphocyte cells (CD45+ cells) in tumors. *P\u2009<\u20090.05, **P\u2009<\u20090.01, and ***P\u2009<\u20090.001; One-way ANOVA was performed to compare data among multiple groups; Error bars represent mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD of three independent experimentsBreast cancer is categorized as a cold tumor, in which effector T cells are either excluded from the tumor area or taken away from being in contact with tumor cells. Apart from acting as a barrier for the penetration of drugs into the tumor area, the dense stroma like CAFs presumably creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including low cytotoxic T cells infiltration, M1 to M2 polarization and enrichment of immunosuppressive cells. Therefore, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were quantified by flow cytometry to examine whether Rg3-Lp/DTX could turn the tumor immunity from cold into hot by attenuating the activation of CAFs. The immunostimulatory effects of Rg3-Lp/DTX were shown in Fig.\u00a07. A notable increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the tumors treated with Rg3-Lp/DTX could be observed, indicating that tumor immunity was getting hotter (Fig.\u00a07A). As depicted in Fig.\u00a07B, the number of M2 tumor-facilitating macrophages was significantly reduced in Rg3-Lp/DTX group. In contrast, the number of M1 tumor-suppressing macrophages was dramatically increased by Rg3-Lp/DTX, which might be attributed to the inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling and CAFs activation induced by Rg3-Lp. It has been reported that CAFs are important inducers for the transformation from M1- to M2- macrophages. As proved in Fig.\u00a05 3T3 cells were activated into CAFs after incubating with 4T1-CM since it contained high levels of TGF-\u03b2 secreted by tumor cells. When treated with CAFs cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM (3T3-CM@4T1-CM), M1-phenotype macrophages were differentiated into M2-phenotype, indicating the induction role of CAFs on M1 to M2 differentiation (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). It has been proved that Rg3 could significantly decrease the level of activated CAFs by inhibiting tumor secretion of TGF-\u03b2 (Fig.\u00a05A\u2013H). As a result, when incubated with 3T3 cultured medium that was collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), the relative abundance of M2 macrophages converted from M1 macrophages was significantly reduced than that in 3T3-CM@4T1-CM group (Additional file 1: Fig. S13). Therefore, Rg3-Lp is potential to inhibit the M1 to M2 shift induced by CAFs and raise the M1/M2 ration in TME via the suppression of tumor-induced CAFs activation. In addition, the number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) was obviously decreased in Rg3-Lp/DTX treated groups (Fig.\u00a07C, D). In summary, Rg3-Lp/DTX created a more immune-active microenvironment compared to routine C-Lp/DTX and Nanoxel-PM with more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, decreased MDSCs and Tregs and increased M1/M2 ratios, mainly due to the targeting delivery of Rg3 and its effect on the inhibition of CAFs, a cold immunity inducer.DiscussionSynergetic chemotherapy regimens have been widely applied in clinic for the high molecular heterogeneity of TNBC Ginsenoside Rg3 has been applied in synergy with chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer therapy to optimize the clinical outcomes of antitumor drugs.5 We found that the cytocidal and pro-apoptotic effect of DTX was significantly improved when administered in combination with Rg3 even though Rg3 showed much lower cytotoxicity to 4T1 cells compared to DTX. The IC50 value of Rg3/DTX was 0.45 times that of DTX and the percentage of late apoptotic cells in Rg3/DTX group was nearly twice that in DTX group. Therefore, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant drug to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.Despite the enhanced tumor cytotoxic effect of the combination of Rg3 and DTX in vitro, the co-administration regimen is far from satisfactory in vivo caused by the low bioavailability of Rg3 and different systemic distribution between Rg3 and DTX. Thus, liposomes have been extensively investigated as effective carriers for co-delivery of combined drugs. Due to the controversy regarding the difference of EPR effect between human and experimental animal models, researchers are increasingly focusing on ligand-modification active targeting to realize tumor site-specific aggregation of the loaded agents. Unfortunately, no active targeting nanocarriers have been approved for clinical use to date for the complex ligand chemical modification process and the excessively laborious formulation process that sacrifices the clinical translational feasibility.In our study, we found that Rg3 could help liposomes achieve tumor active targeting without resorting to any complex preparations. We found that the structure of Rg3 satisfies the requirements of a liposomal membrane regulator to interact with phospholipid molecules and stabilize the liposome bilayer. Therefore, cholesterol was replaced with Rg3 to construct Rg3-Lp/DTX. Rg3-Lp/DTX had the similar morphology and drug loading efficacy to C-Lp/DTX, indicating that Rg3 was successfully utilized as a liposome membrane regulator. MD simulation of Rg3-phospholipids system proved that Rg3 can stably intercalate into the lipid bilayer and form intensive hydrogen bonds with phospholipid molecules through its hydroxyl group at C3 position, thus filling the gaps between phospholipid molecules and regulating the properties of liposomal membranes. To verify the calculation, membrane fluidity and micro-polarity of Lp, C-Lp and Rg3-Lp were measured, respectively. Membrane fluidity can reflect the regulatory role of the C17 side chain and planar ring structure of membrane regulator on the lipid bilayer, whereas membrane micro-polarity can reflect the hydrogen bond interaction between the C3 hydroxyl group of the regulator and phospholipid molecules. Consistent with MD calculation, Rg3-Lp showed a comparable effect to C-Lp in membrane fluidity enhancement since Rg3 and cholesterol are similar in their C17 side chain and planar ring structure. Meanwhile, Rg3-Lp exhibited stronger micro-polarity than Lp and C-Lp because of the intensive hydrogen bonds formed between its glycosyl units and the polar head of phospholipids, which further constituted hydrogen bond networks to stabilize the entire system. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed improved leakage stability compared to that of C-Lp/DTX. In addition, MD simulation results also confirmed that the glycosyl moieties of Rg3 could stick out of the liposome surface, endowing Rg3-Lp with the potential to recognize and interact with Glut1. Molecular docking results showed that Rg3 can intensively hydrogen-bonded to Glut1 via its glycosyl moieties, while cholesterol failed due to the lack of glycosyl units, which implies that Rg3 has great potential as a targeting membrane material for tumor-specific delivery through its surface glycosyl moieties exposed on liposome surface. Cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp on 4T1 cells and the in vivo imaging of Rg3-Lp distribution proved that much more Rg3-Lp was uptake by 4T1 cells than C-Lp, and Rg3-Lp can accumulate more at tumor site than C-Lp. After knocking down of Glut1 gene in 4T1 cells, cellular uptake of Rg3-Lp was reduced to a level comparable to that of C-Lp, suggesting that Rg3-Lp can be preferentially uptake by tumor cells via the interaction between Rg3\u2019s glycosyl units extending outside and Glut1 overexpressed on tumor cells, thereby realizing more tumor site accumulation than C-Lp.However, the clinical therapeutic efficacy of active targeting liposomes is still compromised by the mechanical desmoplastic barrier and cold tumor immunity of TNBC. The dense stroma cells act as a physical barrier against infiltration of immune cells and the liposomes. There is a positive link between desmoplasia with impaired tumor immunity and limited efficacy of liposomal delivery. Therefore, researchers have combined TEM remodeling strategies with liposomal chemotherapy. CAFs have been widely concerned as a TEM remodeling target due to the fact that desmoplasia is derived mainly from CAFs, the largest component of the stroma cells. Consequently, some researchers applied two-stage therapy for better cancer treatment (first stage for anti-CAFs drug-loaded nanodrugs administration, second stage for antitumor drug-loaded nanodrugs administration). However, such sequential targeting treatment of CAFs and tumor cells inevitably involve the decoration with targeting ligands for CAFs and tumor cells, respectively. Such overcomplicated formulation processes would pose difficulties for scale-up production and clinical translation.To solve the problem, the interaction between tumor and CAFs was investigated in our study. Cytokines are critical mediators of the crosstalk between tumor cells and their surrounding TMEs. We found that the expression of a-SMA, a hallmark of CAFs, was highly enhanced in 3T3 cells when cultured with 4T1 conditioned medium (4T1-CM), and was decreased distinctly when SB-431542, a TGF-\u03b2 receptor inhibitor, was added in 4T1-CM. It demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 secreted by 4T1 cells was essential for facilitating the conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs. The finding is consistent with the previous studies showing that TGF-\u03b2 secreted from tumor cells can activate CAFs through irritating TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1. Moreover, in our study, Rg3 was proved to inhibit tumor cells\u2019 ability to activate CAFs through regulating the TGF-\u03b2 secretion by tumor cells. In ELISA assays, the level of TGF-\u03b2 secreted form 4T1 cells in 4T1-CM was significantly decreased when pretreated with Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3). In addition, p-Smad2/3 and a-SMA expression in 3T3 cells was obviously lower in 4T1-CM@Rg3 group than those in 4T1-CM group. It means that Rg3 could effectively inhibit the activation of CAFs by suppressing the interaction between tumor and CAFs. Briefly, Rg3 is potential as an adjuvant agent combined with chemotherapy for TNBC that can prevent tumor cells from educating CAFs activation as well as promote cytotoxic efficacy of DTX. Therefore, unlike previous strategies, we only need to integrate Rg3 and DTX into a single tumor cell targeting liposome instead of the sequential targeting therapy for CAFs and tumor cells since Rg3 itself could reverse CAFs to resident stage by modulating tumor TGF-\u03b2 secretion.Owing to the excellent delivery efficiency of Rg3-Lp proved above, lower levels of TGF-\u03b2 and \u03b1-SMA expression were detected in tumor tissue in vivo in Rg3-Lp group than those in Rg3 group in ELISA, WB and flow cytometry assays. Combined with these results, our study demonstrated that Rg3 can inhibit the tumor cells-mediated CAFs activation as a TME remodeling drug and realize tumor targeting delivery as a targeting liposome membrane material simultaneously. With the decrease of activated CAFs in tumor tissues, Rg3-Lp/DTX was proved to penetrate deeper into tumor tissues by 3D stroma-rich tumor spheroid penetration assay and fully observation of the \u03b1-SMA and TUNNEL signals in tumor slices. Subsequently, immunosuppressive TME was reversed by Rg3-Lp/DTX. More CD8+ T cells and antitumor M1 phenotype infiltrated in tumors in Rg3-Lp/DTX group, turning the TME from \u201ccold\u201d to \u201chot\u201d. Collectively, Rg3-Lp/DTX showed excellent anti-TNBC efficacy, even better than the marketed DTX nano-formulation\u2014Nanoxel-PM.Herein, we designed one smart and versatile Rg3 liposome loading with DTX to achieve active tumor targeting and TME remodeling without any synthesis processes. The liposome was just composed of Rg3, phospholipids and DTX, making it very easy to prepare. Most importantly, Rg3-Lp/DTX achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect compared with Nanoxel-PM, the marketed micelles of DTX, with Rg3 as a targeting liposome material, an adjuvant with DTX and a TEM remodeling drug. The formulation is under pre-clinical studies now and of great potential to provide an effective drug for clinical treatment of TNBC.ConclusionIn summary, we successfully developed a multifunctional Rg3 liposome loading with DTX. The substitution of cholesterol with Rg3 endowed the liposome with the active targeting capacity for Glut1 overexpressed in TNBC tumor cells. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX accumulated more at tumor site compared with C-Lp/DTX. After delivered to tumor cells, TGF-\u03b2 secretion was inhibited by Rg3, which hindered tumor cells from educating resident cells into CAFs via suppressing TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling. Decreased CAFs levels in tumor led to deeper liposome penetration and activated tumor immune microenvironment. Therefore, Rg3-Lp/DTX significantly retarded the TNBC growth. It can be concluded that Rg3-Lp/DTX can achieve tumor cell targeting and cold\u2013hot tumors transformation via Rg3, thereby improving the therapeutic effect of loaded DTX. The application of the versatile liposomal system can be readily extended to other stroma-rich cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and colon cancers. Thus, this study provides a smart and simple strategy with great clinical prospects for effective cancer treatment.MethodsMaterialsCholesterol was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

All animals were treated according to the Guide for the Care and Laboratory Animals and all experiments were approved and performed according to the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Fudan University (certificate number: 2020-04-YJ-WJX-01).Preparation and characterization of liposomesThe formulation in which PL-100\u00a0M/ Rg3 (or cholesterol)/docetaxel dissolved at the weight ratio of 10:3:1 in the organic solution (chloroform: ethanol 1:1) was prepared. The obtained solution was subjected to rotary evaporation to form thin films at 48\u00a0\u2103 and then the films were hydrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at 48\u00a0\u2103 for 30\u00a0min. Rg3-Lp/DTX was then obtained by ultrasonicating the suspension with a ultrasonicator (JYD-650, Zhixin Instrument Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China). Except for the initial addition of the dye solution (coumarin 6 (C6) or DiD, 5\u00a0mg/ml, 10\u00a0\u03bcl) to the organic solvent, the preparation of fluorescent labeled liposomes were prepared with the same process as described above. The particle size and zeta potential of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were determined on a Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). Meanwhile, the morphology of the DTX-loaded liposomes was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin, FEI, USA).To examine storage stability of liposomes, the prepared liposomes were stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 for 7\u00a0days. The size and leakage of C-Lp/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX were measured every day for seven days. The mean size of the liposomes stored at 4\u00a0\u2103 were measured by DLS every day. The DTX content remaining as loaded in liposomes was tested every day to determine the change of encapsulation efficacy of DTX-loaded liposomes during the storage period using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the leakage percentage of DTX was obtained according to the following equation.Molecular dynamic simulation of Rg3-LpA 700-ns dynamic simulations at a time step of 2\u00a0fs were applied to establish the initial system (DSPC:Rg3:water molecules\u2009=\u2009128:6:10,484). Then, a larger mixed bilayer system consisting of 300 DSPC and 90 Rg3 molecules was generated with memgen tool. a total of 300\u00a0ns simulation was conducted for the system. The CHARMM36 force field was applied through MD simulations,. NPT ensemble was applied for the simulation with the Nose\u2013Hoover thermostat to keep the temperature at 300\u00a0K and the Parrinello\u2013Rhaman method to maintain a constant pressure of 1\u00a0atm. LINCS algorithm was applied for the constraint of H-bonds lengths. Partical-Mesh Ewald (PME) method was utilized to calculate the long-rang electrostatic interactions with PME grid of 0.12\u00a0nm in the reciprocal-apace interactions and cubic interpolation. The cut-off distance for the long-range neighbor list of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 12\u00a0\u00c5. Then, the obtained simulation system was visualized with the visual molecular dynamics (VMD) software.Liposome membrane micro-polarity measurement0.1\u00a0ml of the 4\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22127\u00a0M tritium solution was added in 10\u00a0ml tubes and its organic solvent was evaporated overnight. Then we added 5\u00a0ml different liposome solution respectively and sonicated them for 10\u00a0min. The mixture was left for 12\u00a0h at room temperature. The fluorescence intensities at 373\u00a0nm (I1) and 384\u00a0nm (I3) which were excited at 338\u00a0nm was recorded, respectively. The value of I1/I3 could reflect the microenvironmental polarity of the liposomal membranes.Liposome membrane fluidity measurementOne milliliter of the 2\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126\u00a0M DPH solution was mixed with 5\u00a0ml different liposomes, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the mixture was recorded (Ex/Em\u2009=\u2009360\u00a0nm/430\u00a0nm), respectively after leaving the mixture at room temperature for 12\u00a0h. The degree of polarization was obtained from the following formula: F\u2016 and F\u22a5: the fluorescence intensities of the emitted light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the polarized light of excitation; G: the grating correction factor. The value of the polarization of DPH represented the membrane fluidity. The higher the P value, the lower the membrane fluidity.Molecular docking of Glut1-Chol and Glut1-Rg3The structure of ginsenoside Rg3 and cholesterol (Chol) were constructed with Chemdraw and Chem3D was applied to converted them into three-dimensional structures. The 3D structure of Glut1 was obtained from a protein data bank with a PDB number 4PYP. Then, we imported the structure of Glut1, Chol and Rg3 in Schr\u00f6dinger maestro version 11.8. After ligand preparation, all possible conformations of Rg3 or Chol were developed. Then, each conformation of the ligands was docked to Glut1 and results were ranked with a docking score. The optimal docking conformation was determined based on the docking score and hydrogen bonding interactions. PyMol was utilized to generate the ribbon/surface view of docked complexes.Intracellular uptake assay of the liposomes by 4T1 cells2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well.

The cells were then treated with C-Lp loaded with C6 (C-Lp/C6) and Rg3-Lp loaded with C6 (Rg3-Lp/C6) respectively (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL) for 4\u00a0h. The cells were then collected, washed three times with pre-chilled PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA).Intracellular uptake of liposomes by Glut1-knockdown 4T1 cellsGlut 1 siRNA (5\u2019- CCAACUGGACCUCAAACUUTT -3\u2019) and siRNA mate were mixed in opti-MEM medium to form siRNA complexes. Then siRNA complex was added in cell culture medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 72\u00a0h. Then, C-Lp/C6 and Rg3-Lp/C6 was added in the medium respectively for 4\u00a0h (C6 100\u00a0ng/mL). The cells were prepared and analyzed by flow cytometry (CytoFlex S, Beckman Coulter, Inc., USA). For confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) observation, the cells were immunofluorescence (IF) stained and imaged as described previously.In vitro cytotoxicity studiesThe cytotoxicity of free DTX and different DTX formulations against 4T1 cells was examined with MTT cytotoxicity assay. 5\u2009\u00d7\u2009103 4T1 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. After 12\u00a0h, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, mixture of Rg3 and DTX (Rg3/DTX) and Rg3-Lp/DTX within a certain DTX concentration range was added in the medium and incubated with 4T1 cells for 48\u00a0h, respectively. 50 \u03bcL of MTT (2\u00a0mg/mL) was then added and incubated for another 4\u00a0h. Then, the medium was aspirated and 200 \u03bcL DMSO was added. After shaking for 30\u00a0min, the optical density (OD) value of each well was measured at 490\u00a0nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Trading Co., Ltd., Switzerland). The cell viability rate was calculated according to the following formula:Control: Untreated cells (viability rate 100%); Blank: (the wells with no cells).Cell apoptosis assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates per well.

Then the cells were collected and washed with PBS. Next, the cells were further stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V-FITC in binding buffer for 15\u00a0min at room temperature. The apoptosis rate of the cells was then analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).At the same time, the 4T1 cells suspension (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009105/ mL) was inoculated into 12-well plate with prepared cell sheets (0.1\u00a0ml cell suspension every cell sheet). The drug solution was changed according to the group described before after 24\u00a0h. The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33,342 and PI after 48\u00a0h of induction, then mounted with glycerol jelly mounting medium and exposed to inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, DMI4000D, Germany) for qualitative observation and photo taking.Culture and polarization induction of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM)Bone marrow cells were collected from 6\u20138-week old specific pathogen-free male Balb/c mice as described above. Bone marrow cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and cultured in fresh DMEM containing 20\u00a0ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor for 96\u00a0h to induce bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) differentiation. Interferon-\u03b3 (20\u00a0ng/mL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500\u00a0ng/mL) were added to the medium for 24\u00a0h to induce the polarization toward M1 phenotype.1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-cultured medium after different treatment was then collected. Then, 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated for 24\u00a0h with 4T1-CM plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor or with different 4T1 cultured medium collected from 4T1 cells after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1-CM@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1-CM@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX). 3T3 cultured medium collected from 3T3 cells pretreated with PBS (3T3-CM), 4T1-CM (3T3-CM @ 4T1-CM), 4T1-CM/SB-431542 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM/SB-431542)), 4T1-CM@DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@DTX)), 4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@ (4T1-CM@C-Lp/DTX)), 4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Nanoxel-PM)), 4T1-CM@Rg3 (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3)), 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp)), 4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3/DTX)) or 4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX (3T3-CM@(4T1-CM@Rg3-Lp/DTX)) were collected.

The 3T3 cells after different treatment were then IF stained and imaged with primary anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam) and Cy3-labeled fluorescent secondary antibody (33108ES60, Yeasen) according to the procedure as described before.In vivo imaging of tumor bearing mice5\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were orthotopically injected into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of Balb/c female mice to develop the orthotopic TNBC model. Treatment was initiated at about 7\u00a0days after inoculation. The tumor bearing mice were divided randomly into two groups and were injected intravenously with C-Lp/DiD and Rg3-Lp/DiD respectively. In vivo fluorescent images were taken under in vivo imaging system (IVIS) at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24\u00a0h after injection. After 24\u00a0h, the mice were killed. Tumors, hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and kidneys were then collected and imaged under IVIS system.In vivo antitumor efficacyOrthotopic TNBC model was developed by injecting 4T1 cells into a mammary fat pad in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen of BALB/c female mice. After 7\u00a0days, the mice were divided randomly into 8 groups (n\u2009=\u20096 per group) and each treated group was injected intravenously with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX (10\u00a0mg/kg of DTX) every 4\u00a0days for 20\u00a0days respectively. The length and width of tumors and the body weight were measured simultaneously. The tumor volume (V) was calculated using the following formula:Length (L) is the longest diameter and width (W) is the shortest diameter perpendicular to length. At Day 20, all mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were harvested for photo imaging and histological examination. For the histological analysis of apoptosis cells and CAFs in tumor tissue, the TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay and \u03b1-SMA staining of tumor slices was performed and full-scanned, In addition, for the histological analysis of the collagen in tumor tissue, MASSON staining was conducted and five randomly chosen microscopic fields were selected and semi-quantified by ImageJ software.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 4T1 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate per well and treated overnight with PBS, DTX, C-Lp/DTX, Nanoxel-PM, Rg3, Rg3-Lp, Rg3/DTX and Rg3-Lp/DTX respectively (DTX 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). 4T1-CM after different treatment was then collected.

The results were read using a microplate spectrophotometer at 450\u00a0nm (Thermo Multiskan MK3, USA). Tumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy and homogenized with pre-cooled PBS (5\u00a0ml PBS/1\u00a0g tumor). The prepared homogenate was centrifuged at 5000\u00a0g for 5\u00a0min and the TGF-\u03b2 concentration in the supernatant was detected with the ELISA kit (Neobioscience Co., Ltd., China) according to manufacturer's instruction.Western Blot (WB) assay3T3 cells were incubated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 cells per well and treated overnight with TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml), TGF-\u03b2 (20\u00a0ng/ml) plus SB-431542 (MCE, USA), a kind of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, different 4T1 cultured medium after treatment with PBS (4T1-CM), DTX (4T1@DTX), C-Lp/DTX (4T1@C-Lp/DTX), Nanoxel-PM (4T1@Nanoxel-PM), Rg3 (4T1@Rg3), Rg3-Lp (4T1@Rg3-Lp), Rg3/DTX (4T1@Rg3/DTX) or Rg3-Lp/DTX (4T1@Rg3-Lp/DTX) (DTX 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The protein of the cells was then harvested according to the procedures described previously. 50\u00a0mg of protein per lane were loaded on the polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was incubated with anti-\u03b1-SMA (ab124964, Abcam), anti-phospho-Smad2/3 (ab272332, Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (30202ES40, Yeasen) overnight at 4\u2103 respectively. The following procedure was performed as previously described.Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytesTumor tissues were obtained according to the protocol in In vivo antitumor efficacy. Cell suspensions derived from the obtained tumor tissues were prepared by grinding tumor tissues and passing the homogenate through 200-mesh sieve. The cell suspensions were then co-incubated with antibodies for T cells staining (CD45, CD4 and CD8), myeloid-derived suppressor cells staining (Gr1, CD11b and CD45), Tregs staining (CD45, CD4 and Foxp3), macrophages staining(CD45, F4/80, CD86 or CD206) and CAFs staining (\u03b1-SMA) for FACS analysis (BD Biosciences, USA).Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysisTotal RNAs were extracted with Trizol from tumor tissues obtained following the protocol of Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis were performed according to the procedures described before.

The mechanisms by which tumor suppressor SFRP1 influences carcinogenic properties of cancer cells do not rely on Wnt signaling, thereby demonstrating the complexity of tumor associated signaling pathways.BackgroundTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by the lack of both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression as well as overexpression or amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor HER2. Patients suffering from TNBC are not eligible for endocrine or HER2 targeted therapies, thus rendering chemotherapy the only therapeutic option, which may be accompanied by antiangiogenic approaches such as bevacizumab in the palliative setting. Up to 15% of all breast cancer patients are diagnosed with TNBC. Due to high recurrence rates and an increased risk of visceral and cerebral metastases these patients have a poorer prognosis in comparison to other breast cancer subtypes. However, patients suffering from TNBC do have an increased probability of positive response to anthracycline/taxane- containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, by achieving a pathologic complete response after neodajuvant chemotherapy the prognosis is as good as in other breast cancer subtypes. Consequently, as chemotherapy sensitivity is one of the most important prognostic factors, it is inevitable to identify biomarkers and potential mediators of chemotherapy sensitivity in patients with TNBC.The scientific goal of this study was to identify biomarkers, which may serve as mediators of chemotherapy sensitivity in TNBC. By using global gene expression profiles of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy we could identify secreted frizzled receptor protein 1 (SFRP1) as being correlated with the triple negative breast cancer subtype. Furthermore, we found a positive correlation of SFRP1 expression and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.SFRP1 has been described to antagonize canonical Wnt signaling by binding to Wnt proteins or Wnt receptors, thereby inhibiting their downstream signaling activity. In a plethora of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, it has been shown that SFRP1 is inactivated by promoter hypermethylation. In breast cancer, hypermethylation of the SFRP1 promoter has been correlated to poor prognosis, presumably due to elevated levels of Wnt signaling.By analyzing the molecular role of SFRP1 in triple negative breast cancer cells via siRNA mediated knockdown we found changes in carcinogenic properties of breast cancer cells, e.g. increased migration and invasion potential as well as reduced apoptotic events. Furthermore, we observed an increased resistance to standard cytostatic agents. Surprisingly, although SFRP1 is known to act via canonical Wnt signaling, our data suggests that its influence on triple negative breast cancer cells is apparently not mediated via this pathway.In summary, we could show that tumor suppressor and Wnt signaling antagonist SFRP1 is correlated with the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, i.e. triple negative breast cancer; but also with positive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This makes SFRP1 a potential biomarker for future stratification of triple negative breast cancer patients. Additionally, SFRP1 seems to be involved in regulatory processes necessary for tumorigenic cancer cells, e.g. regulation of apoptosis as well as migration and adhesion processes. Surprisingly, however, these mechanisms are not mediated by canonical Wnt signaling.ResultsSFRP1 expression correlates with the TNBC subtype and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapyIn order to identify genes involved in chemotherapy response in patients suffering from TNBC we made use of a published dataset analyzing global gene expression profiles of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This dataset combines pretreatment gene expression profiles with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, e.g. showing either residual disease (n\u2009=\u200999) or pathologic complete response (n\u2009=\u200934). By analyzing both gene expression profiles as well as response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy we could firstly, show that SFRP1 expression correlates with the triple negative breast cancer subtype and secondly, demonstrate association between expression of SFRP1 and positive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, i.e. achievement of a pathologic complete response (Figure\u00a01A, Tables\u00a01, 2).We next sought to analyze the expression of SFRP1 in breast cancer tissue specimen. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of tissue microarrays of breast cancer patients previously categorized as being either TNBC or non-TNBC. We detected different levels of SFRP1 expression mostly located in the tumor tissue (Figure\u00a01B). When analyzing the distinct scores of expression of SFRP1 we found strong correlation of SFRP1 expression and the triple negative breast cancer subtype (Figure\u00a01C).In addition, by using quantitative real time PCR and western blot analyses we found expression of SFRP1 in 5 out of 6 triple negative breast cancer cell lines (HCC-1937, MDA-MB-468, BT-20, MDA-MB-453 and HCC-1806), whereas no expression was detected in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 as well as the non-TNBC cell lines SKBR-3 or MCF-7 (Figure\u00a01D). These results clearly demonstrate a correlation of expression of SFRP1 and the triple negative breast cancer subtype. Additionally, there seems to be a link between the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and expression of SFRP1.Expression of SFRP1 correlates with the triple negative breast cancer subtype.

Efficiency of knockdown was proven via quantitative real-time PCR and Western Blot analysis (Figure\u00a02A).We next sought to evaluate the influence of SFRP1 knockdown to standard triple negative breast cancer chemotherapy. Therefore, we analyzed the response to chemotherapeutic agents after SFRP1 knockdown by cell viability assay. Interestingly, downregulation of SFRP1 expression rendered triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 more resistant to the chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel, cisplatinum and doxorubicin (Figure\u00a02B, left column). Another triple negative breast cancer cell line, HCC-1806, showed only increased resistance to paclitaxel (Figure\u00a02B, right column). Thus, the knockdown of SFRP1 renders cancer cells more resistant to standard chemotherapeutic treatment.Downregulation of SFRP1 renders triple negative breast cancer cells more resistant to standard chemotherapy. A) mRNA (left) and protein (right) levels of SFRP1 after siRNA mediated knockdown, as determined by qPCR and Western-Blotting, respectively. B) Chemotherapy sensitivity of MDA-MB-468 and HCC-1806 after SFRP1 knockdown was determined using MTT cell viability assay of control vs. SFRP1 knockdown cells after treatment with cytotoxic agents (significance in MDA-MB-468 for paclitaxel ***p\u2009<\u20090.001 for 10 pM-1 nM, for doxorubicin ***p\u2009<\u20090.001 for 500 pM-50 nM and for cisplatin *p\u2009<\u20090.05 for 50 nM-50\u00a0\u03bcM; no significant changes were found in HCC-1806), error bars\u2009=\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20093.Knockdown of SFRP1 enhances the carcinogenic properties of triple negative breast cancer cellsNext, we sought to explore the impact of SFRP1 on tumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells. Hence, we analyzed both migration as well as invasion potential of breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 after SFRP1 knockdown. The migratory potential was not significantly increased after knockdown. However, invasion through matrigel-coated membranes was significantly increased by about 30% after SFRP1 knockdown (Figure\u00a03A, B (left, center)). Additionally, we thought whether the rate of apoptosis is influences upon SFRP1 knockdown. Therefore, we analyzed the amount of apoptotic and necrotic cells via flow cytometry. We found a slight decrease of apoptotic as well as necrotic cells after SFRP1 knockdown (Figure\u00a03C, D). These results demonstrate a link between expression of SFRP1 and carcinogenic properties of breast cancer cells.Downregulation of SFRP1 changes carcinogenic properties of triple negative breast cancer cells. A) Representative pictures of migration and invasion filters after SFRP1 knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cells. B) Quantitative analysis of migration and invasion assays after SFRP1 knockdown revealed increase in migration of about 15% and increase in invasion potential of about 30% ((*p\u2009<\u20090.05), error bars\u2009=\u2009SD, n\u2009=\u20093) C/D) Flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V staining showed a slight decrease of cells undergoing apoptotic (C: Q4) as well as late apoptotic or necrotic events (C: Q1 and Q2).The changes of tumorigenic potential of cells after SFRP1 knockdown do not rely on Wnt signalingSFRP1 is known to antagonize Wnt signaling activity via binding to either Wnt proteins or frizzled receptors, thereby blocking the intracellular signaling cascade. Thus, we hypothesized that loss of SFRP1 might activate canonical Wnt signaling activity. Therefore, we performed a TOP-Flash/FOP-Flash luciferase assay in order to analyze the effects of SFRP1 knockdown on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. Surprisingly, we were not able to detect any changes in Wnt signaling activity of breast cancer cells after SFRP1 knockdown (Figure\u00a04A (left)). As Wnt signaling activity is known to be very low in breast cancer cells, we made use of a known Wnt activator, LiCl, in order to stimulate Wnt signaling activity. Treatment of cells with LiCl leads to a significant increase of Wnt signaling activity of about 30-fold. However, no significant changes were found in SFRP1 knockdown cells compared to control cells (Figure\u00a04A (right)). Additionally, when analyzing the cellular localization of \u03b2-Catenin by immunofluorescence staining we were not able to detect any enhanced nuclear localization of \u03b2-Catenin after SFRP1 knockdown, typically a hallmark of activated Wnt signaling (Figure\u00a04B).Influence of SFRP1 on carcinogenic properties does not rely on canonical Wnt signaling. A) Luciferase assays showed neither changes in Wnt signaling activity upon SFRP1 knockdown in breast cancer cells grown in standard medium (left 3 rows), nor in breast cancer cells grown in starvation medium followed by Wnt stimulation using LiCl treatment (right 3 rows). B) Immunofluorescence analysis showed no changes in cellular localization of \u03b2-Catenin after SFRP1 knockdown. C/D) mRNA levels of known canonical Wnt target genes (C) as well as members of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway (D) revealed no significant changes upon SFRP1 knockdown. E) mRNA levels of EMT related genes after SFRP1 knockdown. F) Model of action of SFRP1 in breast cancer.We also performed global gene expression profile analysis via microarray analysis after SFRP1 knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cells. When analyzing effects on known canonical Wnt target genes, we were not able to detect any significant changes in gene expression (Table\u00a03). In order to validate the microarray gene expression analysis data, we also performed quantitative real time PCR analysis. Although we found a decrease of approximately 60% in SFRP1 expression upon siRNA mediated knockdown, no significant changes of known Wnt target genes were observed (Figure\u00a04C). Furthermore, we analyzed the expression levels of known members of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. However, we could not detect any significant changes in expression levels of these genes (Figure\u00a04D). Since the Wnt signaling pathway is also correlated with the phenomenon of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process in which epithelial cells gain characteristics of mesenchymal cells, e.g. increased migratory or invasive potential, we also analyzed the expression levels of a plethora of known EMT related genes. Although we found an increase in known EMT related genes N-Cadherin (CDH2) as well as TWIST, the majority of EMT genes remained unaffected after SFRP1 knockdown (Figure\u00a04E). Thus, the effects of SFRP1 knockdown on carcinogenic properties on triple negative breast cancer cells do not appear to be mediated by elevated levels of canonical nor non-canonical Wnt signalling.Expression of known Wnt target genes in SFRP1-depleted MDA-MB-468 cellsName\tSEQ_ID\tRatio\t \tTCF7L2\tNM_030756\t2.37\t \tMMP7\tNM_002423\t2.28\t \tFN\tNM_054034\t1.57\t \tCDH1\tAB025105\t1.37\t \tCDH1\tAB025106\t1.31\t \tFZD7\tBC015915\t1.26\t \tVEGF\tAY263145\t1.2\t \tAXIN2\tBC101533\t1.19\t \tVEGF\tM27281\t1.16\t \tCLDN1\tBC012471\t1.16\t \tVEGF\tS85192\t1.16\t \tCDH1\tNM_004360\t1.16\t \tAXIN2\tNM_004655\t1.13\t \tCLDN1\tNM_021101\t1.08\t \tJUN\tBC006175\t1.07\t \tMYC\tNM_002467\t1.01\t \tBGLAP\tNM_199173\t0.97\t \tMYCBP\tNM_012333\t0.95\t \tID2\tNM_002166\t0.94\t \tCCND1\tNM_053056\t0.94\t \tCCND1\tBC001501\t0.94\t \tPPARD\tNM_001039694\t0.94\t \tMYCBP\tBC008686\t0.9\t \tSFRP1\tNM_003012\t0.28\t \tOnly 2 of several known Wnt target genes show increased expression after SFRP1 knockdown (List of genes available from: The Wnt homepage; http://www.stanford.edu/group/nusselab/cgi-bin/wnt/target_genes).SFRP1 influences effects of cell adhesion and apoptosisTo gain insights into the mechanism underlying effects of SFRP1 knockdown on carcinogenic properties of triple negative breast cancer cells, we performed global gene expression profiling after SFRP1 knockdown followed by gene ontology analysis. When analyzing the list of genes showing upregulation of more than 30% after knockdown by using DAVID gene ontology database (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov,) we found several genes involved in cell adhesion, cell motion as well as signaling activity (Table\u00a04). On the other hand, when analyzing genes showing downregulation of more than 25% after SFRP1 knockdown, we primarily found genes involved in positive regulation of apoptosis (Table\u00a05), which is consistent with our observed decrease in apoptotic events in these cells (Figure\u00a03C, D). Thus, SFRP1 knockdown positively regulates mechanisms of cell adhesion as well as the survival of cells presumably by inhibiting signals usually associated with apoptosis.Gene ontology analysis of genes showing upregulation of\u2009>\u2009130% after SFRP1 knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cellsTerm\tCount\tp-Value\t \tIntracellular signaling cascade\t68\t7.40E-04\t \tPositive regulation of transferase activity\t20\t1.20E-03\t \tCell motion\t31\t2.20E-03\t \tRegulation of transferase activity\t26\t2.20E-03\t \tBiological adhesion\t41\t2.80E-03\t \tCell adhesion\t41\t2.90E-03\t \tPositive regulation of kinase activity\t18\t4.40E-03\t \tMonosaccharide transport\t6\t4.70E-03\t \tRegulation of kinase activity\t24\t5.40E-03\t \tCell migration\t20\t5.60E-03\t \tGene ontology analysis of genes showing downregulation of\u2009<\u200975% after SFRP1 knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cellsTerm\tCount\tp-Value\t \tNegative regulation of cell proliferation\t19\t1.60E-05\t \tPositive regulation of apoptosis\t20\t5.00E-05\t \tPositive regulation of programmed cell death\t20\t5.50E-05\t \tPositive regulation of cell death\t20\t5.90E-05\t \tRegulation of cellular localization\t14\t1.50E-04\t \tRegulation of apoptosis\t28\t1.60E-04\t \tRegulation of programmed cell death\t28\t1.90E-04\t \tInduction of apoptosis by intracellular signals\t7\t2.00E-04\t \tRegulation of cell death\t28\t2.00E-04\t \tDiscussionTriple negative breast cancer is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype associated with poor prognosis as well as high recurrence rates. Since patients suffering from TNBC do have an unfavorable prognosis mostly due to limited therapeutic options, this cancer subtype has gained much attention regarding the development of novel targeted therapies. However, a high number of TNBC patients do positively respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As a result, achieving a pathologic complete response (pCR) is correlated with good prognosis similar to other breast cancer subtypes. Thus, the identification of patients responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy would greatly improve the therapeutic options for TNBC. Other TNBC patients, however, would need to be treated differently, e.g. by anti-angiogenic treatment.By using a published dataset analyzing differential gene expression profiles as well as response to neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment of breast cancer patients we could show a correlation of SFRP1 expression and the triple negative breast cancer subtype.We could demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines showing increased SFRP1 expression are associated with the triple negative phenotype, similar to published results showing higher expression in basal like cancer cell lines compared to luminal cell lines. Interestingly, we mainly found increased expression of SFRP1 in triple negative breast cancer cell lines, which molecularly belong to basal A subtype described by Neve et al. (HCC1937, MDA-MB-468 and BT20). Cell lines of basal A subtype display more epithelial characteristics, whereas basal B cell lines are shown to be more invasive presumably due to spindle-like morphology displaying mesenchymal as well as stem/progenitor-like characteristics.Furthermore, the basal A subtype has been correlated with increased response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy when compared to the basal B subtype. In line with these observations we could show that expression of SFRP1 is also correlated with the achievement of a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, SFRP1 might become a useful biomarker to stratify triple negative breast cancer patients, which might benefit from neoadjuvant treatment. However, for clinical applications using SFRP1 expression as a prognostic biomarker, a proper platform is needed e.g. immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) followed by conversion into dichotomous status.SFRP1 belongs to the family of 5 secreted frizzled receptor proteins, which show homology to the frizzled proteins, surface receptors for Wnt proteins. SFRP1 has been described to antagonize canonical Wnt signaling by binding to either Wnt ligand proteins or frizzled receptors, thereby inhibiting the downstream signaling cascade. SFRP1 has been linked to a number of solid tumors, e.g. colon cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer or breast cancer. It has been shown that the SFRP1 promoter is hypermethylated in these entities, thereby inactivating SFRP1 expression and its protein translation.When analyzing the influence of loss of SFRP1 in triple negative breast cancer cells we found an increase of tumor-associated characteristics, e.g. increase in migration and invasion capacity, reduced apoptotic events as well as resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Increased Wnt signaling is known to regulate tumor progression mechanisms as well as resistance to chemotherapy or radiation. Thus, we initially hypothesized that knockdown of SFRP1 might result in increased Wnt signaling activity, thereby promoting tumor-associated properties of cells. This would be in line with previously published data showing reduced xenograft growth after SFRP1 overexpression in breast cancer cells presumably due to blockade of canonical Wnt signaling activity.Surprisingly, however, we were neither able to detect Wnt activation by TOPFlash luciferase assays, changes in cellular localization of \u03b2-Catenin, nor detect any significant upregulation of known Wnt target genes. Therefore, we propose a different mechanism at which SFRP1 influences tumorigenic properties like invasion potential or resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. However, a Wnt dependent effect may also occur in triple negative cancers as in vivo Wnt signals may be supplied from the tumor stroma. Thus, Wnt dependent effects may also be contributing to the in vivo responsiveness of triple negative breast cancer patients to chemotherapy.In addition to its known role in Wnt signaling, recent reports also demonstrate novel roles for SFRP1 signaling. One report showed binding of SFRP1 to thrombospondin-1, thereby inhibiting cancer cell adhesion and migration. This binding was conducted via the netrin related motif of SFRP1. These data are in accordance with our observation of increased invasiveness of SFRP1-depleted cells. Another study demonstrated an increased sensitivity of cells to TGF-\u03b2 signaling upon SFRP1 reduction. The TGF-\u03b2 pathway is involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as cellular migration in later stage mammary tumors, despite its known function as a tumor suppressor in early stage malignancies. However, as expression of a majority of known EMT related genes are not substantially altered upon SFRP1 knockdown (Figure\u00a04E), EMT may be of minor relevance in our experimental system. Recently, another study demonstrated a link between reduction of SFRP1 and reduction of apoptosis in vitro. By using global gene expression profiles after SFRP1 knockdown, gene ontology analyses revealed upregulation of genes involved in migration processes, whereas genes involved in the positive regulation of apoptosis were downregulated (Tables\u00a04, 5). Thus, chemotherapy might be reinforced by inhibition of apoptosis after SFRP1 knockdown. This view is supported by our observation of a slight decrease of apoptotic events upon SFRP1 depletion (Figure\u00a03C, D). Apparently, pathways different from Wnt signaling presumably regulate processes that lead to increase of tumorigenic properties of cancer cells.ConclusionsOur study sheds light on the complex regulatory network of mammary tumorigenesis and tumor progression, proposing a model in which SFRP1 regulates either invasive processes via canonical Wnt signaling but also via different pathways, e.g. TGF-\u03b2 signaling as well as apoptotic processes via so far unknown mechanisms (Figure\u00a04F).Furthermore, we conclude that SFRP1 might be clinically used to stratify patients, which suffer from triple negative breast cancer for responding to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As the reduction of SFRP1 is in line with increased aggressiveness of cancer cells, its overexpression might be an approach to explore novel therapeutic projections. Thus, an increased level of SFRP1 might sensitize triple negative breast cancer patients towards chemotherapy, thereby improving prognosis of this aggressive breast cancer subtype. Nevertheless, future analyses have to be undertaken to explore the role of SFRP1 in regulating mammary tumor progression, particularly progression of triple negative breast cancer.MethodsCell culture, chemicalsThe human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10a and the cancerous cell lines HCC 1937, MDA-MB 468, BT-20, MDA-MB 453, HCC 1806, MDA-MB 231, SKBR-3 and MCF-7 were supplied from ATCC and cultured under recommended conditions. Medium, trypsin-EDTA, PBS, fetal calf serum and horse serum were received from PAA Laboratories.In order to chemically stimulate Wnt signaling, cells were starved in medium without serum for 24\u00a0h followed by incubation with 10\u00a0mM LiCl (SIGMA Aldrich), which inhibits GSK3\u03b2, thereby activating Wnt signaling.Microarray gene expression analysesA published microarray dataset was used for differential gene expression analysis. For gene expression analysis in patients, triple negative breast cancer was defined using clinical measurements for ER, PR and HER2 as described previously and compared to the remaining cases merged as non-TNBC. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was defined as absence of invasive breast cancer cells at the time of definitive surgery and dichotomized as either pCR (n\u2009=\u200934) or residual invasive disease (RD; n\u2009=\u200999). Among cases with TNBC, 13 cases had pCR and 14 cases had RD. Gene expression data was processed and normalized using the robust multiarray average normalization algorithm as implemented in R-package affy version 1.32.0.Differential gene expression between patient subgroups was assessed using Welch's t statistic. The resulting p values were adjusted for control of the false discovery rate (FDR) according to Benjamini and Hochberg's method. Analyses were performed in R using the Bioconductor multitest package version 2.10.0.For microarray experiments after SFRP1 knockdown in MDA-MB-468 cells, mRNA was converted into cDNA by using Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufactures protocol. Fluorescence labeling was performed using NimbleGen One-Color DNA Labeling Kit followed by hybridization onto arrays (NimbleGen human gene expression 12 \u00d7 135k arrays) according to protocol. By using DEVA software raw data was extracted. Further normalization was performed using GeneSpring Software. Normalized values were imported into gene ontology database DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov.For expression analysis Wnt target genes were identified using the Wnt Homepage (http://www.stanford.edu/group/nusselab/cgi-bin/wnt/target_genes).Western Blot analysisCells were incubated with RIPA buffer (10\u00a0mM NaF, 1\u00a0mM Na3VO4, 10\u00a0mM \u03b2-Glycerophosphate, 7.6\u00a0mM Tris pH\u00a07.4, 52\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100, 0.8\u00a0mM EDTA, proteinase inhibitor (SIGMA Aldrich). Protein quantification was performed via BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. SDS page electrophoresis and blotting were performed using standard protocols. Detection was performed using SFRP1 antibody (SIGMA Aldrich, SAB2900383) and \u03b2-Actin antibody (BioLegend, clone # 2\u00a0F1-1) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Bands were visualized with AGFA developer and fixer (AGFA).Quantitative real-time PCRRNA isolation was performed using NucleoSpin RNA Kits (Macherey-Nagel) with on-column DNase digestion. Reverse transcription for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed using MMLV reverse transcriptase (USB (Affymetrix)) and Oligo-dT15 priming at 42\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hour and at 60\u00b0C for 10\u00a0minutes. A cDNA equivalent of 50\u00a0ng total RNA was used as template in a total reaction volume of 20\u00a0\u03bcl with Power SYBR Green PCR mix (Invitrogen) on an Step One Plus cycler (ABI). Primers were added at 0.375\u00a0\u03bcM each. Calculations were based on the \u0394\u0394Ct method using two housekeeping genes for normalization. Real time primer sequences can be found in supplemental Table\u00a01 (Additional file 1: Table S1).siRNA mediated mRNA knockdownsiRNA mediated knockdown assays were implemented using SFRP1 siRNA (part no 4392422) and negative control siRNA (part no 4390844) (Applied Biosystems) in combination with DharmaFECT (ThermoScientific) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Efficacy of knockdown was analyzed by qPCR and Western blotting 48\u00a0h \u2013 72\u00a0h after transfection.Cell migration / invasion assayFor migration assays, cell culture inserts equipped with 8\u00a0\u03bcm membranes were used (Falcon). For invasion assays, BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. Briefly, 24 \u2013 48\u00a0h after transfection, 2 \u2013 5 \u00d7104 cells were seeded into cell culture inserts in medium without serum. The lower chamber was filled with medium containing serum as chemoattractant. 48 \u2013 96\u00a0h after seeding cells, which passed the membranes, were fixed and stained using Diff-Quik staining set according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Medion Diagnostics). Stained filters were mounted on microscope slides with VitroClud (Langenbrinck). Quantitative analysis was done by cell counting using Image J software.Luciferase assayLuciferase assays were performed using TOPFlash or FOPFlash plasmids (addgene plasmid numbers 1256 and 12457, respectively) along with renilla normalization construct (pRL-TK, Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase constructs were transfected 48\u00a0h after siRNA transfection. Starvation medium as well as normal medium was changed the next day. After additional 24\u00a0h, cells were harvested and processed according to the DualGlo Luciferase protocol (Promega). Relative Luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the FOPFlash mutant vector control.Immunohistochemistry/ImmunocytochemistryThe study was approved by the local ethical review committee (Research ethics committee of the Medical Association Westfalen-Lippe and Westphalian Wilhelms University; ethical vote: 2013-156-f-S). We used tissue microarrays of 362 patients. Of these, 37 were diagnosed as being TNBC by missing expression of ER, PR and HER2. Immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays was performed using primary antibody (SFRP1, Epitomics, clone# EPR7003) and biotinylated secondary antibodies (DAKO). Detection was performed using Chromogen Red (DAKO) and H&E (Merck). Slides were embedded with Scientific Cytoseal (Thermo Scientific Fisher).For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with phosphate buffered formalin. Cells were blocked with 10% Aurion (DAKO) in PBS for 1\u00a0h. Cells were washed and incubated with primary antibody (\u03b2-Catenin, Cell Signaling, # 9587) diluted with Dako REALTM Antibody Diluent (overnight at 4\u00b0C). Fluorescent visualization was carried out using suitable Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (1:600) together with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:400) in in Dako REALTM Antibody Diluent) for 1\u00a0h at RT.Chemotherapy sensitivity assayFor analysis of chemotherapy sensitivity, cells were incubated with cytotoxic agents using decreasing concentrations: paclitaxel (10 pM - 1\u00a0\u03bcM), doxorubicin hydrochloride (500 pM - 50\u00a0\u03bcM), cis-diamineplatinum II dichloride (50 nM - 5\u00a0mM). After 96\u00a0hours, cell viability was determined via MTT (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide) (all substances were received from SIGMA Aldrich) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Measurements were performed at least in triplicates. Significance was calculated via one-side Welch\u2019s\u00a0t-test.Flow cytometryFollowing transfection cells were stained for apoptosis as well as apoptosis/necrosis using the annexin V test kit from Becton Dickinson (San Jos\u00e9, USA). Flow cytometric cell analysis and quantification of cell death took place on a flow cytometer (CyFlow Space, Partec, Germany) as described previously.ConsentWritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for the publication of this report and any accompanying images.AbbreviationsSFRP1: Secreted frizzled receptor protein 1; HER2: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; TNBC: Triple negative breast cancer; siRNA: Small interfering RNA; ER: Estrogen receptor; PR: Progesterone receptor; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction; LiCl: Lithium chloride; pCR: Pathologic complete response; IHC: Immunohistochemistry; FISH: Fluorescence in situ hybridization; RD: Residual disease; EMT: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Competing interestsThe authors declare no conflict of interests.Authors\u2019 contributionC.B. conception and design, collection and/or assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing, final approval of manuscript, C.H. conception and design, collection and/or assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation, manuscript writing; C.R. data analysis and interpretation; S.S. and L.B. provision of study materials; G.H. and M.G. data analysis and interpretation; B.G. and P.J.B. collection and/or assembly of data, data analysis and interpretation; L.K. conception and design, financial support; C.L.: conception and design, data analysis and interpretation.
