    "## Potential Rules for Nectin3 in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs) **Rule 1:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nectin3 decreases transform to activated from 0.01 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.2 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** While the documents provided don't directly address Nectin3's role in CAF activation, they highlight the importance of cell-cell adhesion in tumor progression and metastasis. Nectin3 is known to be a key component in the formation of cell junctions and a putative suppressor molecule to the invasion of breast cancer cells [Document 16]. Therefore, a decrease in Nectin3 expression in CAFs could potentially lead to a more activated state, promoting tumor growth and invasion. **Rule 2:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nectin3 increases cell-cell adhesion with malignant epithelial cells from 0 towards 1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Nectin3 is known to be involved in the formation of cell-cell adhesions [Document 16]. This rule reflects the potential for Nectin3 to strengthen the interaction between CAFs and malignant epithelial cells, potentially contributing to tumor cell survival and growth. **Rule 3:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nectin3 decreases migration speed from 1 towards 0.1 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.1 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** Nectin3 is known to be a putative suppressor molecule to the invasion of breast cancer cells [Document 16]. This rule reflects the potential for Nectin3 to reduce CAF motility, potentially limiting their ability to contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis. **Rule 4:** In cancer-associated fibroblasts, Nectin3 decreases secretion of pro-inflammatory factors from 10 towards 0 with a Hill response, with half-max 0.5 and Hill power 4. **Justification:** While the documents provided don't directly address Nectin3's role in CAF cytokine secretion, they highlight the importance of CAFs in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Nectin3 is known to be a putative suppressor molecule to the invasion of breast cancer cells [Document 16]. Therefore, a decrease in Nectin3 expression in CAFs could potentially lead to a more pro-inflammatory state, promoting tumor growth and invasion. **Note:** These rules are based on the available information and require further investigation and validation. The specific parameters (half-max, Hill power) are hypothetical and should be adjusted based on experimental data. "
